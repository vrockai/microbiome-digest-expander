Research into the brain-gut-microbiota axis (BGMA) continues to reveal associations between gut microbiota (GM) and psychological symptom expression, inspiring new ways of conceptualising psychological disorders. However, before GM modulation can be touted as a possible auxiliary treatment option, more research is needed as inconsistencies in previous findings regarding these associations are prevalent. Additionally, the concept of the microgenderome, which proposes that GM may interact with sex hormones, has received limited attention in studies using human samples to date. However, such research has demonstrated sex specific associations between GM and psychological symptom expression.

Dietary habits have a profound influence on the metabolic activity of gut microorganisms and their influence on health. Concerns have been raised as to whether the consumption of foodstuffs contaminated with pesticides can contribute to the development of chronic disease by affecting the gut microbiome. We performed the first pesticide biomonitoring survey of the British population, and subsequently used the results to perform the first pesticide association study on gut microbiome composition and function from the TwinsUK registry.

## Diversity and Metabolic Potential of the Gut Microbiome in Adolescents with Functional Bowel Disorder.
 02.05.2022, _ES Klimenko, NL Belkova, AI Romanitsa, AV Pogodina, LV Rychkova_


The article presents the results of a pilot study of the diversity and metabolic potential of the gut microbiome in adolescents with various forms of functional bowel disorder. The participants were the patients of the Clinic of Research Center for Family Health and Human Reproduction Problems. Biological material was studied using metagenomic sequencing of V3-V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We showed that the composition of the minor component of the intestinal microbiome in adolescents with functional bowel disorder differs from that in the healthy subjects (control). Different types of transit disturbances in functional bowel disorder also differ from each other. According to the metabolic potential, adolescents can be divided into two groups irrespective of the pathophysiological manifestations: for one group, a more intensive metabolism in amino acid and lipid biosynthesis pathways was predicted than for the other.

## Diet-microbiome interactions in cancer treatment: Opportunities and challenges for precision nutrition in cancer.
 04.05.2022, _KL Greathouse, M Wyatt, AJ Johnson, EP Toy, JM Khan, K Dunn, DJ Clegg, S Reddy_


Dietary patterns contribute to cancer risk. Separately, microbial factors influence the development of several cancers. However, the interaction of diet and the microbiome and their joint contribution to cancer treatment response needs more research. The microbiome significantly impacts drug metabolism, immune activation, and response to immunotherapy. One of the critical factors affecting the microbiome structure and function is diet. Data demonstrate that the diet and microbiome composition affects the immune response. Moreover, malnutrition is a significant confounder to cancer therapy response. There is little understanding of the interaction of malnutrition with the microbiome in the context of cancer. This review aims to address the current knowledge of dietary intake patterns and malnutrition among cancer patients and the impact on treatment outcomes. Second, this review will provide evidence linking the microbiome to cancer treatment response and provide evidence of the potentially strong effect that diet could have on this interaction. This review will formulate critical questions that will need further research to understand the diet-microbiome relationship in cancer treatment response and directions for future research to guide us to precision nutrition therapy to improve cancer outcomes.

## Bacteria and Bellicosity: Photoperiodic Shifts in Gut Microbiota Drive Seasonal Aggressive Behavior in Male Siberian Hamsters.
 03.05.2022, _EK Shor, SP Brown, DA Freeman_


The existence of a microbiome-gut-brain axis has been established wherein gut microbiota significantly impacts host behavior and physiology, with increasing evidence suggesting a role for the gut microbiota in maintaining host homeostasis. Communication between the gut microbiota and the host is bidirectional, and shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota are dependent on both internal and external cues (host-derived signals, such as stress and immunity, and endocrine and environmental signals, such as photoperiod). Although there is host-driven seasonal variation in the composition of the microbiota, the mechanisms linking photoperiod, gut microbiota, and host behavior have not been characterized. The results of the present study suggest that seasonal changes in the gut microbiota drive seasonal changes in aggression. Implanting short-day Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) with fecal microbiota from long-day hamsters resulted in a reversal of seasonal aggression, whereby short-day hamsters displayed aggression levels typical of long-day hamsters. In addition, there are correlations between aggressive behavior and several bacterial taxa. These results implicate the gut microbiota as part of the photoperiodic mechanism regulating seasonal host behavior and contribute toward a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between the microbiota, host, and environment.

## Microbial DNA enrichment promotes liver steatosis and fibrosis in the course of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
 02.05.2022, _Z Luo, Y Ji, D Zhang, H Gao, Z Jin, M Yang, W Ying_


Low-grade inflammation is the hallmark of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The leakage of microbiota-derived products can contribute to liver inflammation during NAFLD/NASH development. Here we assessed the roles of gut microbial DNA-containing extracellular vesicles (mEVs) in regulating liver cellular abnormalities in the course of NAFLD/NASH.

## Geographical resistome profiling in the honeybee microbiome reveals resistance gene transfer conferred by mobilizable plasmids.

The spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has been of global concern as one of the greatest environmental threats. The gut microbiome of animals has been found to be a large reservoir of ARGs, which is also an indicator of the environmental antibiotic spectrum. The conserved microbiota makes the honeybee a tractable and confined ecosystem for studying the maintenance and transfer of ARGs across gut bacteria. Although it has been found that honeybee gut bacteria harbor diverse sets of ARGs, the influences of environmental variables and the mechanism driving their distribution remain unclear.

## Phytobeneficial traits of rhizobacteria under the control of multiple molecular dialogues.
 03.05.2022, _A Laveilh√©, S Fochesato, D Lalaouna, T Heulin, W Achouak_


Pseudomonads play crucial roles in plant growth promotion and control of plant diseases. However, under natural conditions, other microorganisms competing for the same nutrient resources in the rhizosphere may exert negative control over their phytobeneficial characteristics. We assessed the expression of phytobeneficial genes involved in biocontrol, biostimulation and iron regulation such as, phlD, hcnA, acdS, and iron-small regulatory RNAs prrF1 and prrF2 in Pseudomonas brassicacearum co-cultivated with three phytopathogenic fungi, and two rhizobacteria in the presence or absence of Brassica napus, and in relation to iron availability. We found that the antifungal activity of P. brassicacearum depends mostly on the production of DAPG and not on HCN whose production is suppressed by fungi. We have also shown that the two-competing bacterial strains modulate the plant growth promotion activity of P. brassicacearum by modifying the expression of phlD, hcnA and acdS according to iron availability. Overall, it allows us to better understand the complexity of the multiple molecular dialogues that take place underground between microorganisms and between plants and its rhizosphere microbiota and to show that synergy in favour of phytobeneficial gene expression may exist between different bacterial species.
