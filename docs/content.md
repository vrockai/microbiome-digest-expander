## Co- and polymicrobial infections in the gut mucosa: the host-microbiota-pathogen perspective.
 11.10.2020, _T Frisan_


Infections in humans occur in the context of complex niches where the pathogen interacts with both the host microenvironment and immune response, and the symbiotic microbial community. The polymicrobial nature of many human infections add a further layer of complexity. The effect of co- or polymicrobial infections can result in enhanced severity due to pathogens cooperative interaction or reduced morbidity because one of the pathogens affects the fitness of the other(s). In this review, the concept of co-infections and polymicrobial interactions in the context of the intestinal mucosa is discussed, focusing on the interplay between the host, the microbiota and the pathogenic organisms. Specifically, we will examine examples of pathogen-cooperative versus -antagonistic behavior during co- and polymicrobial infections. We discuss: the infection-induced modulation of the host microenvironment and immune responses; the direct modulation of the microorganism's fitness; the potentiation of inflammatory/carcinogenic conditions by polymicrobial biofilms; and the promotion of co-infections by microbial-induced DNA damage. Open questions in this very exciting field are also highlighted. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

## Gut microbiota composition is associated with narcolepsy type 1.
 12.10.2020, _A Lecomte, L Barateau, P Pereira, L Paulin, P Auvinen, F Scheperjans, Y Dauvilliers_


To test the hypothesis that narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is related to the gut microbiota, we compared the microbiota bacterial communities of patients with NT1 and control subjects.
