_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Gut microbiome and breast-feeding: Implications for early immune development.
 08.09.2022, _EC Davis, VP Castagna, DA Sela, MA Hillard, S Lindberg, NJ Mantis, AE Seppo, KM Järvinen_


Establishment of the gut microbiome during early life is a complex process with lasting implications for an individual's health. Several factors influence microbial assembly; however, breast-feeding is recognized as one of the most influential drivers of gut microbiome composition during infancy, with potential implications for function. Differences in gut microbial communities between breast-fed and formula-fed infants have been consistently observed and are hypothesized to partially mediate the relationships between breast-feeding and decreased risk for numerous communicable and noncommunicable diseases in early life. Despite decades of research on the gut microbiome of breast-fed infants, there are large scientific gaps in understanding how human milk has evolved to support microbial and immune development. This review will summarize the evidence on how breast-feeding broadly affects the composition and function of the early-life gut microbiome and discuss mechanisms by which specific human milk components shape intestinal bacterial colonization, succession, and function.

## Capturing the antibiotic resistome of preterm infants reveals new benefits of probiotic supplementation.

Probiotic use in preterm infants can mitigate the impact of antibiotic exposure and reduce rates of certain illnesses; however, the benefit on the gut resistome, the collection of antibiotic resistance genes, requires further investigation. We hypothesized that probiotic supplementation of early preterm infants (born &lt; 32-week gestation) while in hospital reduces the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes associated with pathogenic bacteria in the gut. We used a targeted capture approach to compare the resistome from stool samples collected at the term corrected age of 40 weeks for two groups of preterm infants (those that routinely received a multi-strain probiotic during hospitalization and those that did not) with samples from full-term infants at 10 days of age to identify if preterm birth or probiotic supplementation impacted the resistome. We also compared the two groups of preterm infants up to 5 months of age to identify persistent antibiotic resistance genes.

## Soil microbiomes and one health.
 23.08.2022, _S Banerjee, MGA van der Heijden_


The concept of one health highlights that human health is not isolated but connected to the health of animals, plants and environments. In this Review, we demonstrate that soils are a cornerstone of one health and serve as a source and reservoir of pathogens, beneficial microorganisms and the overall microbial diversity in a wide range of organisms and ecosystems. We list more than 40 soil microbiome functions that either directly or indirectly contribute to soil, plant, animal and human health. We identify microorganisms that are shared between different one health compartments and show that soil, plant and human microbiomes are perhaps more interconnected than previously thought. Our Review further evaluates soil microbial contributions to one health in the light of dysbiosis and global change and demonstrates that microbial diversity is generally positively associated with one health. Finally, we present future challenges in one health research and formulate recommendations for practice and evaluation.

## Corncob structures in dental plaque reveal microhabitat taxon specificity.

The human mouth is a natural laboratory for studying how bacterial communities differ across habitats. Different bacteria colonize different surfaces in the mouth-teeth, tongue dorsum, and keratinized and non-keratinized epithelia-despite the short physical distance between these habitats and their connection through saliva. We sought to determine whether more tightly defined microhabitats might have more tightly defined sets of resident bacteria. A microhabitat may be characterized, for example, as the space adjacent to a particular species of bacterium. Corncob structures of dental plaque, consisting of coccoid bacteria bound to filaments of Corynebacterium cells, present an opportunity to analyze the community structure of one such well-defined microhabitat within a complex natural biofilm. Here, we investigate by fluorescence in situ hybridization and spectral imaging the composition of the cocci decorating the filaments.

## Can the stable isotope variability in a zooplankton time series be explained by its key species?
 08.09.2022, _M Brito-Lolaia, GGAA Figueiredo, S Neumann-Leitão, GT Yogui, R Schwamborn_


Stable isotope (SI) analysis is a standard tool to study marine food webs, usually based on the measurement of a few individuals from a small list of subjectively pre-defined species. The main objective of this study was to find out which species are significantly associated with the temporal variability of the SI composition of zooplankton in a tropical marine ecosystem. We investigated this by means of a novel species-biomass-isotopes-mixture (SBIM) approach that uses a relative biomass matrix to explain the SI signature of the zooplankton community. Furthermore, SBIM was applied to detect key taxa that can be considered bioindicators for important descriptors of ecosystem state (e.g., oligotrophy, carbon sources, mean trophic level). Plankton samples (64 μm mesh size) were obtained in Tamandaré Bay (northeastern Brazil) from June 2013 to August 2019. One aliquot of each sample was taken for stable isotope measurements and one for taxonomic identification and estimation of size and relative biomass. Total zooplankton biomass differed significantly between years, seasons and stations. Total zooplankton δ13C values ranged from -21.0 to -18.2‰ (mean ± standard deviation: -19.7 ± 0.7‰ in the dry season, and -19.4 ± 0.8‰ in the rainy season). Total zooplankton δ15N values ranged from 3.8 to 9.0‰ (7.0 ± 1.0‰ in the dry season, and 6.5 ± 1.2‰ rainy season). Total zooplankton C/N ratios ranged from 3.5 to 5.0 (4.2 ± 0.4 in the dry season and 4.2 ± 0.3 in the rainy season). The sparsely abundant and relatively large-sized copepod Pseudodiaptomus acutus was the most important species for explaining the variability in δ15N (22% of the total variability). Relative biomass (%) of P. acutus showed a strong positive correlation with δ15N, indicating a high trophic level (TL). Our results highlight the importance of less abundant taxa for marine food webs. Small-sized invertebrate larvae were negatively correlated with δ15N, indicating a TL below average. The copepod Dioithona oculata was the most important organism in explaining the δ13C of zooplankton (17.7% of the total variability, positive correlation with δ13C), indicating possible selective use of a13C-enriched food source (e.g., diatoms) by this cyclopoid copepod. Oithona spp. juveniles showed a negative relationship with zooplankton C/N ratio, which can be indicators of an oligotrophic ecosystem state and lipid-poor zooplankton. The tintinnid F. ehrenbergii showed a positive correlation with C/N, being an indicator for turbid "green waters'', during the rainy season, when the ecosystem was in a eutrophic state, with high lipid contents in the zooplankton community. The proposed SBIM approach opens up a novel pathway to understanding the factors and species that shape the temporal variability of food webs.

## Mutualistic interplay between bacteriophages and bacteria in the human gut.
 30.06.2022, _AN Shkoporov, CJ Turkington, C Hill_


Bacteriophages (phages) are often described as obligate predators of their bacterial hosts, and phage predation is one of the leading forces controlling the density and distribution of bacterial populations. Every 48 h half of all bacteria on Earth are killed by phages. Efficient killing also forms the basis of phage therapy in humans and animals and the use of phages as food preservatives. In turn, bacteria have a plethora of resistance systems against phage attack, but very few bacterial species, if any, have entirely escaped phage predation. However, in complex communities and environments such as the human gut, this antagonistic model of attack and counter-defence does not fully describe the scope of phage-bacterium interactions. In this Review, we explore some of the more mutualistic aspects of phage-bacterium interactions in the human gut, and we suggest that the relationship between phages and their bacterial hosts in the gut is best characterized not as a fight to the death between enemies but rather as a mutualistic relationship between partners.

## Identification of trypsin-degrading commensals in the large intestine.

Increased levels of proteases, such as trypsin, in the distal intestine have been implicated in intestinal pathological conditions1-3. However, the players and mechanisms that underlie protease regulation in the intestinal lumen have remained unclear. Here we show that Paraprevotella strains isolated from the faecal microbiome of healthy human donors are potent trypsin-degrading commensals. Mechanistically, Paraprevotella recruit trypsin to the bacterial surface through type IX secretion system-dependent polysaccharide-anchoring proteins to promote trypsin autolysis. Paraprevotella colonization protects IgA from trypsin degradation and enhances the effectiveness of oral vaccines against Citrobacter rodentium. Moreover, Paraprevotella colonization inhibits lethal infection with murine hepatitis virus-2, a mouse coronavirus that is dependent on trypsin and trypsin-like proteases for entry into host cells4,5. Consistently, carriage of putative genes involved in trypsin degradation in the gut microbiome was associated with reduced severity of diarrhoea in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, trypsin-degrading commensal colonization may contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protection from pathogen infection.

## Microbiota imbalance induced by dietary sugar disrupts immune-mediated protection from metabolic syndrome.
 30.08.2022, _Y Kawano, M Edwards, Y Huang, AM Bilate, LP Araujo, T Tanoue, K Atarashi, MS Ladinsky, SL Reiner, HH Wang, D Mucida, K Honda, II Ivanov_


How intestinal microbes regulate metabolic syndrome is incompletely understood. We show that intestinal microbiota protects against development of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and pre-diabetic phenotypes by inducing commensal-specific Th17 cells. High-fat, high-sugar diet promoted metabolic disease by depleting Th17-inducing microbes, and recovery of commensal Th17 cells restored protection. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells afforded protection by regulating lipid absorption across intestinal epithelium in an IL-17-dependent manner. Diet-induced loss of protective Th17 cells was mediated by the presence of sugar. Eliminating sugar from high-fat diets protected mice from obesity and metabolic syndrome in a manner dependent on commensal-specific Th17 cells. Sugar and ILC3 promoted outgrowth of Faecalibaculum rodentium that displaced Th17-inducing microbiota. These results define dietary and microbiota factors posing risk for metabolic syndrome. They also define a microbiota-dependent mechanism for immuno-pathogenicity of dietary sugar and highlight an elaborate interaction between diet, microbiota, and intestinal immunity in regulation of metabolic disorders.

Efforts to model the human gut microbiome in mice have led to important insights into the mechanisms of host-microbe interactions. However, the model communities studied to date have been defined or complex, but not both, limiting their utility. Here, we construct and characterize in vitro a defined community of 104 bacterial species composed of the most common taxa from the human gut microbiota (hCom1). We then used an iterative experimental process to fill open niches: germ-free mice were colonized with hCom1 and then challenged with a human fecal sample. We identified new species that engrafted following fecal challenge and added them to hCom1, yielding hCom2. In gnotobiotic mice, hCom2 exhibited increased stability to fecal challenge and robust colonization resistance against pathogenic Escherichia coli. Mice colonized by either hCom2 or a human fecal community are phenotypically similar, suggesting that this consortium will enable a mechanistic interrogation of species and genes on microbiome-associated phenotypes.

## From germ-free to wild: modulating microbiome complexity to understand mucosal immunology.
 06.09.2022, _CA Thomson, SC Morgan, C Ohland, KD McCoy_


The gut microbiota influences host responses at practically every level, and as research into host-microbe interactions expands, it is not surprising that we are uncovering similar roles for the microbiota at other barrier sites, such as the lung and skin. Using standard laboratory mice to assess host-microbe interactions, or even host intrinsic responses, can be challenging, as slight variations in the microbiota can affect experimental outcomes. When it comes to designing and selecting an appropriate level of microbial diversity and community structure for colonization of our laboratory rodents, we have more choices available to us than ever before. Here we will discuss the different approaches used to modulate microbial complexity that are available to study host-microbe interactions. We will describe how different models have been used to answer distinct biological questions, covering the entire microbial spectrum, from germ-free to wild.
