Inquiry of microbiota involvement in kidney stone disease (KSD) has largely focussed on potential oxalate handling abilities by gut bacteria and the increased association with antibiotic exposure. By systematically comparing the gut, urinary, and oral microbiota of 83 stone formers (SF) and 30 healthy controls (HC), we provide a unified assessment of the bacterial contribution to KSD.

## Culturing the unculturables: strategies, challenges, and opportunities for gut microbiome study.
 25.11.2023, _A Yadav, S Ahlawat, KK Sharma_


Metagenome sequencing techniques revolutionized the field of gut microbiome study. However, it is equipped with experimental and computational biases which affect the downstream analysis results. Also, live microbial strains is needed for a better understanding of host-microbial crosstalks and for designing next-generation treatment therapies based on probiotic strains and postbiotic molecules. Conventional culturing methodologies are insufficient to get the dark gut matter on the plate; therefore, there is an urgent need to propose novel culturing methods that can fill the limitations of metagenomic. The current work aims to provide a consolidated evaluation of the available methods for host-microbe interaction with an emphasis on in vitro culturing of gut microbes using organoids, gut on a chip, and gut bioreactor. Further, the knowledge of microbial crosstalk in the gut helps us to identify core microbiota, and key metabolites that will aid in designing culturing media and co-culturing systems for gut microbiome study. After the deeper mining of the current culturing methods, we recommend that 3-D printed intestinal cells in a multistage continuous flow reactor equipped with an extended organoid system might be a good practical choice for gut microbiota-based studies.

Diet-derived nutrients are inextricably linked to human physiology by providing energy and biosynthetic building blocks and by functioning as regulatory molecules. However, the mechanisms by which circulating nutrients in the human body influence specific physiological processes remain largely unknown. Here we use a blood nutrient compound library-based screening approach to demonstrate that dietary trans-vaccenic acid (TVA) directly promotes effector CD8+ T cell function and anti-tumour immunity in vivo. TVA is the predominant form of trans-fatty acids enriched in human milk, but the human body cannot produce TVA endogenously1. Circulating TVA in humans is mainly from ruminant-derived foods including beef, lamb and dairy products such as milk and butter2,3, but only around 19% or 12% of dietary TVA is converted to rumenic acid by humans or mice, respectively4,5. Mechanistically, TVA inactivates the cell-surface receptor GPR43, an immunomodulatory G protein-coupled receptor activated by its short-chain fatty acid ligands6-8. TVA thus antagonizes the short-chain fatty acid agonists of GPR43, leading to activation of the cAMP-PKA-CREB axis for enhanced CD8+ T cell function. These findings reveal that diet-derived TVA represents a mechanism for host-extrinsic reprogramming of CD8+ T cells as opposed to the intrahost gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids. TVA thus has translational potential for the treatment of tumours.

_Animals, Frailty, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Genome-Wide Association Study, Mendelian Randomization Analysis, Animal Experimentation_
Observational studies have shown that the gut microbiome is associated with frailty. However, whether these associations underlie causal effects remains unknown. Thus, this study aimed to assess the genetic correlation and causal relationships between the genetically predicted gut microbiome and frailty using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and Mendelian Randomization (MR). Summary statistics for the gut microbiome were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of the MiBioGen consortium (N = 18,340). Summary statistics for frailty were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis, including the UK Biobank and TwinGene (N = 175,226). We used LDSC and MR analyses to estimate the genetic correlation and causality between the genetically predicted gut microbiome and frailty. Our findings indicate a suggestive genetic correlation between Christensenellaceae R-7 and frailty. Moreover, we found evidence for suggestive causal effects of twelve genus-level gut microbes on frailty using at least two MR methods. There was no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity in the MR analysis. This study provides suggestive evidence for a potential genetic correlation and causal association between several genetically predicted gut microbes and frailty. More population-based observational studies and animal experiments are required to clarify this association and the underlying mechanisms.

## Metabolic exchanges are ubiquitous in natural microbial communities.
 23.11.2023, _C Kost, KR Patil, J Friedman, SL Garcia, M Ralser_


Microbial communities drive global biogeochemical cycles and shape the health of plants and animals-including humans. Their structure and function are determined by ecological and environmental interactions that govern the assembly, stability and evolution of microbial communities. A widely held view is that antagonistic interactions such as competition predominate in microbial communities and are ecologically more important than synergistic interactions-for example, mutualism or commensalism. Over the past decade, however, a more nuanced picture has emerged, wherein bacteria, archaea and fungi exist within interactive networks in which they exchange essential and non-essential metabolites. These metabolic interactions profoundly impact not only the physiology, ecology and evolution of the strains involved, but are also central to the functioning of many, if not all, microbiomes. Therefore, we advocate for a balanced view of microbiome ecology that encompasses both synergistic and antagonistic interactions as key forces driving the structure and dynamics within microbial communities.

_Mice, Humans, Animals, Escherichia coli, Mucositis, Escherichia coli Proteins, Inflammation, Probiotics_
Probiotics have gained attention for their potential maintaining gut and immune homeostasis. They have been found to confer protection against pathogen colonization, possess immunomodulatory effects, enhance gut barrier functionality, and mitigate inflammation. However, a thorough understanding of the unique mechanisms of effects triggered by individual strains is necessary to optimize their therapeutic efficacy. Probiogenomics, involving high-throughput techniques, can help identify uncharacterized strains and aid in the rational selection of new probiotics. This study evaluates the potential of the Escherichia coli CEC15 strain as a probiotic through in silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses, comparing it to the well-known probiotic reference E. coli Nissle 1917. Genomic analysis was conducted to identify traits with potential beneficial activity and to assess the safety of each strain (genomic islands, bacteriocin production, antibiotic resistance, production of proteins involved in host homeostasis, and proteins with adhesive properties). In vitro studies assessed survival in gastrointestinal simulated conditions and adhesion to cultured human intestinal cells. Safety was evaluated in BALB/c mice, monitoring the impact of E. coli consumption on clinical signs, intestinal architecture, intestinal permeability, and fecal microbiota. Additionally, the protective effects of both strains were assessed in a murine model of 5-FU-induced mucositis.

## Evidence for the contribution of the gut microbiome to obesity and its reversal.
 27.11.2023, _DF de Wit, NMJ Hanssen, K Wortelboer, H Herrema, E Rampanelli, M Nieuwdorp_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Obesity, Risk Factors, Probiotics_
Obesity has become a worldwide pandemic affecting more than 650 million people and is associated with a high burden of morbidity. Alongside traditional risk factors for obesity, the gut microbiome has been identified as a potential factor in weight regulation. Although rodent studies suggest a link between the gut microbiome and body weight, human evidence for causality remains scarce. In this Review, we postulate that existing evidence remains to establish a contribution of the gut microbiome to the development of obesity in humans but that modified probiotic strains and supraphysiological dosages of microbial metabolites may be beneficial in combatting obesity.

The use of antibiotics to treat diarrhea and other diseases early in life can lead to intestinal disorders in infants, which can cause a range of immune-related diseases. Intestinal microbiota diversity is closely related to dietary intake, with many oligosaccharides impacting intestinal microorganism structures and communities. Thus, oligosaccharide type and quantity are important for intestinal microbiota construction. Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are functional oligosaccharides that can be supplemented with infant formula. Currently, information on GOS and its impact on intestinal microbiota diversity and disorders is lacking. Similarly, GOS is rarely reported within the context of intestinal barrier function. In this study, 16S rRNA sequencing, gas chromatography, and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the effects of GOS on the intestinal microbiota and barrier pathways in antibiotic-treated mouse models. The results found that GOS promoted Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia proliferation, increased short-chain fatty acid levels, increased tight junction protein expression (occludin and ZO-1), increased secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and albumin levels, significantly downregulated NF-κB expression, and reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-IL-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 levels. Also, a high GOS dose in ampicillin-supplemented animals provided resistance to intestinal damage.

Oral ulcer can be treated with diverse biomaterials loading drugs or cytokines. However, most patients do not benefit from these materials because of poor adhesion, short-time retention in oral cavity and low drug therapeutic efficacy. Here we report a self-stabilized and water-responsive deliverable coenzyme salt polymer poly(sodium α-lipoate) (PolyLA-Na)/coenzyme polymer poly(α-lipoic acid) (PolyLA) binary synergistic elastomer adhesive patch, where hydrogen bonding cross-links between PolyLA and PolyLA-Na prevents PolyLA depolymerization and slow down the dissociation of PolyLA-Na, thus allowing water-responsive sustainable delivery of bioactive LA-based small molecules and durable adhesion to oral mucosal wound due to the adhesive action of PolyLA. In the model of mice and mini-pig oral ulcer, the adhesive patch accelerates the healing of the ulcer by regulating the damaged tissue inflammatory environment, maintaining the stability of oral microbiota, and promoting faster re-epithelialization and angiogenesis. This binary synergistic patch provided a therapeutic strategy to treat oral ulcer.

## A key genetic factor governing arabinan utilization in the gut microbiome alleviates constipation.
 22.11.2023, _C Zhang, L Yu, C Ma, S Jiang, Y Zhang, S Wang, F Tian, Y Xue, J Zhao, H Zhang, L Liu, W Chen, S Huang, J Zhang, Q Zhai_


Impaired gastrointestinal motility is associated with gut dysbiosis. Probiotics, such as Bifidobacteria, can improve this bowel disorder; however, efficacy is strain-dependent. We determine that a genetic factor, the abfA cluster governing arabinan utilization, in Bifidobacterium longum impacts treatment efficacy against functional constipation (FC). In mice with FC, B. longum, but not an abfA mutant, improved gastrointestinal transit time, an affect that was dependent upon dietary arabinan. abfA genes were identified in other commensal bacteria, whose effects in ameliorating murine FC were similarly abfA-dependent. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, supplementation with abfA-cluster-carrying B. longum, but not an abfA-deficient strain, enriched arabinan-utilization residents, increased beneficial metabolites, and improved FC symptoms. Across human cohorts, abfA-cluster abundance can predict FC, and transplantation of abfA cluster-enriched human microbiota to FC-induced germ-free mice improved gut motility. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a role for microbial abfA cluster in ameliorating FC, establishing principles for genomics-directed probiotic therapies.

The positive effects of exposing corals to microorganisms have been reported though how the benefits are conferred are poorly understood. Here, we isolated an actinobacterial strain (SCSIO 13291) from Pocillopora damicornis with capabilities to synthesize antioxidants, vitamins, and antibacterial and antiviral compounds supported with phenotypic and/or genomic evidence. Strain SCSIO 13291 was labeled with 5 (and - 6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester and the labeled cell suspension directly inoculated onto the coral polyp tissues when nubbins were under thermal stress in a mesocosm experiment. We then visualized the labelled bacterial cells and analyzed the coral physiological, transcriptome and microbiome to elucidate the effect this strain conferred on the coral holobiont under thermal stress.

## Symbiodiniaceae photophysiology and stress resilience is enhanced by microbial associations.

Symbiodiniaceae form associations with extra- and intracellular bacterial symbionts, both in culture and in symbiosis with corals. Bacterial associates can regulate Symbiodiniaceae fitness in terms of growth, calcification and photophysiology. However, the influence of these bacteria on interactive stressors, such as temperature and light, which are known to influence Symbiodiniaceae physiology, remains unclear. Here, we examined the photophysiological response of two Symbiodiniaceae species (Symbiodinium microadriaticum and Breviolum minutum) cultured under acute temperature and light stress with specific bacterial partners from their microbiome (Labrenzia (Roseibium) alexandrii, Marinobacter adhaerens or Muricauda aquimarina). Overall, bacterial presence positively impacted Symbiodiniaceae core photosynthetic health (photosystem II [PSII] quantum yield) and photoprotective capacity (non-photochemical quenching; NPQ) compared to cultures with all extracellular bacteria removed, although specific benefits were variable across Symbiodiniaceae genera and growth phase. Symbiodiniaceae co-cultured with M. aquimarina displayed an inverse NPQ response under high temperatures and light, and those with L. alexandrii demonstrated a lowered threshold for induction of NPQ, potentially through the provision of antioxidant compounds such as zeaxanthin (produced by Muricauda spp.) and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP; produced by this strain of L. alexandrii). Our co-culture approach empirically demonstrates the benefits bacteria can deliver to Symbiodiniaceae photochemical performance, providing evidence that bacterial associates can play important functional roles for Symbiodiniaceae.

## Sparsity of higher-order landscape interactions enables learning and prediction for microbiomes.
 27.11.2023, _S Arya, AB George, JP O'Dwyer_


_Humans, Microbiota_
Microbiome engineering offers the potential to leverage microbial communities to improve outcomes in human health, agriculture, and climate. To translate this potential into reality, it is crucial to reliably predict community composition and function. But a brute force approach to cataloging community function is hindered by the combinatorial explosion in the number of ways we can combine microbial species. An alternative is to parameterize microbial community outcomes using simplified, mechanistic models, and then extrapolate these models beyond where we have sampled. But these approaches remain data-hungry, as well as requiring an a priori specification of what kinds of mechanisms are included and which are omitted. Here, we resolve both issues by introducing a mechanism-agnostic approach to predicting microbial community compositions and functions using limited data. The critical step is the identification of a sparse representation of the community landscape. We then leverage this sparsity to predict community compositions and functions, drawing from techniques in compressive sensing. We validate this approach on in silico community data, generated from a theoretical model. By sampling just [Formula: see text]1% of all possible communities, we accurately predict community compositions out of sample. We then demonstrate the real-world application of our approach by applying it to four experimental datasets and showing that we can recover interpretable, accurate predictions on composition and community function from highly limited data.

The intestinal epithelium is constantly exposed to microbes residing in the lumen. Traditionally, the response to microbial interactions has been studied in cell lines derived from cancerous tissues, e.g. Caco-2. It is, however, unclear how the responses in these cancer cell lines reflect the responses of a normal epithelium and whether there might be microbial strain-specific effects. To address these questions, we derived organoids from the small intestine from a cohort of healthy individuals. Culturing intestinal epithelium on a flat laminin matrix induced their differentiation, facilitating analysis of microbial responses via the apical membrane normally exposed to the luminal content. Here, it was evident that the healthy epithelium across multiple individuals (n = 9) demonstrates robust acute both common and strain-specific responses to a range of probiotic bacterial strains (BB-12Ⓡ, LGGⓇ, DSM33361, and Bif195). Importantly, parallel experiments using the Caco-2 cell line provide no acute response. Collectively, we demonstrate that primary epithelial cells maintained as organoids represent a valuable resource for assessing interactions between the epithelium and luminal microbes across individuals, and that these models are likely to contribute to a better understanding of host microbe interactions.
