## Teaching Instructional Technological Change to Medical School Faculty: A COVID-19 Case Study.
 21.10.2020, _MP Cote, EM Donne, BD Hoover, K Thormodson_


Collaboration between several College of Medicine departments, including the library, resulted in a creation of a new service for faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. By combining efforts, support for teaching online became a united effort and much less daunting for faculty, who could consult one group for online teaching support, rather than three or four different entities. The resulting endeavor led to a website FAQ and consulting email address that is accessible to all faculty to provide focused and timely technology and education assistance to faculty.

Oxidative stress is thought to account for aberrant redox homeostasis and contribute to aging and disease. However, more often than not, administration of antioxidants is ineffective, suggesting that our current understanding of the underlying regulatory processes is incomplete. Recent Advances: Similar to reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, reactive sulfur species are now emerging as important signaling molecules, targeting regulatory cysteine redox switches in proteins, affecting gene regulation, ion transport, intermediary metabolism, and mitochondrial function. To rationalize the complexity of chemical interactions of reactive species with themselves and their targets and help define their role in systemic metabolic control, we here introduce a novel integrative concept defined as the reactive species interactome (RSI). The RSI is a primeval multilevel redox regulatory system whose architecture, together with the physicochemical characteristics of its constituents, allows efficient sensing and rapid adaptation to environmental changes and various other stressors to enhance fitness and resilience at the local and whole-organism level.

## The intestinal microbiome, weight, and metabolic changes in women treated by adjuvant chemotherapy for breast and gynecological malignancies.

Adjuvant chemotherapy induces weight gain, glucose intolerance, and hypertension in about a third of women. The mechanisms underlying these events have not been defined. This study assessed the association between the microbiome and weight gain in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast and gynecological cancers.

## Gut microbial molecules in behavioural and neurodegenerative conditions.
 17.10.2020, _BD Needham, R Kaddurah-Daouk, SK Mazmanian_


Mounting evidence suggests that the gut microbiome impacts brain development and function. Gut-brain connections may be mediated by an assortment of microbial molecules that are produced in the gastrointestinal tract, which can subsequently permeate many organs, including sometimes the brain. Studies in animal models have identified molecular cues propagated from intestinal bacteria to the brain that can affect neurological function and/or neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. Herein, we describe bacterial metabolites with known or suspected neuromodulatory activity, define mechanisms of signalling pathways from the gut microbiota to the brain and discuss direct effects that gut bacterial molecules are likely exerting on specific brain cells. Many discoveries are recent, and the findings described in this Perspective are largely novel and yet to be extensively validated. However, expanding research into the dynamic molecular communications between gut microorganisms and the CNS continues to uncover critical and previously unappreciated clues in understanding the pathophysiology of behavioural, psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions between host genetics and gut microbiota determine susceptibility to CNS autoimmunity.
 20.10.2020, _TL Montgomery, A Künstner, JJ Kennedy, Q Fang, L Asarian, R Culp-Hill, A D'Alessandro, C Teuscher, H Busch, DN Krementsov_


Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. The etiology of MS is multifactorial, with disease risk determined by genetics and environmental factors. An emerging risk factor for immune-mediated diseases is an imbalance in the gut microbiome. However, the identity of gut microbes associated with disease risk, their mechanisms of action, and the interactions with host genetics remain obscure. To address these questions, we utilized the principal autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), together with a genetically diverse mouse model representing 29 unique host genotypes, interrogated by microbiome sequencing and targeted microbiome manipulation. We identified specific gut bacteria and their metabolic functions associated with EAE susceptibility, implicating short-chain fatty acid metabolism as a key element conserved across multiple host genotypes. In parallel, we used a reductionist approach focused on two of the most disparate phenotypes identified in our screen. Manipulation of the gut microbiome by transplantation and cohousing demonstrated that transfer of these microbiomes into genetically identical hosts was sufficient to modulate EAE susceptibility and systemic metabolite profiles. Parallel bioinformatic approaches identified Lactobacillus reuteri as a commensal species unexpectedly associated with exacerbation of EAE in a genetically susceptible host, which was functionally confirmed by bacterial isolation and commensal colonization studies. These results reveal complex interactions between host genetics and gut microbiota modulating susceptibility to CNS autoimmunity, providing insights into microbiome-directed strategies aimed at lowering the risk for autoimmune disease and underscoring the need to consider host genetics and baseline gut microbiome composition.
