## Toward Understanding Microbiome-Neuronal Signaling.
 10.04.2020, _KG Jameson, CA Olson, SA Kazmi, EY Hsiao_


Host-associated microbiomes are emerging as important modifiers of brain activity and behavior. Metabolic, immune, and neuronal pathways are proposed to mediate communication across the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, strong mechanistic evidence, especially for direct signaling between microbes and sensory neurons, is lacking. Here, we discuss microbial regulation of short-chain fatty acids, neurotransmitters, as-yet-uncharacterized biochemicals, and derivatives of neuromodulatory drugs as important areas for assessing microbial interactions with the nervous system.

## Gut microbiota in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: characteristics, biomarker identification, and usefulness in clinical prediction.
 12.04.2020, _X Qian, YX Liu, X Ye, W Zheng, S Lv, M Mo, J Lin, W Wang, W Wang, X Zhang, M Lu_


Recent studies have suggested that the gut microbiota is altered in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). However, age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) were not matched in the previous studies, and the results are inconsistent. We conducted an age-, sex-, and BMI-matched cross-sectional study to characterize the gut microbiota in children with JIA, and evaluate its potential in clinical prediction.

## Gut Microbiota Modulate CD8 T Cell Responses to Influence Colitis-Associated Tumorigenesis.

There is increasing evidence that gut microbiome perturbations, also known as dysbiosis, can influence colorectal cancer development. To understand the mechanisms by which the gut microbiome modulates cancer susceptibility, we examine two wild-type mouse colonies with distinct gut microbial communities that develop significantly different tumor numbers using a mouse model of inflammation-associated tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that adaptive immune cells contribute to the different tumor susceptibilities associated with the two microbial communities. Mice that develop more tumors have increased colon lamina propria CD8+ IFNγ+ T cells before tumorigenesis but reduced CD8+ IFNγ+ T cells in tumors and adjacent tissues compared with mice that develop fewer tumors. Notably, intratumoral T cells in mice that develop more tumors exhibit increased exhaustion. Thus, these studies suggest that microbial dysbiosis can contribute to colon tumor susceptibility by hyperstimulating CD8 T cells to promote chronic inflammation and early T cell exhaustion, which can reduce anti-tumor immunity.

## Components of human breast milk: from macronutrient to microbiome and microRNA.
 06.04.2020, _SY Kim, DY Yi_


Human breast milk (HBM) is essential for the infant's growth and development right after birth and is an irreplaceable source of nutrition for early human survival. Various infant formulas have many similarities to HBM in many components, but there is no perfect substitute for HBM. Recently, various breast milk components and their roles have been studied according to the development of various analysis techniques. As is already well known, HBM contains about 87-88% water, and 124 g/L solid components as macronutrients, including about 7% (60-70 g/L) carbohydrates, 1% (8-10 g/L) protein, and 3.8% (35-40 g/L) fat. The composition may vary depending on the environmental factors, including maternal diet. Colostrum is low in fat but high in protein and relatively rich in immune-protective components. Although HBM contains enough vitamins to ensure normal growth of the infant, vitamins D and K may be insufficient, and the infant may require their supplementation. Growth factors in HBM also serve as various bioactive proteins and peptides on the intestinal tract, vasculature, nervous system, and endocrine system. In the past, HBM of a healthy mother was thought to be sterile. However, several subsequent studies have confirmed the presence of rich and diverse microbial communities in HBM. Some studies suggested that the genera Staphylococcus and Streptococcus may be universally predominant in HBM, but the origin of microbiota still remains controversial. Lastly, milk is the one of most abundant body fluid of microRNAs, which are known to play a role in various functions, such as immunoprotection and developmental programming, through delivering from HBM and absorption by intestinal epithelial cells. In conclusion, HBM is the most important source of nutrition for infants and includes microbiomes and miRNAs for growth, development, and immunity.

## Effects of Dietary Microencapsulated Tannic Acid (extracted from Chinese gallnut) Supplementation on the Growth Performance, Intestinal Morphology, and Intestinal Microbiota in Weaning Piglets.
 07.04.2020, _M Wang, H Huang, Y Hu, J Huang, H Yang, L Wang, S Chen, C Chen, S He_


Antibiotics are commonly overused to reduce weaning stress that leads to economic loss in swine production. As potential substitutes of antibiotics, plant extracts have attracted the attention of researchers. However, one of plant extracts, tannic acid (TA) has an adverse effect on the growth performance, palatability, and intestinal absorption in weaning piglets when used at a large amount. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a proper dose of microencapsulated TA on the growth performance, organ and intestinal development, intestinal morphology, intestinal nutrient transporters, and colonic microbiota in weaning piglets. Forty-five Duroc×[Landrace×Yorkshire] (initial body weight=5.99 ± 0.13kg, weaned days=21d) were randomly divided into five treatment groups (n=9) and raised in 14 days. The piglets in the control group (CON) were raised on a basal diet, the piglets in the antibiotic test group were raised on a basal diet with three antibiotics (AB: 375 mg/kg Chlortetracycline 20%, 500 mg/kg Enramycin 4%, 1500 mg/kg Oxytetracycline calcium 20%), and the other three groups were raised on a basal diet with three doses of microencapsulated TA (TA1, 500 mg/kg; TA2, 1000 mg/kg; TA3, 1500 mg/kg). All the piglets were raised in the same environment and given the same amount of nutrients for two weeks. The results showed that both TA1 and TA2 groups had no adverse effect on the growth performance, organ weight and intestinal growth, and the pH value of gastrointestinal content. TA2 treatment improved the duodenal morphology (P &lt; 0.05), increased the gene expression level of solute carrier family 6, member 19 (SLC6A19) and solute carrier family 15, member 1 (SLC15A1) (P &lt; 0.05) in ileum, and modulated the colonic bacteria composition (P &lt; 0.05), but inhibited the activity of maltase in ileum (P &lt; 0.05) and the jejunal gene expression level of solute carrier family 5, member 1 (SLC5A1) (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, our study suggests that a dosage between 500mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg of microencapsulated TA is safe to be included in the swine diet, and that 1000mg/kg of microencapsulated TA has beneficial effects on intestinal morphology, intestinal nutrient transporter and intestinal microbiota in weaning piglets. These findings provide new insights into suitable alternatives to antibiotics for improving growth performance and colonic microbiota.

## An early fecal microbiota transfer improves the intestinal conditions on microflora and immunoglobulin and antimicrobial peptides in piglets.
 07.04.2020, _T Teng, F Gao, W He, H Fu, J Guo, G Bai, B Shi_


The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of early fecal microbial transfer (FMT) on the microflora of recipient piglets, where Yorkshire newborn piglets and Min sows (indigenous pig breed in China) were used as the fecal recipients and donors, respectively, to reveal the changes in immunity and development-related functions of the intestinal mucosa driven by FMT. The recipient group was inoculated with fecal microbial fluids from days 1 to 10. On day 21, the relative abundance of the Proteobacteria was reduced; the concentrations of IgM and IgG in the jejunal mucosa, and that of IgG in the ileal mucosa of the recipient group were increased (P &lt; 0.05). On day 40, the relative abundance of the Firmicutes in the recipient group was increased, while that of Bacteroides was decreased. The concentrations of IgG and IgM in the ileal mucosa of the recipient group were increased. FMT protected the intestine by modulating the antimicrobial peptides of the intestinal mucosa (P &lt; 0.05). The results of this study revealed that early FMT can improve the gut microbiota, intestinal mucosal immunity and intestinal development-related functions of Yorkshire piglets.

## Diversity and potential biogeochemical impacts of viruses in bulk and rhizosphere soils.
 06.04.2020, _L Bi, DT Yu, S Du, LM Zhang, LY Zhang, CF Wu, C Xiong, LL Han, JZ He_


Viruses can affect microbial dynamics, metabolism and biogeochemical cycles in aquatic ecosystems. However, viral diversity and functions in agricultural soils are poorly known, especially in the rhizosphere. We used virome analysis of eight rhizosphere and bulk soils to study viral diversity and potential biogeochemical impacts in an agro-ecosystem. The order Caudovirales was the predominant viral type in agricultural soils, with Siphoviridae being the most abundant family. Phylogenetic analysis of the terminase large subunit of Caudovirales identified high viral diversity and three novel groups. Viral community composition differed significantly between bulk and rhizosphere soils. Soil pH was the main environmental driver of viral community structure. Remarkably, abundant auxiliary carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes were detected in viromes, including glycoside hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases, and carbohydrate-binding modules. These results demonstrate that virus-encoded putative auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) or metabolic genes that may change bacterial metabolism and indirectly contribute to biogeochemical cycling, especially carbon cycling, in agricultural soil.

## Rhizosphere microbiome assemble and its impact on plant growth.
 07.04.2020, _Q Qu, Z Zhang, WJGM Peijnenburg, W Liu, T Lu, B Hu, JM Chen, J Chen, Z Lin, H Qian_


Microorganisms colonizing the plant rhizosphere provide a number of beneficial functions for their host. Although an increasing number of investigations clarified the great functional capabilities of rhizosphere microbial communities, the understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying the impact of rhizosphere microbiome assemblies is still limited. Also, not much is known about the various beneficial functions of the rhizosphere microbiome. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of biotic and abiotic factors that shape the rhizosphere microbiome, as well as the rhizosphere microbiome traits that are beneficial to plants growth and disease-resistance. We give particular emphasis on the impact of plant root metabolites on rhizosphere microbiome assemblies and on how the microbiome contributes to plant growth, yield, and disease-resistance. Finally, we introduce a new perspective and a novel method showing how a synthetic microbial community construction provides an effective approach to unravel the plant-microbes and microbes-microbes interplays. Keywords: Plant, Rhizosphere microbiome, Growth-promotion, Disease-resistance, Synthetic microbial community.

## The biogeography and assembly of microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants in China.
 07.04.2020, _B Zhang, D Ning, JD Van Nostrand, C Sun, Y Yang, J Zhou, X Wen_


Scientific understanding of microbial biogeography and assembly is lacking for activated sludge microbial communities, even though the diversity of microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is thought to have a direct influence on system performance. Here, utilizing large-scale 16S rRNA gene data generated from 211 activated sludge samples collected from 15 cities across China, we show activated sludge microbes, whose growth and metabolism can be regulated followed the metabolic theory of ecology with an apparent Ea value (apparent activation energy) of 0.08 eV. WWTPs at a lower latitude tend to harbor a more diverse array of microorganisms. In agreement with the general understanding, activated sludge microbial assembly was mainly driven by deterministic processes and the mean annual temperature was identified as the most important factor affecting the microbial community structure. The treatment process types with similar microbial growth type and functions had a distinct impact on the activated sludge microbial community structure only when WWTPs were located near each other and received similar influent. Overall, these findings provide us with a deeper understanding of activated sludge microbial communities from an ecological perspective. Moreover, these findings suggest that for a given set of performance characteristics (e.g. combined nitrification, denitrification, and phosphorus removal), it may be difficult to employ common engineering levers to control additional aspects of community structure due to the influence of natural environmental factors.
