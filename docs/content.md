## Outcomes of Transfemoral Carotid Artery Stenting and Transcarotid Artery Revascularization for Restenosis after Prior Ipsilateral Carotid Endarterectomy.
 10.09.2021, _H Chang, CB Rockman, FJ Veith, VS Kashyap, GR Jacobowitz, M Sadek, K Garg, TS Maldonado_


Restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) poses unique therapeutic challenges, with no specific guidelines on operative approach. Traditionally, transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TfCAS) has been regarded as the preferred approach to treating restenosis after CEA. Recently, transcarotid artery revascularization with a flow-reversal neuroprotection system (TCAR) has gained popularity as an effective alternative treatment modality for de novo carotid artery stenosis. The aim of the study is to compare the contemporary perioperative outcomes of TfCAS and TCAR in patients with prior ipsilateral CEA.

## Modified ICH score was superior to original ICH score for assessment of 30-day mortality and good outcome of non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage.
 10.09.2021, _IPE Widyadharma, A Krishna, A Soejitno, AAAP Laksmidewi, K Tini, IBK Putra, IGN Budiarsa, IAS Indrayani_


Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) score has been widely used as a consistent and reliable clinical grading scale for predicting mortality. However, ICH score had not been used to predict good outcome or significant disability for those who were alive. We intended to address whether any modifications would increase prediction accuracy for mortality as well as the extent of morbidity for those who survived.
