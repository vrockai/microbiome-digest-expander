## Review article: how the intestinal microbiota may reflect disease activity and influence therapeutic outcome in inflammatory bowel disease.
 24.09.2020, _C Caenepeel, N Sadat Seyed Tabib, S Vieira-Silva, S Vermeire_


Intestinal bacteria produce metabolites and by-products necessary for homeostasis. Imbalance in this equilibrium is linked with multiple pathologies, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The role of the gut microbiota in determining treatment response is becoming apparent, and may act as biomarker for efficacy.

## Soil origin and plant genotype structure distinct microbiome compartments in the model legume Medicago truncatula.
 29.09.2020, _SP Brown, MA Grillo, JC Podowski, KD Heath_


Understanding the genetic and environmental factors that structure plant microbiomes is necessary for leveraging these interactions to address critical needs in agriculture, conservation, and sustainability. Legumes, which form root nodule symbioses with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, have served as model plants for understanding the genetics and evolution of beneficial plant-microbe interactions for decades, and thus have added value as models of plant-microbiome interactions. Here we use a common garden experiment with 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to study the drivers of microbiome diversity and composition in three genotypes of the model legume Medicago truncatula grown in two native soil communities.

## Fungi and viruses as important players in microbial mats.
 23.09.2020, _C Carreira, C Lønborg, M Kühl, AI Lillebø, RA Sandaa, L Villanueva, S Cruz_


Microbial mats are compacted, surface-associated microbial ecosystems reminiscent of the first living communities on early Earth. While often considered predominantly prokaryotic, recent findings show that both fungi and viruses are ubiquitous in microbial mats, albeit their functional roles remaining unknown. Fungal research has mostly focused on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems where fungi are known as important recyclers of organic matter, whereas viruses are exceptionally abundant and important in aquatic ecosystems. Here viruses have shown to affect organic matter cycling and the diversity of microbial communities by facilitating horizontal gene transfer and cell lysis. We hypothesise fungi and viruses to have similar roles in microbial mats. Based on the author's perspectives, and from the analysis of previous research in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, we outline novel hypotheses proposing strong impacts of fungi and viruses on element cycling, food web structure and function in microbial mats, and outline experimental approaches for studies needed to understand these interactions.

## Addition of Coriander during Fermentation of Korean Soy Sauce (Gangjang) Causes Significant Shift in Microbial Composition and Reduction in Biogenic Amine Levels.
 28.09.2020, _M Mannaa, YS Seo, I Park_


The microflora of Korean soy sauce (gangjang) play an important role in maintaining its quality and safety. Hence, it is important to study the microflora and the possible approaches to improve their composition. In this study, the effect of adding coriander during soy sauce fermentation on the microflora and biogenic amines was evaluated using metagenomics and 1H NMR analyses, respectively. The β-diversity showed a clear distinction between the microbiota of the coriander and control groups. Microbial composition analysis revealed noticeable shifts, as Firmicutes abundance was significantly higher in the coriander group (91.77%) than that in the control (38.78%). The dominant bacterial family in the coriander group was the Bacillaceae (57.94%), while Halomonadaceae was dominant in the control group (49.77%). At the species level, Chromohalobacter beijerinckii dominated the microbial community in the control group (49.54%), but not (4.43%) in the coriander group. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between the Bacillaceae and several other bacterial families, including Halomonadaceae, which indicated a possible antagonism and partly explained the reduction in Chromohalobacter abundance in the coriander group. The levels of the biogenic amines histamine, putrescine, and tyramine, which are considered potential health risk factors, were significantly lower in the coriander soy sauce than those in the control sauce. The results of this study suggest that the addition of coriander during Korean soy sauce fermentation is beneficial, as coriander significantly reduces the levels of biogenic amines and the bacteria that produce them.
