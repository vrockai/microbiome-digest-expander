## Analysis of the microbiome of the Bolivian high-altitude Lake Pastos Grandes.
 04.07.2023, _J Daga-Quisbert, F Ugarte, GK Rajarao, AJA van Maris, J Quillaguamán_


Lake Pastos Grandes in Bolivia is mainly composed of salt flats, which are sporadically and only partially submerged during the wet season. In the present study, the chemical composition of water samples of the lake and some influent rivers was determined. We found that it is likely that the lake was influenced by the dilution of metals from ancient evaporites. We performed the first metagenomic studies on this lake. Analyses on shotgun metagenomics revealed that the relative abundances of Burkholderiales and Pseudomonadales were noteworthy in the water samples, whereas the archaea belonging to the Halobacteriales and Cyanobacteria from subsection III had high abundances in the salt flat. The eukaryotes Crustacea and Diatomea exhibited the highest abundances in the water samples. We investigated further the potential effect of human activities on the nitrogen cycle mobilization in the lake and the propagation of antimicrobial resistance genes. This is the first report about the cycle in the lake. Additionally, rifamycin resistance genes and genes related to efflux pumps, which are not considered a hazard when identified in metagenomes, had the uppermost relative abundances in all sampling points. We found that Lake Pastos Grandes hitherto does not show an appreciable influence by anthropogenic actions.

## A catalog of bacterial reference genomes from cultivated human oral bacteria.

_Humans, Bacteria, Mouth, Saliva, Microbiota, Streptococcus_
The oral cavity harbors highly diverse communities of microorganisms. However, the number of isolated species and high-quality genomes is limited. Here we present a Cultivated Oral Bacteria Genome Reference (COGR), comprising 1089 high-quality genomes based on large-scale aerobic and anaerobic cultivation of human oral bacteria isolated from dental plaques, tongue, and saliva. COGR covers five phyla and contains 195 species-level clusters of which 95 include 315 genomes representing species with no taxonomic annotation. The oral microbiota differs markedly between individuals, with 111 clusters being person-specific. Genes encoding CAZymes are abundant in the genomes of COGR. Members of the Streptococcus genus make up the largest proportion of COGR and many of these harbor entire pathways for quorum sensing important for biofilm formation. Several clusters containing unknown bacteria are enriched in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, emphasizing the importance of culture-based isolation for characterizing and exploiting oral bacteria.

## Gene-based microbiome representation enhances host phenotype classification.
 05.07.2023, _T Deschênes, FWE Tohoundjona, PL Plante, V Di Marzo, F Raymond_


With the concomitant advances in both the microbiome and machine learning fields, the gut microbiome has become of great interest for the potential discovery of biomarkers to be used in the classification of the host health status. Shotgun metagenomics data derived from the human microbiome is composed of a high-dimensional set of microbial features. The use of such complex data for the modeling of host-microbiome interactions remains a challenge as retaining de novo content yields a highly granular set of microbial features. In this study, we compared the prediction performances of machine learning approaches according to different types of data representations derived from shotgun metagenomics. These representations include commonly used taxonomic and functional profiles and the more granular gene cluster approach. For the five case-control datasets used in this study (Type 2 diabetes, obesity, liver cirrhosis, colorectal cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease), gene-based approaches, whether used alone or in combination with reference-based data types, allowed improved or similar classification performances as the taxonomic and functional profiles. In addition, we show that using subsets of gene families from specific functional categories of genes highlight the importance of these functions on the host phenotype. This study demonstrates that both reference-free microbiome representations and curated metagenomic annotations can provide relevant representations for machine learning based on metagenomic data. IMPORTANCE Data representation is an essential part of machine learning performance when using metagenomic data. In this work, we show that different microbiome representations provide varied host phenotype classification performance depending on the dataset. In classification tasks, untargeted microbiome gene content can provide similar or improved classification compared to taxonomical profiling. Feature selection based on biological function also improves classification performance for some pathologies. Function-based feature selection combined with interpretable machine learning algorithms can generate new hypotheses that can potentially be assayed mechanistically. This work thus proposes new approaches to represent microbiome data for machine learning that can potentiate the findings associated with metagenomic data.

## Integrative meta-omics in Galaxy and beyond.

'Omics methods have empowered scientists to tackle the complexity of microbial communities on a scale not attainable before. Individually, omics analyses can provide great insight; while combined as "meta-omics", they enhance the understanding of which organisms occupy specific metabolic niches, how they interact, and how they utilize environmental nutrients. Here we present three integrative meta-omics workflows, developed in Galaxy, for enhanced analysis and integration of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics, combined with our newly developed web-application, ViMO (Visualizer for Meta-Omics) to analyse metabolisms in complex microbial communities.

## Compositional analysis of microbiome data using the linear decomposition model (LDM).
 06.07.2023, _YJ Hu, GA Satten_


There are compelling reasons to test compositional hypotheses about microbiome data. We present here LDM-clr, an extension of our linear decomposition model (LDM) approach to allow fitting linear models to centered-log-ratio-transformed taxa count data. As LDM-clr is implemented within the existing LDM program, it enjoys all the features supported by LDM, including a compositional analysis of differential abundance at both the taxon and community levels, while allowing for a wide range of covariates and study designs for either association or mediation analysis.

## Processing and Storage Methods Affect Oral and Gut Microbiome Composition.
 04.07.2023, _DK Superdock, W Zhang, AC Poole_


Across microbiome studies, fecal and oral samples are stored and processed in different ways, which could affect the observed microbiome composition. Here, we compared treatment methods, which included both storage conditions and processing methods, applied to samples prior to DNA extraction to determine how each affects microbial community diversity as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We collected dental swab, saliva, and fecal samples from 10 individuals, with three technical replicates per treatment method. We assessed four methods of processing fecal samples prior to DNA extraction. We also compared different fractions of frozen saliva and dental samples to fresh samples. We found that lyophilized fecal samples, fresh whole saliva samples, and the supernatant fraction of thawed dental samples retained the highest levels of alpha diversity in samples. The supernatant fraction of thawed saliva samples had the second highest alpha diversity compared to fresh. Then we investigated the differences in microbes between different treatments at the domain and phylum levels as well as identified the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that were significantly different between the methods producing the highest alpha diversity and the other treatment methods. Lyophilized fecal samples had a greater prevalence of Archaea as well as a greater ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes compared to the other treatment methods. Our results provide practical considerations, not only for selection of processing method, but also for comparing results across studies that use these methods. Our findings also indicate differences in treatment method could be a confounding factor influencing the presence, absence, or differential abundance of microbes reported in conflicting studies.
