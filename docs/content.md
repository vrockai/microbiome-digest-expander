Antibiotics (ABX) compromise the efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in cancer patients, but the mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive effects remain unknown. By inducing the down-regulation of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) in the ileum, post-ABX gut recolonization by Enterocloster species drove the emigration of enterotropic α4β7+CD4+ regulatory T 17 cells into the tumor. These deleterious ABX effects were mimicked by oral gavage of Enterocloster species, by genetic deficiency, or by antibody-mediated neutralization of MAdCAM-1 and its receptor, α4β7 integrin. By contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation or interleukin-17A neutralization prevented ABX-induced immunosuppression. In independent lung, kidney, and bladder cancer patient cohorts, low serum levels of soluble MAdCAM-1 had a negative prognostic impact. Thus, the MAdCAM-1-α4β7 axis constitutes an actionable gut immune checkpoint in cancer immunosurveillance.

Introduction. Increasing evidence suggests a correlation between gut microbiota and colorectal cancer (CRC).Hypothesis/Gap Statement. However, few studies have used gut microbiota as a diagnostic biomarker for CRC.Aim. The objective of this study was to explore whether a machine learning (ML) model based on gut microbiota could be used to diagnose CRC and identify key biomarkers in the model.Methodology. We sequenced the 16S rRNA gene from faecal samples of 38 participants, including 17 healthy subjects and 21 CRC patients. Eight supervised ML algorithms were used to diagnose CRC based on faecal microbiota operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and the models were evaluated in terms of identification, calibration and clinical practicality for optimal modelling parameters. Finally, the key gut microbiota was identified using the random forest (RF) algorithm.Results. We found that CRC was associated with the dysregulation of gut microbiota. Through a comprehensive evaluation of supervised ML algorithms, we found that different algorithms had significantly different prediction performance using faecal microbiomes. Different data screening methods played an important role in optimization of the prediction models. We found that naïve Bayes algorithms [NB, accuracy=0.917, area under the curve (AUC)=0.926], RF (accuracy=0.750, AUC=0.926) and logistic regression (LR, accuracy=0.750, AUC=0.889) had high predictive potential for CRC. Furthermore, important features in the model, namely s__metagenome_g__Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group (AUC=0.814), s__Escherichia_coli_g__Escherichia-Shigella (AUC=0.784) and s__unclassified_g__Prevotella (AUC=0.750), could each be used as diagnostic biomarkers of CRC.Conclusions. Our results suggested an association between gut microbiota dysregulation and CRC, and demonstrated the feasibility of the gut microbiota to diagnose cancer. The bacteria s__metagenome_g__Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group, s__Escherichia_coli_g__Escherichia-Shigella and s__unclassified_g__Prevotella were key biomarkers for CRC.

## Outer membrane utilisomes mediate glycan uptake in gut Bacteroidetes.
 07.06.2023, _JBR White, A Silale, M Feasey, T Heunis, Y Zhu, H Zheng, A Gajbhiye, S Firbank, A Baslé, M Trost, DN Bolam, B van den Berg, NA Ranson_


Bacteroidetes are abundant members of the human microbiota, utilizing a myriad of diet- and host-derived glycans in the distal gut1. Glycan uptake across the bacterial outer membrane of these bacteria is mediated by SusCD protein complexes, comprising a membrane-embedded barrel and a lipoprotein lid, which is thought to open and close to facilitate substrate binding and transport. However, surface-exposed glycan-binding proteins and glycoside hydrolases also play critical roles in the capture, processing and transport of large glycan chains. The interactions between these components in the outer membrane are poorly understood, despite being crucial for nutrient acquisition by our colonic microbiota. Here we show that for both the levan and dextran utilization systems of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, the additional outer membrane components assemble on the core SusCD transporter, forming stable glycan-utilizing machines that we term utilisomes. Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy structures in the absence and presence of substrate reveal concerted conformational changes that demonstrate the mechanism of substrate capture, and rationalize the role of each component in the utilisome.

## Skin maturation from birth to 10 years of age: Structure, function, composition and microbiome.
 11.06.2023, _GN Stamatas, PF Roux, E Boireau-Adamezyk, I Lboukili, T Oddos_


Infant and adult skin physiology differ in many ways; however, limited data exist for older children. To further investigate the maturation processes of healthy skin during childhood. Skin parameters were recorded in 80 participants of four age groups: babies (0-2 years), young children (3-6 years), older children (7-&lt;10 years) and adults (25-40 years). Overall, skin barrier function continues to mature, reaching adult levels of transepidermal water loss (TEWL), lipid compactness, stratum corneum (SC) thickness and corneocyte size by the age of about 6 years. Higher levels of lactic acid and lower levels of total amino acids in the SC of babies and young children further indicate higher cell turnover rates. In all age groups, TEWL and skin surface hydration values remain higher on the face compared with the arm. Skin becomes darker and contains higher levels of melanin with increasing age. The composition of skin microbiome of the dorsal forearm in all children groups is distinct from that in adults, with Firmicutes predominating in the former and Proteobacteria in the latter. Skin physiology, along with the skin microbiome, continues to mature during early childhood in a site-specific manner.

## Ecological principles of fecal microbiota transplantation.
 10.06.2023, _F Dini-Andreote, GF Custer_


Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a procedure used to treat diseases related to microbiome imbalances. We discuss how ecological principles can inform the design of FMT clinical trials and contribute to data interpretation. This effort will promote a better understanding of microbiome engraftment and assist the development of clinical protocols.

## Gut bacterial metabolism contributes to host global purine homeostasis.
 06.06.2023, _K Kasahara, RL Kerby, Q Zhang, M Pradhan, M Mehrabian, AJ Lusis, G Bergström, F Bäckhed, FE Rey_


The microbes and microbial pathways that influence host inflammatory disease progression remain largely undefined. Here, we show that variation in atherosclerosis burden is partially driven by gut microbiota and is associated with circulating levels of uric acid (UA) in mice and humans. We identify gut bacterial taxa spanning multiple phyla, including Bacillota, Fusobacteriota, and Pseudomonadota, that use multiple purines, including UA as carbon and energy sources anaerobically. We identify a gene cluster that encodes key steps of anaerobic purine degradation and that is widely distributed among gut-dwelling bacteria. Furthermore, we show that colonization of gnotobiotic mice with purine-degrading bacteria modulates levels of UA and other purines in the gut and systemically. Thus, gut microbes are important drivers of host global purine homeostasis and serum UA levels, and gut bacterial catabolism of purines may represent a mechanism by which gut bacteria influence health.

Observational studies suggest a link between vitamin D and the composition of the gut microbiome, but there is little evidence from randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation. We analyzed data from the D-Health Trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We recruited 21,315 Australians aged 60-84 y and randomized them to 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo monthly for 5 y. Stool samples were collected from a sample of 835 participants (417 in the placebo and 418 in the vitamin D group) approximately 5 y after randomization. We characterized the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We used linear regression to compare alpha diversity indices (i.e. Shannon index (primary outcome), richness, inverse Simpson index), and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes between the two groups. We analyzed between-sample (beta) diversity (i.e. Bray Curtis distance and UniFrac index) using principal coordinate analysis and used PERMANOVA to test for significant clustering according to randomization group. We also assessed the difference in the abundance of the 20 most abundant genera between the two groups using negative binomial regression model with adjustment for multiple testing. Approximately half the participants included in this analysis were women (mean age 69.4 y). Vitamin D supplementation did not alter the Shannon diversity index (mean 3.51 versus 3.52 in the placebo and vitamin D groups, respectively, p = 0.50). Similarly, there was little difference between the groups for other alpha diversity indices, the abundance of different genera, and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio. We did not observe clustering of bacterial communities according to randomization group. In conlusion, monthly doses of 60,000 IU of vitamin D supplementation for 5 y did not alter the composition of the gut microbiome in older Australians.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecological cancer, which remains a threat to female health at all ages. Hypotheses for EOC development include the continuous presence of inflammation, in which microbiota and inflammatory cytokines participate in cancer-related signaling pathway activation. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is prominent for EOC progression, and interacts with inflammation response related to gut microbiota (GM). However, the precise roles of GM during this process are unknown. Here, we showed that the GM from patients with EOC differed from that of healthy women and had GM dysbiosis. We found that EOC modeling may lead to GM changes in mice, and it restored after the administration of GM from healthy controls, while GM from patients with EOC further exacerbated GM dysbiosis. Furthermore, we found that GM from EOC markedly promoted tumor progression and activated Hh signaling; meanwhile, it increased the extent of inflammation and activated NF-κB signaling, but GM from healthy controls improved them. Our results demonstrate how GM dysbiosis promoted EOC progression by activating Hh signaling mediated by TLR4/NF-κB signaling. We anticipate our assay to be a new thought for exploring the role of GM in EOC development. Furthermore, improving GM dysbiosis is a novel therapeutic approach for delaying EOC development.

## Microbes with higher metabolic independence are enriched in human gut microbiomes under stress.

A wide variety of human diseases are associated with loss of microbial diversity in the human gut, inspiring a great interest in the diagnostic or therapeutic potential of the microbiota. However, the ecological forces that drive diversity reduction in disease states remain unclear, rendering it difficult to ascertain the role of the microbiota in disease emergence or severity. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that microbial diversity is diminished as disease states select for microbial populations that are more fit to survive environmental stress caused by inflammation or other host factors. Here, we tested this hypothesis on a large scale, by developing a software framework to quantify the enrichment of microbial metabolisms in complex metagenomes as a function of microbial diversity. We applied this framework to over 400 gut metagenomes from individuals who are healthy or diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We found that high metabolic independence (HMI) is a distinguishing characteristic of microbial communities associated with individuals diagnosed with IBD. A classifier we trained using the normalized copy numbers of 33 HMI-associated metabolic modules not only distinguished states of health versus IBD, but also tracked the recovery of the gut microbiome following antibiotic treatment, suggesting that HMI is a hallmark of microbial communities in stressed gut environments.

## Evolutionary implications of host genetic control for engineering beneficial microbiomes.
 10.06.2023, _LP Henry, J Bergelson_


Engineering new functions in the microbiome requires understanding how host genetic control and microbe-microbe interactions shape the microbiome. One key genetic mechanism underlying host control is the immune system. The immune system can promote stability in the composition of the microbiome by reshaping the ecological dynamics of its members, but the degree of stability will depend on the interplay between ecological context, immune system development, and higher-order microbe-microbe interactions. The eco-evolutionary interplay affecting composition and stability should inform the strategies used to engineer new functions in the microbiome. We conclude with recent methodological developments that provide an important path forward for both engineering new functionality in the microbiome and broadly understanding how ecological interactions shape evolutionary processes in complex biological systems.

## It's all relative: analyzing microbiome compositions, its significance, pathogenesis and microbiota derived biofilms: Challenges and opportunities for disease intervention.
 08.06.2023, _S Zaidi, K Ali, AU Khan_


_Humans, Bacteria, Biofilms, Dysbiosis, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Microbiota, Infant, Newborn_
Concept of microorganisms has largely been perceived from their pathogenic view point. Nevertheless, it is being gradually revisited in terms of its significance to human health and now appears to be the most dominant force that shapes the immune system of the human body and also determines an individual's predisposition to diseases. Human inhabits bacterial diversity (which is predominant among all microbial communities in human body) occupying 0.3% of body mass, known as microbiota. On birth, a part of microbiota that child obtains is essentially a mother's legacy. So, the review was initiated with this critical topic of microbiotal inheritance. Since, each body site has distinct physiological specifications; therefore, they contain discrete microbiome composition that has been separately discussed along with dysbiosis-induced pathologies originating in different body organs. Factors affecting microbiome composition and may cause dysbiosis like antibiotics, delivery, feeding method etc. as well as the strategies that immune system adopts to prevent dysbiosis have been highlighted. We also tried to bring into attention the topic of dysbiosis induced biofilms, that enables cohort to survive stresses, evolve, disseminate and infection resurgence that is still in dormancy. Eventually, we put spotlight on microbiome significance in medical therapeutics. We didn't merely confine article to gut microbiota, that is being studied more extensively. Numerous community forms at diverse body sites are inter-related, and being exposed to awfully variable perturbations appear to be challenging to evaluate perturbation risks holistically. All aspects have been elaborately discussed to achieve a global depiction of human microbiota in order to meet urgent necessity for protocol standardisation. Demonstrates that environmental challenges (antibiotic use, alterations in diet, stress, smoking etc.) might cause dysbiosis i.e. transition of healthy microbiome composition to the one in which pathogenic microorganisms become more abundant, and eventually results in an infected state.
