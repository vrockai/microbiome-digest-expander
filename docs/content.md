## The SAMBA tool uses long reads to improve the contiguity of genome assemblies.
 04.02.2022, _AV Zimin, SL Salzberg_


Third-generation sequencing technologies can generate very long reads with relatively high error rates. The lengths of the reads, which sometimes exceed one million bases, make them invaluable for resolving complex repeats that cannot be assembled using shorter reads. Many high-quality genome assemblies have already been produced, curated, and annotated using the previous generation of sequencing data, and full re-assembly of these genomes with long reads is not always practical or cost-effective. One strategy to upgrade existing assemblies is to generate additional coverage using long-read data, and add that to the previously assembled contigs. SAMBA is a tool that is designed to scaffold and gap-fill existing genome assemblies with additional long-read data, resulting in substantially greater contiguity. SAMBA is the only tool of its kind that also computes and fills in the sequence for all spanned gaps in the scaffolds, yielding much longer contigs. Here we compare SAMBA to several similar tools capable of re-scaffolding assemblies using long-read data, and we show that SAMBA yields better contiguity and introduces fewer errors than competing methods. SAMBA is open-source software that is distributed at https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca.

## 'A landmark in psychiatric progress'? The role of evidence in the rise and fall of insulin coma therapy.
 22.12.2021, _R Freudenthal, J Moncrieff_


This paper examines the evidence behind the use and decline of insulin coma therapy as a treatment for schizophrenia and how this was viewed by the psychiatric profession. The paper demonstrates that, from the time of its introduction, there was considerable debate regarding the evidence for insulin treatment, and scepticism about its purported benefits. The randomized trials conducted in the 1950s were the result, rather than the origins, of this debate. Although insulin treatment was subsequently abandoned, it was still regarded as a historic moment in the modernization of psychiatry. Then, as now, evidence does not speak for itself, and insulin continued to be incorporated into the story of psychiatric progress even after it was shown to be ineffective.

## Dynamic of the human gut microbiome under infectious diarrhea.
 05.02.2022, _H Chung The, SH Le_


Despite the widespread implementation of sanitation, immunization and appropriate treatment, infectious diarrheal diseases still inflict a great health burden to children living in low resource settings. Conventional microbiology research in diarrhea have focused on the pathogen's biology and pathogenesis, but initial enteric infections could trigger subsequent perturbations in the gut microbiome, leading to short-term or long-term health effects. Conversely, such pre-existing perturbations could render children more vulnerable to enteropathogen colonization and diarrhea. Recent advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses have been integrated in well-designed clinical and epidemiological studies, which allow us to track how the gut microbiome changes from disease onset to recovery. Here, we aim to summarize the current understanding on the diarrheal gut microbiome, stratified into different disease stages. Furthermore, we discuss how such perturbations could have impacts beyond an acute diarrhea episode, specifically on the child's nutritional status and the facilitation of antimicrobial resistance.

## Mechanism of Dyspnea during Exercise in Children with Corrected Congenital Heart Disease.
 24.01.2022, _M Chlif, MM Ammar, NB Said, L Sergey, S Ahmaidi, F Alassery, H Hamam_


_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

 05.02.2022, _AM Palmer, RL Tomko, LM Squeglia, KM Gray, MJ Carpenter, TT Smith, J Dahne, BA Toll, EA McClure_


Nicotine vaping among youth has increased, warranting concern from tobacco control proponents. Many youth who vape indicate interest in quitting; however, few empirically supported vaping cessation interventions exist. This pilot feasibility study adapted an established behavioral intervention, contingency management (CM), delivered via telehealth to promote vaping cessation among young adults.

## The adult microbiome of healthy and otitis patients: Definition of the core healthy and diseased ear microbiomes.
 28.01.2022, _M Burton, JA Krumbeck, G Wu, S Tang, A Prem, AK Gupta, TL Dawson_


Otitis media (OM) and externa (OE) are painful, recurrent ear conditions. As most otitis publications focus on the bacterial content of childhood ears, there remains a dearth of information regarding the adult ear microbiome including both bacteria and fungi. This study compares the outer ear microbiome of healthy adults to adults affected by OE and OM using both intergenic-transcribed-spacer (ITS) and 16S-rDNA sequencing. The adult ear core microbiome consists of the prokaryote Cutibacterium acnes and the eukaryotic Malassezia arunalokei, M. globosa, and M. restricta. The healthy ear mycobiome is dominated by Malassezia and can be divided into two groups, one dominated by M. arunalokei, the other by M. restricta. Microbiome diversity and biomass varied significantly between healthy and diseased ears, and analyses reveal the presence of a potential mutualistic, protective effect of Malassezia species and C. acnes. The healthy ear core microbiome includes the bacteria Staphylococcus capitis and S. capitis/caprae, while the diseased ear core is composed of known bacterial and fungal pathogens including Aspergillus sp., Candida sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Corynebacterium jeikeium. The data presented highlight the need for early detection of the cause of otitis to direct more appropriate, efficient treatments. This will improve patient outcomes and promote improved antimicrobial stewardship.

## BIOME-Preserve: A novel storage and transport medium for preserving anaerobic microbiota samples for culture recovery.
 28.01.2022, _ER Hyde, H Lozano, S Cox_


Sequencing-based protocols for studying the human microbiome have unearthed a wealth of information about the relationship between the microbiome and human health. But these microbes cannot be leveraged as therapeutic targets without culture-based studies to phenotype species of interest and to establish culture collections for use in animal models. Traditional sample collection protocols are focused on preserving nucleic acids and metabolites and are largely inappropriate for preserving sensitive anaerobic bacteria for later culture recovery. Here we introduce a novel microbiome preservation kit (BIOME-Preserve) that facilitates recovery of anaerobic bacteria from human stool. Using a combination of culture recovery and shallow whole-genome shotgun sequencing, we characterized the anaerobes cultured from fresh human stool and from human stool held at room temperature in BIOME-Preserve for up to 120 hours. We recovered several species of interest to microbiome researchers, including Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Blautia spp., Eubacterium halii (now Anaerobutyricum hallii), Akkermansia muciniphila, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. We also demonstrated that freezing at -80°C did not adversely affect our ability to culture organisms from BIOME-Preserve, suggesting that it is appropriate both as a transport medium and as a medium for longer-term ultra-cold storage. Together, our results suggest BIOME-Preserve is practical for the collection, transport, and culture of anaerobic bacteria from human samples and can help enable researchers to better understand the link between the microbiome and human health and how to leverage that link through novel microbiome-based therapeutics.

## Multimodal interactions of drugs, natural compounds and pollutants with the gut microbiota.
 01.02.2022, _AE Lindell, M Zimmermann-Kogadeeva, KR Patil_


The gut microbiota contributes to diverse aspects of host physiology, ranging from immunomodulation to drug metabolism. Changes in the gut microbiota composition are associated with various diseases as well as with the response to medications. It is therefore important to understand how different lifestyle and environmental factors shape gut microbiota composition. Beyond the commonly considered factor of diet, small-molecule drugs have recently been identified as major effectors of the microbiota composition. Other xenobiotics, such as environmental or chemical pollutants, can also impact gut bacterial communities. Here, we review the mechanisms of interactions between gut bacteria and antibiotics, host-targeted drugs, natural food compounds, food additives and environmental pollutants. While xenobiotics can impact bacterial growth and metabolism, bacteria in turn can bioaccumulate or chemically modify these compounds. These reciprocal interactions can manifest in complex xenobiotic-microbiota-host relationships. Our Review highlights the need to study mechanisms underlying interactions with pollutants and food additives towards deciphering the dynamics and evolution of the gut microbiota.

## Gut microbiome and health: mechanistic insights.
 02.02.2022, _WM de Vos, H Tilg, M Van Hul, PD Cani_


The gut microbiota is now considered as one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of host health. Virtually all our body sites are colonised by microbes suggesting different types of crosstalk with our organs. Because of the development of molecular tools and techniques (ie, metagenomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, metatranscriptomic), the complex interactions occurring between the host and the different microorganisms are progressively being deciphered. Nowadays, gut microbiota deviations are linked with many diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, intestinal bowel diseases (IBDs) and several types of cancer. Thus, suggesting that various pathways involved in immunity, energy, lipid and glucose metabolism are affected.In this review, specific attention is given to provide a critical evaluation of the current understanding in this field. Numerous molecular mechanisms explaining how gut bacteria might be causally linked with the protection or the onset of diseases are discussed. We examine well-established metabolites (ie, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide) and extend this to more recently identified molecular actors (ie, endocannabinoids, bioactive lipids, phenolic-derived compounds, advanced glycation end products and enterosynes) and their specific receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and gamma (PPARγ), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and G protein-coupled receptors (ie, GPR41, GPR43, GPR119, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5).Altogether, understanding the complexity and the molecular aspects linking gut microbes to health will help to set the basis for novel therapies that are already being developed.

## Phylogenetic analysis and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of uropathogens.
 01.02.2022, _H Ullah, K Bashir, M Idrees, A Ullah, N Hassan, S Khan, B Nasir, T Nadeem, H Ahsan, MI Khan, Q Ali, S Muhammad, M Afzal_


The uropathogens is the main cause of urinary tract infection (UTI). The aim of the study was to isolate bacteria from urine samples of UTI patients and find out the susceptibility of isolated bacteria. Bacteria were identified using both conventional and molecular methods. Sanger sequence procedure used for 16S ribosomal RNA and phylogenetic analysis was performed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA-7) software. In this study, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus were reported as 58, 28 and 14.0% respectively. Phylogenetic tree revealed that 99% of sample No. Ai (05) is closely related to E. coli to (NR 114042.1 E. coli strain NBRC 102203). Aii (23) is 99% similar to K. pneumoniae to (NR 117686.1 K. pneumonia strain DSM 30104) and 90% Bi (48) is closely linked to S. aureus to (NR 113956.1 S. aureus strain NBRC 100910). The antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli recorded highest resistance towards ampicillin (90%) and least resistant to ofloxacin (14%). Some of the other antibiotics such amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and nitrofurantoin resistance were observed 86, 62, 24, 55, 48 and 35% respectively. The cefuroxime showed the highest antibiotic resistance against K. pneumoniae with 85% followed by amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, ampicillin and nitrofurantoin resulted in 60, 45, 67, 70, 75 and 30% respectively. The resistance of S. aureus against erythromycin, cefuroxime and ampicillin were found with 72%. The resistance against amoxicillin, gentamicin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone found 57, 43, 43 and 15% respectively. Phylogenetic analysis shows that sequences are closely related with the reference sequences and E. coli is the dominant bacteria among UTI patients and is resistant to the commercially available antibiotics.

## Ecology and potential functions of plant-associated microbial communities in cold environments.
 27.01.2022, _M Marian, G Licciardello, B Vicelli, I Pertot, M Perazzolli_


_Bacteria, Ecology, Fungi, Microbiota, Plants_
Complex microbial communities are associated with plants and can improve their resilience under harsh environmental conditions. In particular, plants and their associated communities have developed complex adaptation strategies against cold stress. Although changes in plant-associated microbial community structure have been analysed in different cold regions, scarce information is available on possible common taxonomic and functional features of microbial communities across cold environments. In this review, we discuss recent advances in taxonomic and functional characterization of plant-associated microbial communities in three main cold regions, such as alpine, Arctic and Antarctica environments. Culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches are analysed, in order to highlight the main factors affecting the taxonomic structure of plant-associated communities in cold environments. Moreover, biotechnological applications of plant-associated microorganisms from cold environments are proposed for agriculture, industry and medicine, according to biological functions and cold adaptation strategies of bacteria and fungi. Although further functional studies may improve our knowledge, the existing literature suggest that plants growing in cold environments harbor complex, host-specific and cold-adapted microbial communities, which may play key functional roles in plant growth and survival under cold conditions.

## Standardized universal pulse: A fast RF calibration approach to improve flip angle accuracy in parallel transmission.
 05.02.2022, _C Le Ster, F Mauconduit, A Massire, N Boulant, V Gras_


In parallel transmission (pTX), subject-tailored RF pulses allow achieving excellent flip angle (FA) accuracy but often require computationally extensive online optimizations, precise characterization of the static field ( Δ B 0   ), and the transmit RF field ( B 1 +  ) distributions. This costs time and requires expertise from the MR user. Universal pulses (UPs) have been proposed to reduce this burden, yet, with a penalty in FA accuracy. This study introduces the concept of standardized universal pulses (SUPs), where pulses are designed offline and adjusted to the subject through a fast online calibration scan.

## Somatic PMK-1/p38 signaling links environmental stress to germ cell apoptosis and heritable euploidy.
 05.02.2022, _N Soltanmohammadi, S Wang, B Schumacher_


Inheritance of stable and euploid genomes is a prerequisite for species maintenance. The DNA damage response in germ cells controls the integrity of heritable genomes. Whether and how somatic stress responses impact the quality control of germline genomes has remained unclear. Here, we show that PMK-1/p38-mediated stress signaling in intestinal cells is required for germ cell apoptosis amid ionizing radiation (IR)-induced or meiotic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in C. elegans. We demonstrate that intestinal PMK-1/p38 signaling regulates the germ cell death in response to environmental stress. The PMK-1/p38 target SYSM-1 is secreted from the intestine into the germline to trigger apoptosis of meiotic pachytene cells. Compromised PMK-1/p38 signaling in intestinal cells leads to stress-induced aneuploidy in the consequent generation. Our data suggest that somatic stress surveillance controls heritable genome integrity and euploidy.

## Gut microbiome of the largest living rodent harbors unprecedented enzymatic systems to degrade plant polysaccharides.

The largest living rodent, capybara, can efficiently depolymerize and utilize lignocellulosic biomass through microbial symbiotic mechanisms yet elusive. Herein, we elucidate the microbial community composition, enzymatic systems and metabolic pathways involved in the conversion of dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids, a main energy source for the host. In this microbiota, the unconventional enzymatic machinery from Fibrobacteres seems to drive cellulose degradation, whereas a diverse set of carbohydrate-active enzymes from Bacteroidetes, organized in polysaccharide utilization loci, are accounted to tackle complex hemicelluloses typically found in gramineous and aquatic plants. Exploring the genetic potential of this community, we discover a glycoside hydrolase family of β-galactosidases (named as GH173), and a carbohydrate-binding module family (named as CBM89) involved in xylan binding that establishes an unprecedented three-dimensional fold among associated modules to carbohydrate-active enzymes. Together, these results demonstrate how the capybara gut microbiota orchestrates the depolymerization and utilization of plant fibers, representing an untapped reservoir of enzymatic mechanisms to overcome the lignocellulose recalcitrance, a central challenge toward a sustainable and bio-based economy.

## Pesticide-induced disturbances of bee gut microbiotas.
 02.02.2022, _MZ Hotchkiss, AJ Poulain, JRK Forrest_


Social bee gut microbiotas play key roles in host health and performance. Worryingly, a growing body of literature shows that pesticide exposure can disturb these microbiotas. Most studies examine changes in taxonomic composition in Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) gut microbiotas caused by insecticide exposure. Core bee gut microbiota taxa shift in abundance after exposure but are rarely eliminated, with declines in Bifidobacteriales and Lactobacillus near melliventris abundance being the most common shifts. Pesticide concentration, exposure duration, season and concurrent stressors all influence whether and how bee gut microbiotas are disturbed. Also, the mechanism of disturbance-i.e. whether a pesticide directly affects microbial growth or indirectly affects the microbiota by altering host health-likely affects disturbance consistency. Despite growing interest in this topic, important questions remain unanswered. Specifically, metabolic shifts in bee gut microbiotas remain largely uninvestigated, as do effects of pesticide-disturbed gut microbiotas on bee host performance. Furthermore, few bee species have been studied other than A. mellifera, and few herbicides and fungicides have been examined. We call for these knowledge gaps to be addressed so that we may obtain a comprehensive picture of how pesticides alter bee gut microbiotas, and of the functional consequences of these changes.

## Gut microbiota and butyrate contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in premenopause due to estrogen deficiency.
 05.02.2022, _L Liu, Q Fu, T Li, K Shao, X Zhu, Y Cong, X Zhao_


The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in postmenopausal women has increased significantly. Estrogen plays a very important role in NAFLD, but whether NAFLD in premenopausal women was caused by estrogen deficiency was unknown. Thus, it is of great clinical significance to explore the mechanism of NAFLD in premenopausal women. Gut microbiota and its metabolites short chain fatty acids (SCFA) have been shown to play important roles in the development of NAFLD. In this study, we investigated the impact of gut microbiota and SCFA in NAFLD patients and mice caused by estrogen deficiency. We showed that premenopause NAFLD patients had much lower estrogen levels. Estrogen deficient mice, due to ovariectomy (OVX), suffered more severe liver steatosis with an elevated body weight, abdominal fat weight, serum triglycerides and deterioration in hepatic steatosis. Altered gut microbiota composition and decreased butyrate content were found in NAFLD patients and in OVX mice. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or supplementing with butyrate alleviated NAFLD in OVX mice. The production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) Reg3ɣ, β-defensins and the expression of intestinal epithelial tight junction, including ZO-1 and Occluding-5, were decreased in the OVX mice compared to control mice. Upregulation of PPAR-ɣ and VLDLR, downregulation of PPAR-ɑ indicated that OVX mice suffered from abnormal lipid metabolism. These data indicate that changes in the gut microbiota and SCFA caused by estrogen reduction, together with a disorder in AMP production and lipid metabolism, promote NAFLD, thus provide SCFAs derived from microbiota as new therapeutic targets for the clinical prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

## BIOME-Preserve: A novel storage and transport medium for preserving anaerobic microbiota samples for culture recovery.
 28.01.2022, _ER Hyde, H Lozano, S Cox_


Sequencing-based protocols for studying the human microbiome have unearthed a wealth of information about the relationship between the microbiome and human health. But these microbes cannot be leveraged as therapeutic targets without culture-based studies to phenotype species of interest and to establish culture collections for use in animal models. Traditional sample collection protocols are focused on preserving nucleic acids and metabolites and are largely inappropriate for preserving sensitive anaerobic bacteria for later culture recovery. Here we introduce a novel microbiome preservation kit (BIOME-Preserve) that facilitates recovery of anaerobic bacteria from human stool. Using a combination of culture recovery and shallow whole-genome shotgun sequencing, we characterized the anaerobes cultured from fresh human stool and from human stool held at room temperature in BIOME-Preserve for up to 120 hours. We recovered several species of interest to microbiome researchers, including Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Blautia spp., Eubacterium halii (now Anaerobutyricum hallii), Akkermansia muciniphila, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. We also demonstrated that freezing at -80°C did not adversely affect our ability to culture organisms from BIOME-Preserve, suggesting that it is appropriate both as a transport medium and as a medium for longer-term ultra-cold storage. Together, our results suggest BIOME-Preserve is practical for the collection, transport, and culture of anaerobic bacteria from human samples and can help enable researchers to better understand the link between the microbiome and human health and how to leverage that link through novel microbiome-based therapeutics.

## Species-targeted sorting and cultivation of commensal bacteria from the gut microbiome using flow cytometry under anaerobic conditions.
 04.02.2022, _S Bellais, M Nehlich, M Ania, A Duquenoy, W Mazier, G van den Engh, J Baijer, NS Treichel, T Clavel, I Belotserkovsky, V Thomas_


There is a growing interest in using gut commensal bacteria as "next generation" probiotics. However, this approach is still hampered by the fact that there are few or no strains available for specific species that are difficult to cultivate. Our objective was to adapt flow cytometry and cell sorting to be able to detect, separate, isolate, and cultivate new strains of commensal species from fecal material. We focused on the extremely oxygen sensitive (EOS) species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the under-represented, health-associated keystone species Christensenella minuta as proof-of-concept.

## Panoramic Insights into Microevolution and Macroevolution of Prevotella copri-containing Lineage in Primate Guts.
 05.02.2022, _H Li, JP Meier-Kolthoff, C Hu, Z Wang, J Zhu, W Zheng, Y Tian, F Guo_


Prevotella copri and related taxa are widely detected in mammalian gut microbiomes and have been linked with an enterotype in humans. However, their microevolution and macroevolution among hosts are poorly characterized. In this study, extensively collected marker genes and genomes were analyzed to trace their evolutionary history, host specificity, and biogeographic distribution. Investigations based on marker genes and genomes suggest that a P. copri-containing lineage (PCL) harbors diverse species in higher primates. Firstly, P. copri in the human gut consists of multiple groups exhibiting high genomic divergence and conspicuous but non-strict biogeographic patterns. Most African strains with high genomic divergence from other strains were phylogenetically located at the root of the species, indicating the co-evolutionary history of P. copri and Homo sapiens. Secondly, although long-term co-evolution between PCL and higher primates was revealed, sporadic signals of co-speciation and extensive host jumping of PCL members were suggested among higher primates. Metagenomic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that P. copri and other PCL species found in domesticated mammals had been recently transmitted from humans. Thirdly, strong evidence was found on the extensively horizontal transfer of genes (e.g., genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes) among sympatric P. copri groups and PCL species in the same primate host. Our study provides panoramic insights into the combined effects of vertical and horizontal transmission, and potential niche adaption on speciation, host, and biogeographical distribution spanning microevolutionary and macroevolutionary history for an enterotype-representative lineage.

## The roles of recombination and selection in shaping genomic divergence in an incipient ecological species complex.
 04.02.2022, _MJ Wersebe, RE Sherman, PD Jeyasingh, LJ Weider_


Speciation genomic studies have revealed that genomes of diverging lineages are shaped jointly by the actions of gene flow and selection. These evolutionary forces acting in concert with processes such as recombination and genome features such as gene density shape a mosaic landscape of divergence. We investigated the roles of recombination and gene density in shaping the patterns of differentiation and divergence between the cyclically parthenogenetic ecological sister-taxa, Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia pulex. First, we assembled a phased chromosome-scale genome assembly using trio-binning for D. pulicaria and constructed a genetic map using an F2-intercross panel to understand sex-specific recombination rate heterogeneity. Finally, we used a ddRADseq dataset with broad geographic sampling of D. pulicaria, D. pulex, and their hybrids to understand the patterns of genome-scale divergence and demographic parameters. Our study provides the first sex-specific estimates of recombination rates for a cyclical parthenogen, and unlike other eukaryotic species, we observed male-biased heterochiasmy in D. pulicaria, which may be related to this somewhat unique breeding mode. Additionally, regions of high gene density and recombination are generally more divergent than regions of suppressed recombination. Outlier analysis indicated that divergent genomic regions are likely driven by selection on D. pulicaria, the derived lineage colonizing a novel lake habitat. Together, our study supports a scenario of selection acting on genes related to local adaptation shaping genome-wide patterns of differentiation despite high local recombination rates in this species complex. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our data in light of demographic uncertainty.

## McComedy: A user-friendly tool for next-generation individual-based modeling of microbial consumer-resource systems.
 24.01.2022, _A Bogdanowski, K Frank, T Banitz, LK Muhsal, C Kost_


Individual-based modeling is widely applied to investigate the ecological mechanisms driving microbial community dynamics. In such models, the population or community dynamics emerge from the behavior and interplay of individual entities, which are simulated according to a predefined set of rules. If the rules that govern the behavior of individuals are based on generic and mechanistically sound principles, the models are referred to as next-generation individual-based models. These models perform particularly well in recapitulating actual ecological dynamics. However, implementation of such models is time-consuming and requires proficiency in programming or in using specific software, which likely hinders a broader application of this powerful method. Here we present McComedy, a modeling tool designed to facilitate the development of next-generation individual-based models of microbial consumer-resource systems. This tool allows flexibly combining pre-implemented building blocks that represent physical and biological processes. The ability of McComedy to capture the essential dynamics of microbial consumer-resource systems is demonstrated by reproducing and furthermore adding to the results of two distinct studies from the literature. With this article, we provide a versatile tool for developing next-generation individual-based models that can foster understanding of microbial ecology in both research and education.
