Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a novel concept proposed in 2020, which is more practical for identifying patients with fatty liver disease with high risk of disease progression. Fatty liver is a driver for extrahepatic complications, particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although the risk of CVD in MAFLD could be predicted by carotid ultrasound test, a very early stage prediction method before the formation of pathological damage is still lacking.

## Gut bacteria-driven homovanillic acid alleviates depression by modulating synaptic integrity.
 06.04.2024, _M Zhao, Z Ren, A Zhao, Y Tang, J Kuang, M Li, T Chen, S Wang, J Wang, H Zhang, J Wang, T Zhang, J Zeng, X Liu, G Xie, P Liu, N Sun, T Bao, T Nie, J Lin, P Liu, Y Zheng, X Zheng, T Liu, W Jia_


The gut-brain axis is implicated in depression development, yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. We observed depleted gut bacterial species, including Bifidobacterium longum and Roseburia intestinalis, and the neurotransmitter homovanillic acid (HVA) in individuals with depression and mouse depression models. Although R. intestinalis does not directly produce HVA, it enhances B. longum abundance, leading to HVA generation. This highlights a synergistic interaction among gut microbiota in regulating intestinal neurotransmitter production. Administering HVA, B. longum, or R. intestinalis to mouse models with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression significantly improved depressive symptoms. Mechanistically, HVA inhibited synaptic autophagic death by preventing excessive degradation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and SQSTM1/p62 proteins, protecting hippocampal neurons' presynaptic membrane. These findings underscore the role of the gut microbial metabolism in modulating synaptic integrity and provide insights into potential novel treatment strategies for depression.

## Stress-induced mucin 13 reductions drive intestinal microbiome shifts and despair behaviors.
 05.04.2024, _CR Rivet-Noor, AR Merchak, C Render, NM Gay, RM Beiter, R Brown, A Keeler, G Brett Moreau, S Li, DG Olgun, AD Steigmeyer, R Ofer, T Mihn Huu Phan, K Vemuri, L Chen, KE Mahoney, JB Shin, SA Malaker, C Deppmann, M Verzi, A Gaultier_


Depression is a prevalent psychological condition with limited treatment options. While its etiology is multifactorial, both chronic stress and changes in microbiome composition are associated with disease pathology. Stress is known to induce microbiome dysbiosis, defined here as a change in microbial composition associated with a pathological condition. This state of dysbiosis is known to feedback on depressive symptoms. While studies have demonstrated that targeted restoration of the microbiome can alleviate depressive-like symptoms in mice, translating these findings to human patients has proven challenging due to the complexity of the human microbiome. As such, there is an urgent need to identify factors upstream of microbial dysbiosis. Here we investigate the role of mucin 13 as an upstream mediator of microbiome composition changes in the context of stress. Using a model of chronic stress, we show that the glycocalyx protein, mucin 13, is selectively reduced after psychological stress exposure. We further demonstrate that the reduction of Muc13 is mediated by the Hnf4 transcription factor family. Finally, we determine that deleting Muc13 is sufficient to drive microbiome shifts and despair behaviors. These findings shed light on the mechanisms behind stress-induced microbial changes and reveal a novel regulator of mucin 13 expression.

## Deciphering the impact of cold-adapted bioinoculants on rhizosphere dynamics, biofortification, and yield of kidney bean across varied altitudinal zones.

Agriculture stands as a thriving enterprise in India, serving as both the bedrock of economy and vital source of nutrition. In response to the escalating demands for high-quality food for swiftly expanding population, agricultural endeavors are extending their reach into the elevated terrains of the Himalayas, tapping into abundant resources for bolstering food production. Nonetheless, these Himalayan agro-ecosystems encounter persistent challenges, leading to crop losses. These challenges stem from a combination of factors including prevailing frigid temperatures, suboptimal farming practices, unpredictable climatic shifts, subdivided land ownership, and limited resources. While the utilization of chemical fertilizers has been embraced to enhance the quality of food output, genuine concerns have arisen due to the potential hazards they pose. Consequently, the present investigation was initiated with the objective of formulating environmentally friendly and cold-tolerant broad ranged bioinoculants tailored to enhance the production of Kidney bean while concurrently enriching its nutrient content across entire hilly regions. The outcomes of this study unveiled noteworthy advancements in kidney bean yield, registering a substantial increase ranging from 12.51 ± 2.39 % to 14.15 ± 0.83 % in regions of lower elevation (Jeolikote) and an even more remarkable surge ranging from 20.60 ± 3.03 % to 29.97 ± 5.02 % in higher elevated areas (Chakrata) compared to the control group. Furthermore, these cold-tolerant bioinoculants exhibited a dual advantage by fostering the enhancement of essential nutrients within the grains and fostering a positive influence on the diversity and abundance of microbial life in the rhizosphere. As a result, to effectively tackle the issues associated with chemical fertilizers and to achieve sustainable improvements in both the yield and nutrient composition of kidney bean across varying elevations, the adoption of cold-tolerant Enterobacter hormaechei CHM16, and Pantoea agglomerans HRM 23, including the consortium, presents a promising avenue. Additionally, this study has contributed significant insights-into the role of organic acids like oxalic acid in the solubilization of nutrients, thereby expanding the existing knowledge in this specialized field.

## Analysis of microbial dynamics in the soybean root-associated environments from community to single-cell levels.
 03.04.2024, _M Kifushi, Y Nishikawa, M Hosokawa, K Ide, M Kogawa, T Anai, H Takeyama_


Plant root-associated environments such as the rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and endosphere, are notably different from non-root-associated soil environments. However, the microbial dynamics in these spatially divided compartments remain unexplored. In this study, we propose a combinational analysis of single-cell genomics with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This method enabled us to understand the entire soil microbiome and individual root-associated microorganisms. We applied this method to soybean microbiomes and revealed that their composition was different between the rhizoplane and rhizosphere in the early growth stages, but became more similar as growth progressed. In addition, a total of 610 medium- to high-quality single-amplified genomes (SAGs) were acquired, including plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) candidates while genomes with high GC content tended to be missed by SAGs. The whole-genome analyses of the SAGs suggested that rhizoplane-enriched Flavobacterium solubilizes organophosphate actively and Bacillus colonizes roots more efficiently. Single-cell genomics, together with 16S rRNA gene sequencing, enabled us to connect microbial taxonomy and function, and assess microorganisms at a strain resolution even in the complex soil microbiome.

## phylaGAN: Data augmentation through conditional GANs and autoencoders for improving disease prediction accuracy using microbiome data.
 03.04.2024, _D Sharma, W Lou, W Xu_


Research is improving our understanding of how the microbiome interacts with the human body and its impact on human health. Existing machine learning methods have shown great potential in discriminating healthy from diseased microbiome states. However, Machine Learning based prediction using microbiome data has challenges such as, small sample size, imbalance between cases and controls and high cost of collecting large number of samples. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning framework phylaGAN to augment the existing datasets with generated microbiome data using a combination of conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) and autoencoder. Conditional generative adversarial networks train two models against each other to compute larger simulated datasets that are representative of the original dataset. Autoencoder maps the original and the generated samples onto a common subspace to make the prediction more accurate.
