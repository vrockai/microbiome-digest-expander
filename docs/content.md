## Gastrointestinal and brain barriers: unlocking gates of communication across the microbiota-gut-brain axis.
 14.02.2024, _MR Aburto, JF Cryan_


Crosstalk between gut and brain has long been appreciated in health and disease, and the gut microbiota is a key player in communication between these two distant organs. Yet, the mechanisms through which the microbiota influences development and function of the gut-brain axis remain largely unknown. Barriers present in the gut and brain are specialized cellular interfaces that maintain strict homeostasis of different compartments across this axis. These barriers include the gut epithelial barrier, the blood-brain barrier and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Barriers are ideally positioned to receive and communicate gut microbial signals constituting a gateway for gut-microbiota-brain communication. In this Review, we focus on how modulation of these barriers by the gut microbiota can constitute an important channel of communication across the gut-brain axis. Moreover, barrier malfunction upon alterations in gut microbial composition could form the basis of various conditions, including often comorbid neurological and gastrointestinal disorders. Thus, we should focus on unravelling the molecular and cellular basis of this communication and move from simplistic framing as 'leaky gut'. A mechanistic understanding of gut microbiota modulation of barriers, especially during critical windows of development, could be key to understanding the aetiology of gastrointestinal and neurological disorders.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe neonatal disease with progressive intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts inflammation and hepatic fibrosis. Characterization of gut microbiome profiles in infants with biliary atresia can provide valuable information and potential disease biomarkers. Our study aims to explore the relationship between gut microbiota and biliary atresia.

## Herptile gut microbiomes: a natural system to study multi-kingdom interactions between filamentous fungi and bacteria.

Reptiles and amphibians (herptiles) are some of the most endangered and threatened species on the planet and numerous conservation strategies are being implemented with the goal of ensuring species recovery. Little is known, however, about the gut microbiome of wild herptiles and how it relates to the health of these populations. Here, we report results from the gut microbiome characterization of both a broad survey of herptiles, and the correlation between the fungus Basidiobolus, and the bacterial community supported by a deeper, more intensive sampling of Plethodon glutinosus, known as slimy salamanders. We demonstrate that bacterial communities sampled from frogs, lizards, and salamanders are structured by the host taxonomy and that Basidiobolus is a common and natural component of these wild gut microbiomes. Intensive sampling of multiple hosts across the ecoregions of Tennessee revealed that geography and host:geography interactions are strong predictors of distinct Basidiobolus operational taxonomic units present within a given host. Co-occurrence analyses of Basidiobolus and bacterial community diversity support a correlation and interaction between Basidiobolus and bacteria, suggesting that Basidiobolus may play a role in structuring the bacterial community. We further the hypothesis that this interaction is advanced by unique specialized metabolism originating from horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to Basidiobolus and demonstrate that Basidiobolus is capable of producing a diversity of specialized metabolites including small cyclic peptides.IMPORTANCEThis work significantly advances our understanding of biodiversity and microbial interactions in herptile microbiomes, the role that fungi play as a structural and functional members of herptile gut microbiomes, and the chemical functions that structure microbiome phenotypes. We also provide an important observational system of how the gut microbiome represents a unique environment that selects for novel metabolic functions through horizontal gene transfer between fungi and bacteria. Such studies are needed to better understand the complexity of gut microbiomes in nature and will inform conservation strategies for threatened species of herpetofauna.

## Neuroprotective Effect of a Multistrain Probiotic Mixture in SOD1G93A Mice by Reducing SOD1 Aggregation and Targeting the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.
 13.02.2024, _Z Xin, C Xin, J Huo, Q Liu, H Dong, R Li, Y Liu_


Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons. A bidirectional communication system known as the "microbiota-gut-brain" axis has a regulatory function in neurodegenerative disorders. The impact of probiotics on ALS through the "microbiota-gut-brain" axis remains uncertain. A longitudinal investigation was conducted to examine the alterations in the structure of the ileum and colon in mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1G93A) transgenic mice models of ALS by using immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Subsequently, the mice were administered a multistrain probiotic mixture (LBE) or vehicle orally, starting from 60 days of age until the terminal stage of the disease. The effects of these agents on the behavior, gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, and pathological processes of the spinal and intestine of SOD1G93A mice were analyzed, with a focus on exploring potential protective mechanisms. SOD1G93A mice exhibit various structural abnormalities in the intestine. Oral administration of LBE improved the proinflammatory response, reduced aberrant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) aggregation, and protected neuronal cells in the intestine and spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice. Furthermore, LBE treatment resulted in a change in intestinal microbiota, an increase in short-chain fatty acid levels, and an enhancement in autophagy flux. SOD1G93A mice exhibited various structural abnormalities in the intestine. LBE can improve the proinflammatory response, reduce aberrant SOD1 aggregation, and protect neuronal cells in the spinal cord and intestine of SOD1G93A mice. The positive effect of LBE can be attributed to increased short-chain fatty acids and enhanced autophagy flux.
