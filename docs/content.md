## Targeting the Gut Microbiome to Mitigate Immunotherapy-Induced Colitis in Cancer.
 20.03.2021, _AE Chang, JL Golob, TM Schmidt, DC Peltier, CD Lao, M Tewari_


Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been a transformational advance in cancer therapy in the past decade. However, ICIs can produce immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), which can lead to both morbidity and premature termination of therapy. Recent studies suggest that the gut microbiota and its metabolites affect ICI efficacy and toxicity. Herein, we review such evidence in the context of ICI-induced colitis. In particular, the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, a microbial metabolite, has known protective effects on the intestine. We discuss how the use of dietary prebiotics, which can be metabolized by bacteria to produce butyrate, can be an intriguing new investigational approach to prevent ICI-associated colitis and lead to improved patient outcomes.

## Direct impact of commonly used dietary emulsifiers on human gut microbiota.
 25.03.2021, _S Naimi, E Viennois, AT Gewirtz, B Chassaing_


Epidemiologic evidence and animal studies implicate dietary emulsifiers in contributing to the increased prevalence of diseases associated with intestinal inflammation, including inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic syndrome. Two synthetic emulsifiers in particular, carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80, profoundly impact intestinal microbiota in a manner that promotes gut inflammation and associated disease states. In contrast, the extent to which other food additives with emulsifying properties might impact intestinal microbiota composition and function is not yet known.

## Establishing causality in Salmonella-microbiota-host interaction: The use of gnotobiotic mouse models and synthetic microbial communities.
 25.03.2021, _B Stecher_


Colonization resistance (CR), the ability to block infections by potentially harmful microbes, is a fundamental function of host-associated microbial communities and highly conserved between animals and humans. Environmental factors such as antibiotics and diet can disturb microbial community composition and thereby predispose to opportunistic infections. The most prominent is Clostridioides difficile, the causative agent of diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. In addition, the risk to succumb to infections with genuine human enteric pathogens like nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) is also increased by a low-diverse, diet or antibiotic-disrupted microbiota. Despite extensive microbial community profiling efforts, only a limited set of microorganisms have been causally linked with protection against enteric pathogens. Furthermore, it remains a challenge to predict colonization resistance from complex microbiome signatures due to context-dependent action of microorganisms. In the past decade, the study of NTS infection has led to the description of several fundamental principles of microbiota-host-pathogen interaction. In this review, I will give an overview on the current state of knowledge in this field and outline experimental approaches to gain functional insight to the role of specific microbes, functions and metabolites in Salmonella-microbiota-host interaction. In particular, I will highlight the value of mouse infection models, which, in combination with culture collections, synthetic communities and gnotobiotic models have become essential tools to screen for protective members of the microbiota and establishing causal relationship and mechanisms in infection research.

## Gut microbiota dysbiosis promotes age-related atrial fibrillation by lipopolysaccharide and glucose-induced activation of NLRP3-inflammasome.
 23.03.2021, _Y Zhang, S Zhang, B Li, Y Luo, Y Gong, X Jin, J Zhang, Y Zhou, X Zhuo, Z Wang, X Zhao, X Han, Y Gao, H Yu, D Liang, S Zhao, D Sun, D Wang, W Xu, G Qu, W Bo, D Li, Y Wu, Y Li_


Aging is the most significant contributor to the increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF). The gut microbiota dysbiosis is involved in age-related diseases. However, whether the aged-associated dysbiosis contributes to age-related AF is still unknown. Direct demonstration that the aged gut microbiota is sufficient to transmit the enhanced AF susceptibility in a young host via microbiota-intestinal barrier-atria axis has not yet been reported. This study aimed to determine whether gut microbiota dysbiosis affects age-related AF.

## Composition and structure of the skin microbiota of rorquals off the Eastern South Pacific.

Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled the large-scale interrogation of microbiota in the most diverse environments, including host-associated microbiota. This has led to the recognition that the skin microbiota of rorquals is specific and structurally different from that of the ocean. This study reveals the skin microbiome of 85 wild individuals along the Chilean coast belonging to Megaptera novaeangliae, Balaenoptera musculus, and Balaenoptera physalus. Alpha diversity analysis revealed significant differences in richness and phylogenetic diversity, particularly among humpback whales from different locations and between blue and humpback whales. Beta diversity was partially explained by host and location but only accounting for up to 17% of microbiota variability (adjusted VPA). Overall, we found that microbiota composition was dominated by bacterial genera such as Cardiobacter, Moraxella, Tenacibaculum, Stenotrophomonas, Flavobacteria, and Pseudomonas. We also found that no ASVs were associated with the three rorqual species. Up to 4 ASVs were specific of a location, indicating a great variability in the microbiota. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the composition and structure of the skin microbiota of whales off the coast of Chile, providing a foundational dataset to understand the microbiota's role in rorquals.
