This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Effect of Laser and Energy-based Device Therapies to Minimize Surgical Scar Formation: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.
 08.01.2024, _S Yenyuwadee, P Achavanuntakul, P Phisalprapa, M Levin, S Saokaew, S Kanchanasurakit, W Manuskiatti_


Utilization of lasers and energy-based devices for surgical scar minimization has been substantially evaluated in placebo-controlled trials. The aim of this study was to compare reported measures of efficacy of lasers and energy-based devices in clinical trials in preventing surgical scar formation in a systematic review and network meta-analyses. Five electronic databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library, were searched to retrieve relevant articles. The search was limited to randomized controlled trials that reported on clinical outcomes of surgical scars with treatment initiation no later than 6 months after surgery and a follow-up period of at least 3 months. A total of 18 randomized controlled trials involving 482 participants and 671 postsurgical wounds were included in the network meta-analyses. The results showed that the most efficacious treatments were achieved using low-level laser therapy) (weighted mean difference -3.78; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -6.32, -1.24) and pulsed dye laser (weighted mean difference -2.46; 95% CI -4.53, -0.38). Nevertheless, low-level laser therapy and pulsed dye laser demonstrated comparable outcomes in surgical scar minimization (weighted mean difference -1.32, 95% CI -3.53, 0.89). The findings of this network meta-analyses suggest that low-level laser therapy and pulsed dye laser are both effective treatments for minimization of scar formation following primary closure of surgical wounds with comparable treatment outcomes.

## BilR is a gut microbial enzyme that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen.

Metabolism of haem by-products such as bilirubin by humans and their gut microbiota is essential to human health, as excess serum bilirubin can cause jaundice and even neurological damage. The bacterial enzymes that reduce bilirubin to urobilinogen, a key step in this pathway, have remained unidentified. Here we used biochemical analyses and comparative genomics to identify BilR as a gut-microbiota-derived bilirubin reductase that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen. We delineated the BilR sequences from similar reductases through the identification of key residues critical for bilirubin reduction and found that BilR is predominantly encoded by Firmicutes species. Analysis of human gut metagenomes revealed that BilR is nearly ubiquitous in healthy adults, but prevalence is decreased in neonates and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. This discovery sheds light on the role of the gut microbiome in bilirubin metabolism and highlights the significance of the gut-liver axis in maintaining bilirubin homeostasis.

Establishing the infant's gut microbiota has long-term implications on health and immunity. Breastfeeding is recognized as the best practice of infant nutrition in comparison with formula feeding. We evaluated the effects of the primary feeding practices by analyzing the infant growth and the potential association with gut diseases. A cross-sectional and observational study was designed. This study included 55 mothers with infants, who were divided according to their feeding practices in breastfeeding (BF), formula feeding (FF), and combined breast and formula feeding (CF). Anthropometric measurements of the participants were recorded. Additionally, non-invasive fecal samples from the infants were collected to analyze the microbiota by sequencing, immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration (ELISA), and volatile organic compounds (gas chromatography with an electronic nose). Results showed that the microbiota diversity in the BF group was the highest compared to the other two groups. The IgA levels in the BF group were twice as high as those in the FF group. Moreover, the child´s growth in the BF group showed the best infant development when the data were compared at birth to the recollection time, as noted by the correlation with a decreased concentration of toxic volatile organic compounds. Interestingly, the CF group showed a significant difference in health status when the data were compared with the FF group. We conclude that early health practices influence children's growth, which is relevant to further research about how those infants' health evolved.

Aquaculture plays an important role in global protein supplies and food security. The ban on antibiotics as feed additive proposes urgent need to develop alternatives. Gut microbiota plays important roles in the metabolism and immunity of fish and has the potential to give rise to novel solutions for challenges confronted by fish culture. However, our understanding of fish gut microbiome is still lacking.

The observation that the intestinal microbiota is central in the development of IBD suggests that dietary fiber, the microbiota's primary source of nourishment, could play a central role in these diseases. Accordingly, enriching diets with specific soluble fibers remodels microbiota and modulates colitis sensitivity. In humans, a recent study suggests that the microbiota of select IBD patients might influence the impacts they would experience upon fiber exposure. We sought here to define the extent to which individual microbiotas varied in their responsiveness to purified soluble fiber inulin and psyllium. Moreover, the extent to which such variance might impact proneness to colitis.

The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.

Blackcurrant is available as a traditional medicine in Europe. However, the detailed effects of blackcurrant on the human gut microbiota remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the prebiotic effects of a blackcurrant extract using a human fecal culture model in six healthy subjects. Feces were individually inoculated into a medium with or without the blackcurrant extract and then fermented for 48 hr under anaerobic conditions. The results obtained from analysis of samples from the fermented medium demonstrated that after 48 hr of fermentation, the pH of the medium with the blackcurrant extract was significantly decreased (control, 6.62 ± 0.20; blackcurrant extract, 6.41 ± 0.33; p=0.0312). A 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of the microbiota of the fermented medium showed a significant increase in the relative abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae. In measuring the concentrations of putrefactive components in the fermented medium, we found that the blackcurrant extract significantly reduced ammonia levels and displayed a tendency toward reduced indole levels. Our results suggest that blackcurrant extract could be a potential ingredient for relief of putrefactive components in the gut.

## Rice gluten meal as a substitute for soybean meal in the diets for growing rabbits.
 08.01.2024, _FA Hassan, RA Alhotan, YA Attia, KM Mahrose, HF Amin, IH Salim, LF Abdel-Mawla, F Bovera, AM Mansour, I Michalak_


The impacts of different dietary levels of rice gluten meal (RGM) on growth performance, digestibility, carcass characteristics, and blood traits of growing New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were studied. One hundred and twenty, 6 weeks old weaned male rabbits (body weight; 682 [g] ± 23) were randomly allotted into four groups. The control diet contained 160 [g/kg] soybean meal (SBM), while the other three diets were obtained by replacing 40, 80, and 120 [g/kg] SBM with RGM (RGM40, RGM80, and RGM120, respectively). The results showed that RGM contained higher levels of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), ash, and gross energy than SBM. RGM contained a high level of arginine followed by leucine and valine as essential amino acids and high levels of glutamic, aspartic acid, and alanine as non-essential amino acids. The obtained results showed that the final body weight of rabbits fed diets containing 40, 80, and 120 [g/kg] RGM was higher than those fed the control diet. The daily weight gain of rabbits fed RGM diets increased (p &lt; 0.05) by 10.50%, 6.50%, and 10.00%, respectively, compared to the control group. Rabbits fed RGM80 showed the highest (p &lt; 0.05) digestibility of DM, organic matter (OM), EE, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), and acid detergent fibre (ADF) compared to the other tested levels. Rabbits fed RGM120 had the highest (p &lt; 0.05) digestible energy (DE) and digestible crude protein (DCP) values. RGM inclusion levels of 40 and 80 [g/kg] increased (p &lt; 0.05) plasma total protein and albumin compared to the control group. Rabbits fed a diet containing RGM40 had the highest (p &lt; 0.05) globulin level. The highest (p &lt; 0.05) plasma urea concentration level was measured in the rabbit group fed the RGM120 diet. Conclusively, RGM could be a valuable ingredient for growing rabbits, as at all the tested levels improved growth performance, digestibility, and nutritional values.

The aim of this study was to compare reported measures of efficacy of lasers and energy-based devices in clinical trials in preventing surgical scar formation in a systematic review and network meta-analyses. Five electronic databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library, were searched to retrieve relevant articles. The search was limited to randomized controlled trials that reported on clinical outcomes of surgical scars with treatment initiation no later than 6 months after surgery and a follow-up period of at least 3 months. A total of 18 randomized controlled trials involving 482 participants and 671 postsurgical wounds were included in the network meta-analyses. The results showed that the most efficacious treatments were achieved using low-level laser therapy) (weighted mean difference -3.78; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -6.32, -1.24) and pulsed dye laser (weighted mean difference -2.46; 95% CI -4.53, -0.38). Nevertheless, low-level laser therapy and pulsed dye laser demonstrated comparable outcomes in surgical scar minimization (weighted mean difference -1.32, 95% CI -3.53, 0.89). The findings of this network meta-analyses suggest that low-level laser therapy and pulsed dye laser are both effective treatments for minimization of scar formation following primary closure of surgical wounds with comparable treatment outcomes.

Nanodecoy systems based on analogues of viral cellular receptors assembled onto fluid lipid-based membranes of nano/extravescicles are potential new tools to complement classic therapeutic or preventive antiviral approaches. The need for lipid-based membranes for transmembrane receptor anchorage may pose technical challenges along industrial translation, calling for alternative geometries for receptor multimerization. Here we developed a semisynthetic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanodecoy by multimerizing the biotin labelled virus cell receptor -ACE2- ectodomain onto a poly-avidin nanoparticle (NP) based on the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly-ANANAS. The ability of the assembly to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and the affinity of the ACE2:viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction were measured at different ACE2:NP ratios. At ACE2:NP = 30, 90 % SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition at ACE2 nanomolar concentration was registered on both Wuhan and Omicron variants, with ten-fold higher potency than the monomeric protein. Lower and higher ACE2 densities were less efficient suggesting that functional recognition between multi-ligand NPs and multi-receptor virus surfaces requires optimal geometrical relationships. In vivo studies in mice showed that the biodistribution and safety profiles of the nanodecoy are potentially suitable for preventing viral infection upon nasal instillation. Viral receptor multimerization using ANANAS is a convenient process which, in principle, could be rapidly adapted to counteract also other viral infections.

The rhizosheath, a cohesive soil layer firmly adhering to plant roots, plays a vital role in facilitating water and mineral uptake. In pearl millet, rhizosheath formation is genetically controlled and influenced by root exudates. Here, we investigated the impact of root exudates on the microbiota composition, interactions, and assembly processes, and rhizosheath structure in pearl millet using four distinct lines with contrasting soil aggregation abilities.

## mEnrich-seq: methylation-guided enrichment sequencing of bacterial taxa of interest from microbiome.

Metagenomics has enabled the comprehensive study of microbiomes. However, many applications would benefit from a method that sequences specific bacterial taxa of interest, but not most background taxa. We developed mEnrich-seq (in which 'm' stands for methylation and seq for sequencing) for enriching taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self versus nonself differentiation by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, individually or in combination, to deplete host and background taxa while enriching targeted taxa. This idea is integrated with library preparation procedures and applied in several applications to enrich (up to 117-fold) pathogenic or beneficial bacteria from human urine and fecal samples, including species that are hard to culture or of low abundance. We assessed 4,601 bacterial strains with mapped methylomes so far and showed broad applicability of mEnrich-seq. mEnrich-seq provides microbiome researchers with a versatile and cost-effective approach for selective sequencing of diverse taxa of interest.

Diverse host factors drive microbial variation in plant-associated environments, whereas their genetic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. To address this, we coupled the analyses of plant genetics and microbiomes in this study. Using 100 tea plant (Camellia sinensis) cultivars, the microbiomes of rhizosphere, root endosphere and phyllosphere showed clear compartment-specific assembly, whereas the subpopulation differentiation of tea cultivars exhibited small effects on microbial variation in each compartment. Through microbiome genome-wide association studies, we examined the interactions between tea genetic loci and microbial variation. Notably, genes related to the cell wall and carbon catabolism were heavily linked to root endosphere microbial composition, whereas genes related to the metabolism of metal ions and small organic molecules were overrepresented in association with rhizosphere microbial composition. Moreover, a set of tea genetic variants, including the cytoskeleton-related formin homology interacting protein 1 gene, were strongly associated with the β-diversity of phyllosphere microbiomes, implying their interactions with the overall structure of microbial communities. Our results create a catalogue of tea genetic determinants interacting with microbiomes and reveal the compartment-specific microbiome assembly driven by host genetics.
