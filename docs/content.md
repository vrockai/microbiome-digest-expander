Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with persistent oral microbial dysbiosis. The human β-glucuronidase (GUS) degrades constituents of the periodontium and is used as a biomarker for periodontitis severity. However, the human microbiome also encodes GUS enzymes, and the role of these factors in periodontal disease is poorly understood. Here, we define the 53 unique GUSs in the human oral microbiome and examine diverse GUS orthologs from periodontitis-associated pathogens. Oral bacterial GUS enzymes are more efficient polysaccharide degraders and processers of biomarker substrates than the human enzyme, particularly at pHs associated with disease progression. Using a microbial GUS-selective inhibitor, we show that GUS activity is reduced in clinical samples obtained from individuals with untreated periodontitis and that the degree of inhibition correlates with disease severity. Together, these results establish oral GUS activity as a biomarker that captures both host and microbial contributions to periodontitis, facilitating more efficient clinical monitoring and treatment paradigms for this common inflammatory disease.

This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of intestinal microbiota in children with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) under 3 years old. Fresh feces were collected from 54 children with HFMD and 30 healthy children. All of them were &lt;3 years old. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA amplicons was performed. Between the 2 groups, the richness, diversity, and structure of the intestinal microbiota were analyzed by α-diversity and β-diversity. Linear discriminant analysis and LEfSe analyses were used to compare different bacterial classifications. The sex and age of the children in the 2 groups were not statistically significant (P = .92 and P = .98, respectively). Compared to healthy children, the Shannon index, Ace index, and Chao index were lower in children with HFMD (P = .027, P = .012, and P = .012, respectively). Based on the weighted or unweighted UniFrac distance analysis, the structure of the intestinal microbiota in HFMD was also significantly changed (P = .002 and P &lt; .001, respectively). Linear discriminant analysis and LEfSe analysis showed that the changes of key bacteria were manifested as a decrease in Prevotella and Clostridium_XIVa (P &lt; .001 and P &lt; .001, respectively), while Escherichia and Bifidobacterium increased (P = .025 and P = .001, respectively). Children with HFMD under 3 years of age have intestinal microbiota disorder and show a decrease in diversity and richness. The decrease in the abundance of Prevotella and Clostridium, which can produce short-chain fatty acids, is also one of the characteristics of the change. These results can offer a theoretical foundation for the pathogenesis and microecological treatment of HFMD in infants.

The upper respiratory tract is an obliged pathway for respiratory pathogens and a healthy microbiota may support the host's mucosal immunity preventing infection. We analyzed the nasopharyngeal microbiome in tuberculosis household contacts (HHCs) and its association with latent tuberculosis infection (TBI). A prospective cohort of HHCs was established and latent TBI status was assessed by serial interferon-γ release assay (IGRA). Nasopharyngeal swabs collected at baseline were processed for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The 82 participants included in the analysis were classified as: (a) non-TBI [IGRA negative at baseline and follow-up, no active TB (n = 31)], (b) pre-TBI [IGRA negative at baseline but converted to IGRA positive or developed active TB at follow-up (n = 16)], and (c) TBI [IGRA positive at enrollment (n = 35)]. Predominant phyla were Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidota. TBI group had a lower alpha diversity compared to non-TBI (padj = 0.04) and pre-TBI (padj = 0.04). Only TBI and non-TBI had beta diversity differences (padj = 0.035). Core microbiomes' had unique genera, and genus showed differential abundance among groups. HHCs with established latent TBI showed reduced nasopharyngeal microbial diversity with distinctive taxonomical composition. Whether a pre-existing microbiome feature favors, are a consequence, or protects against Mycobacterium tuberculosis needs further investigation.

## Neuropsychiatric sequelae after liver transplantation and their possible mechanism via the microbiota-gut-liver-brain axis.
 10.05.2023, _W Jing, C Bi, Z Fang, C Qian, J Chen, J Yu, G Tian, M Ye, Z Liu_


Patients after liver transplantation are often impacted by mental and even neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, sleep disorders, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Neuropsychiatric sequelae have an adverse impact on rehabilitation and can even incapacitate people, reducing their quality of life. Despite screening tools and effective treatments, neuropsychiatric sequelae after liver transplantation (NSALT) have not been fully diagnosed and treated. Current research suggests that NSALT may be partly related to intestinal microbial variation, but the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this review, we describe the clinical and diagnostic features, prevalence, prediction, clinical course and outcome, management, and treatment of NSALT; we also summarize their mechanisms through the microbiota-gut-liver-brain axis. Finally, we propose to improve NSALT on the basis of adjusting the gastrointestinal flora, immune inflammation or vagus nerve (VN), providing a novel strategy for clinical prevention and treatment.

## Phage-display immunoprecipitation sequencing of the antibody epitope repertoire in inflammatory bowel disease reveals distinct antibody signatures.
 10.05.2023, _AR Bourgonje, S Andreu-Sánchez, T Vogl, S Hu, A Vich Vila, R Gacesa, S Leviatan, A Kurilshikov, S Klompus, IN Kalka, HM van Dullemen, A Weinberger, MC Visschedijk, EAM Festen, KN Faber, C Wijmenga, G Dijkstra, E Segal, J Fu, A Zhernakova, RK Weersma_


Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), e.g., Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. A comprehensive overview of an IBD-specific antibody epitope repertoire is, however, lacking. Using high-throughput phage-display immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-Seq), we identified antibodies against 344,000 antimicrobial, immune, and food antigens in 497 individuals with IBD compared with 1,326 controls. IBD was characterized by 373 differentially abundant antibody responses (202 overrepresented and 171 underrepresented), with 17% shared by both IBDs, 55% unique to CD, and 28% unique to UC. Antibody reactivities against bacterial flagellins dominated in CD and were associated with ileal involvement, fibrostenotic disease, and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody positivity, but not with fecal microbiome composition. Antibody epitope repertoires accurately discriminated CD from controls (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.89), and similar discrimination was achieved when using only ten antibodies (AUC = 0.87). Individuals with IBD thus show a distinct antibody repertoire against selected peptides, allowing clinical stratification and discovery of immunological targets.

## L-Fucose is involved in human-gut microbiome interactions.
 06.05.2023, _J Kim, YS Jin, KH Kim_


L-Fucose is one of the key metabolites in human-gut microbiome interactions. It is continuously synthesized by humans in the form of fucosylated glycans and fucosyl-oligosaccharides and delivered into the gut throughout their lifetime. Gut microorganisms metabolize L-fucose and produce short-chain fatty acids, which are absorbed by epithelial cells and used as energy sources or signaling molecules. Recent studies have revealed that the carbon flux in L-fucose metabolism by gut microorganisms is distinct from that in other sugar metabolisms because of cofactor imbalance and low efficiencies in energy synthesis of L-fucose metabolism. The large amounts of short-chain fatty acids produced during microbial L-fucose metabolism are used by epithelial cells to recover most of the energy used up during L-fucose synthesis. In this review, we present a detailed overview of microbial L-fucose metabolism and a potential solution for disease treatment and prevention using genetically engineered probiotics that modulate fucose metabolism. Our review contributes to the understanding of human-gut microbiome interactions through L-fucose metabolism. KEY POINTS: • Fucose-metabolizing microorganisms produce large amounts of short-chain fatty acids • Fucose metabolism differs from other sugar metabolisms by cofactor imbalance • Modulating fucose metabolism is the key to control host-gut microbiome interactions.

Intermittent fasting (IF) has a protective role across a wide range of chronic disorders, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but its protection against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is still lacking. This study sought to investigate how IF alleviates NASH by regulating gut microbiota and bile acids (BAs) composition.

Some insects can degrade both natural and synthetic plastic polymers, their host and gut microbes play crucial roles in this process. However, there is still a scientific gap in understanding how the insect adapted to the polystyrene (PS) diet from natural feed. In this study, we analyzed diet consumption, gut microbiota responses, and metabolic pathways of Tenebrio molitor larvae exposed to PS and corn straw (CS).

## The good, the bad, and the phosphate: regulation of beneficial and detrimental plant-microbe interactions by the plant phosphate status.
 05.05.2023, _M Paries, C Gutjahr_


Phosphate (Pi ) is indispensable for life on this planet. However, for sessile land plants it is poorly accessible. Therefore, plants have developed a variety of strategies for enhanced acquisition and recycling of Pi . The mechanisms to cope with Pi limitation as well as direct uptake of Pi from the substrate via the root epidermis are regulated by a conserved Pi starvation response (PSR) system based on a family of key transcription factors (TFs) and their inhibitors. Furthermore, plants obtain Pi indirectly through symbiosis with mycorrhiza fungi, which employ their extensive hyphal network to drastically increase the soil volume that can be explored by plants for Pi . Besides mycorrhizal symbiosis, there is also a variety of other interactions with epiphytic, endophytic, and rhizospheric microbes that can indirectly or directly influence plant Pi uptake. It was recently discovered that the PSR pathway is involved in the regulation of genes that promote formation and maintenance of AM symbiosis. Furthermore, the PSR system influences plant immunity and can also be a target of microbial manipulation. It is known for decades that the nutritional status of plants influences the outcome of plant-microbe interactions. The first molecular explanations for these observations are now emerging.
