Long-lived individuals have been extensively studied as a model to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in aging, but their gut fungi remain almost unexplored. Here, we recruited a community-dwelling cohort of 251 participants (24-108 years, including 47 centenarians) from Guangxi in China to characterize the gut mycobiome signatures. We found gut mycobiome markedly varied during aging and determined aging as a predominant factor driving these variations. For long-lived individuals, core taxa, including Penicillium and Aspergillus, were maintained and Candida enterotype was enriched when compared with old counterparts. Individuals with this enterotype were more likely to possess Bacteroides enterotype enriched in young and centenarians. Moreover, the drivers from Candida enterotype were positively linked with the bacteria components dominated in Bacteroides enterotype. We also identified potentially beneficial yeasts-enriched features to differentiate long-lived individuals from others. Our findings suggest that the gut mycobiome develops with aging, and long-lived individuals possess unique fungal signatures.

## Core microbiome-associated proteins associated with ulcerative colitis interact with cytokines for synergistic or antagonistic effects on gut bacteria.
 29.07.2024, _T Zhang, H Zhong, L Lin, Z Zhang, K Xue, F He, Y Luo, P Wang, Z Zhao, L Cong, P Pang, X Li, H Shan, Z Yan_


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is associated with a loss or an imbalance of host-microorganism interactions. However, such interactions at protein levels remain largely unknown. Here, we applied a depletion-assisted metaproteomics approach to obtain in-depth host-microbiome association networks of IBD, where the core host proteins shifted from those maintaining mucosal homeostasis in controls to those involved in inflammation, proteolysis, and intestinal barrier in IBD. Microbial nodes such as short-chain fatty acid producer-related host-microbial crosstalk were lost or suppressed by inflammatory proteins in IBD. Guided by protein-protein association networks, we employed proteomics and lipidomics to investigate the effects of UC-related core proteins S100A8, S100A9, and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) on gut bacteria. These proteins suppressed purine nucleotide biosynthesis in stool-derived in vitro communities, which was all reduced in IBD stool samples. Single species study revealed that S100A8, S100A9, and cytokines can synergistically or antagonistically alter gut bacteria intracellular and secreted proteome, with combined S100A8 and S100A9 potently inhibiting beneficial Bifidobacterium adolescentis. Furthermore, these inflammatory proteins only altered the extracellular but not intracellular proteins of Ruminococcus gnavus. Generally, S100A8 induced more significant bacterial proteome changes than S100A9, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. But gut bacteria degrade significantly more S100A8 than S100A9 in the presence of both proteins. Among the investigated species, distinct lipid alterations were only observed in Bacteroides vulgatus treated with combined S100A8, S100A9, and cytokines. These results provided a valuable resource of inflammatory protein centric host-microbial molecular interactions.

Gut dysbiosis has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most prevalent cancer in the world. This study compares microbiota taxonomic and abundance results obtained by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S) and whole shotgun metagenomic sequencing to investigate their reliability for bacteria profiling. The experimental design included 156 human stool samples from healthy controls, advanced (high-risk) colorectal lesion patients (HRL), and CRC cases, with each sample sequenced using both 16S and shotgun methods. We thoroughly compared both sequencing technologies at the species, genus, and family annotation levels, the abundance differences in these taxa, sparsity, alpha and beta diversities, ability to train prediction models, and the similarity of the microbial signature derived from these models.

Different delivery methods can cause variations in the composition and structure of intestinal microbiota in neonates. However, the impact of the microecological environment on host immune function requires further investigation. In this study, 75 healthy neonates were divided into two groups: vaginal delivery group (n = 36) and cesarean section group (n = 39). Fecal and peripheral blood samples were collected from the 7th to the 10th day. 16S rRNA sequencing technique was performed to investigate the gut microbiota on fecal samples. Levels of immunoglobulins and Th1 and Th2 cells in the peripheral blood of neonates were measured. The abundance of Escherichia, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides in neonates in the cesarean section group was significantly lower than that in the vaginal delivery group. Metabolic pathway analysis showed three significantly up-regulated metabolic pathways in the intestinal microbiota of neonates in the cesarean section group. The levels of serum IgG and IL-12p70 in the cesarean section group were lower than those in the vaginal delivery group, and the proportion of IFN-γ/IL-4 was significantly lower in the cesarean section group compared to the vaginal delivery group. The mode of delivery has potential impact on the intestinal microbiota and immune functions of neonates, potentially leading to an imbalance of Th1/Th2 cells in neonates delivered by cesarean section.

## Effects of Akkermansia muciniphila on Gut Morphology, Antioxidant Indices, and Gut Microbiome of Mice Under Heat Stress.
 31.07.2024, _C Luo, Y Du, R Zhu, Q Qi, S Luo, X Feng_


Nutritional manipulations can reduce the detrimental effects of heat stress on animal health and production. Akkermansia muciniphila (AM) is an innovative beneficial bacteria and can be used for conventional use as dietary supplements and pharmaceutical application. This study aimed to investigate the effects of administering AM on gut morphology, antioxidant indices, and gut microbiome of mice during heat stress. A total of 24 BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to three groups including the control group (CON), heat stress group (HS), and AM administration under heat stress group (AM). Our results showed heat stress significantly increased the water consumption of mice. Administration of AM did not improve feed intake or weight gain. The serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase as well as antioxidant parameters were not different among the three groups. Heat stress decreased the jejunal villus height, and AM could reverse this effect. AM administration significantly increased the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobiota at the phylum level. At the genus level, heat stress and AM groups tended to have a lower abundance of Alloprevotella. In addition, AM tended to increase the relative abundance of [Eubacterium]_xylanophilum_group in comparison with the other two groups. In summary, administration of AM can alleviate the damage of heat stress to the jejunum. However, it has no effect on serum antioxidant parameters, and its effect on the cecal microbiota is limited.

## Gut microbiota mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of supplemental infrared irradiation in mice.
 31.07.2024, _S Wang, L Chen, Z Ma, L Zhao, Y Lu, Y Fu, H Liu_


In recent years, studies have shown that low-dose supplemental infrared (IR) irradiation exhibits systemic anti-inflammatory effects. The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a potential mediator of these effects due to its role in regulating host metabolism and inflammatory responses. To investigate the role of gut microbiota diversity and metabolite changes in the mechanism of light-emitting diodes (LED) infrared's anti-inflammatory action, we conducted IR irradiation on mice. Serum inflammatory cytokines were measured using ELISA, and fecal samples were subjected to metagenomic, untargeted, and targeted metabolomic analyses. Our results demonstrated a significant increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the IR group, accompanied by a declining trend in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Gut microbiome analysis revealed distinct alterations in composition and functional genes between the groups, including the enrichment of beneficial bacteria like various species of Parabacteroides and Akkermansia muciniphila in the IR group. Notably, the IR group exhibited enrichment in carbohydrate metabolism pathways and a reduction in DNA damage and repair pathways. Furthermore, targeted metabolomic analysis highlighted a notable increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyric acid and isobutyric acid, which positively correlated with the abundance of several beneficial bacteria. These findings suggest a potential interplay between gut microbiota-derived SCFAs and the anti-inflammatory response. In conclusion, our study provides comprehensive insights into the changes in gut microbiota species and functions associated with IR irradiation. Moreover, we emphasize the significance of altered SCFAs levels in the IR group, which may contribute to the observed anti-inflammatory effects. Our findings contribute valuable evidence supporting the role of low-dose infrared light irradiation as an anti-inflammatory therapy.

## Short-chain fatty acids ameliorate imiquimod-induced skin thickening and IL-17 levels and alter gut microbiota in mice: a metagenomic association analysis.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been proposed to have anti-inflammatory effects and improve immune homeostasis. We aimed to examine the effects of SCFAs on skin phenotype, systemic inflammation, and gut microbiota in mice with psoriasis-like inflammation. Imiquimod (IMQ)-treated C57BL/6 mice served as the study model. We conducted a metagenomic association study of IMQ-mice treated with SCFAs or anti-IL-17 antibody using whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The associations among SCFA supplements, skin thickness, circulating inflammatory profiles, and fecal microbiota profiles were investigated. The microbiome study was performed using pipelines for phylogenetic analysis, functional gene analysis, and pathway analysis. In IMQ-treated mice, there were increases in skin thickness and splenic weight, as well as unique fecal microbial profiles. SCFAs ameliorated IMQ-induced skin thickening, splenic weight gain, and serum IL-17F levels, with results that were comparable with those receiving anti-IL-17 treatment. IMQ-treated mice receiving SCFAs had greater microbial diversity than mice treated with IMQ alone. SCFAs and anti-IL17 treatment were associated with alteration of gut microbiota, with increased prevalences of Oscillospiraceae and Lachnopiraceae and decreased prevalences of Muribaculaceae and Bacteroides, which have been predicted to be associated with increased glycan degradation, phenylalanine metabolism, and xylene degradation. SCFAs may mitigate IMQ-induced skin thickening and IL-17F levels and alter fecal microbiota profiles in IMQ-treated mice.

## Facultative endosymbiosis between cellulolytic protists and methanogenic archaea in the gut of the Formosan termite Coptotermes formosanus.
 31.07.2024, _M Kaneko, T Omori, K Igai, T Mabuchi, M Sakai-Tazawa, A Nishihara, K Kihara, T Yoshimura, M Ohkuma, Y Hongoh_


Anaerobic protists frequently harbour methanogenic archaea, which apparently contribute to the hosts' fermentative metabolism by consuming excess H2. However, the ecological properties of endosymbiotic methanogens remain elusive in many cases. Here we investigated the ecology and genome of the endosymbiotic methanogen of the Cononympha protists in the hindgut of the termite Coptotermes formosanus. Microscopic and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analyses revealed that a single species, designated here "Candidatus Methanobrevibacter cononymphae", is associated with both Cononympha leidyi and Cononympha koidzumii and that its infection rate in Cononympha cells varied from 0.0% to 99.8% among termite colonies. Fine-scale network analysis indicated that multiple 16S rRNA sequence variants coexisted within a single host cell and that identical variants were present in both Cononympha species and also on the gut wall. Thus, "Ca. Methanobrevibacter cononymphae" is a facultative endosymbiont, transmitted vertically with frequent exchanges with the gut environment. Indeed, transmission electron microscopy showed escape or uptake of methanogens from/by a Cononympha cell. The genome of "Ca. Methanobrevibacter cononymphae" showed features consistent with its facultative lifestyle: i.e., the genome size (2.7 Mbp) comparable to those of free-living relatives; the pseudogenization of the formate dehydrogenase gene fdhA, unnecessary within the non-formate-producing host cell; the dependence on abundant acetate in the host cell as an essential carbon source; and the presence of a catalase gene, required for colonization on the microoxic gut wall. Our study revealed a versatile endosymbiosis between the methanogen and protists, which may be a strategy responding to changing conditions in the termite gut.

## Rodents consuming the same toxic diet harbor a unique functional core microbiome.
 31.07.2024, _TE Stapleton, LM Lindsey, H Sundar, MD Dearing_


Gut microbiota are intrinsic to an herbivorous lifestyle, but very little is known about how plant secondary compounds (PSCs), which are often toxic, influence these symbiotic partners. Here we interrogated the possibility of unique functional core microbiomes in populations of two species of woodrat (Neotoma lepida and bryanti) that have independently converged to feed on the same toxic diet (creosote bush; Larrea tridentata) and compared them to populations that do not feed on creosote bush. Leveraging this natural experiment, we collected samples across a large geographic region in the U.S. desert southwest from 20 populations (~ 150 individuals) with differential ingestion of creosote bush and analyzed three gut regions (foregut, cecum, hindgut) using16S sequencing and shotgun metagenomics. In each gut region sampled, we found a distinctive set of microbes in individuals feeding on creosote bush that were more abundant than other ASVs, enriched in creosote feeding woodrats, and occurred more frequently than would be predicted by chance. Creosote core members were from microbial families e.g., Eggerthellaceae, known to metabolize plant secondary compounds and three of the identified core KEGG orthologs (4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, benzoyl-CoA reductase subunit B, and 2-pyrone-4, 6-dicarboxylate lactonase) coded for enzymes that play important roles in metabolism of plant secondary compounds. The results support the hypothesis that the ingestion of creosote bush sculpts the microbiome across all major gut regions to select for functional characteristics associated with the degradation of the PSCs in this unique diet.

Plant-sucking insects have intricate associations with a diverse array of microorganisms to facilitate their adaptation to specific ecological niches. The midgut of phytophagous true bugs is generally structured into four distinct compartments to accommodate their microbiota. Nevertheless, there is limited understanding regarding the origins of these gut microbiomes, the mechanisms behind microbial community assembly, and the interactions between gut microbiomes and their insect hosts. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive survey of microbial communities within the midgut compartments of a bean bug Riptortus pedestris, soybean plant, and bulk soil across 12 distinct geographical fields in China, utilizing high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. Our findings illuminated that gut microbiota of the plant-sucking insects predominantly originated from the surrounding soil environment, and plants also play a subordinate role in mediating microbial acquisition for the insects. Furthermore, our investigation suggested that the composition of the insect gut microbiome was probably shaped by host selection and/or microbe-microbe interactions at the gut compartment level, with marginal influence from soil and geographical factors. Additionally, we had unveiled a noteworthy dynamic in the acquisition of core bacterial taxa, particularly Burkholderia, which were initially sourced from the environment and subsequently enriched within the insect midgut compartments. This bacterial enrichment played a significant role in enhancing insect host reproduction. These findings contribute to our evolving understanding of microbiomes within the insect-plant-soil ecosystem, shedding additional light on the intricate interactions between insects and their microbiomes that underpin the ecological significance of microbial partnerships in host adaptation.

## Link between bacterial communities and contrasted loads in ectoparasitic monogeneans from the external mucus of two wild sparid species (Teleostei).
 31.07.2024, _J Revault, Y Desdevises, É Magnanou_


While teleost fishes represent two thirds of marine vertebrates, the role of their external microbiota in relationship with their environment remains poorly studied, especially in wild populations. Hence, the interaction of their microbiota with ectoparasites is largely unknown. Microbiota can act as a protective barrier against pathogens, and/or be involved in host recognition by parasites. Thus, host-parasite associations should now be considered as a tripartite interplay where the microbiota shapes the host phenotype and its relation to parasites. Monogeneans (Platyhelminthes) are direct life cycle ectoparasites commonly found on teleost skin and gills. The role of bacterial communities within skin and gill mucus which either pre-exist monogeneans infestation or follow it remain unclear. This is investigated in this study using the association between Sparidae (Teleostei) and their specific monogenean ectoparasites of the Lamellodiscus genus. We are exploring specificity mechanisms through the characterization of the external mucus microbiota of two wild sparid species using 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing. We investigated how these bacterial communities are related to constrated Lamellodiscus monogeneans parasitic load.

## Host genetic variation and specialized metabolites from wheat leaves enriches for phyllosphere Pseudomonas spp. with enriched antibiotic resistomes.
 29.07.2024, _Q Xiang, D Lin, ZJ Yang, RX Han, TL Zhang, QL Chen, D Zhu, J Penuelas, YG Zhu_


Antibiotic resistance in plant-associated microbiomes poses significant risks for agricultural ecosystems and human health. Although accumulating evidence suggests a role for plant genotypes in shaping their microbiome, almost nothing is known about how the changes of plant genetic information affect the co-evolved plant microbiome carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Here, we selected 16 wheat cultivars and experimentally explored the impact of host genetic variation on phyllosphere microbiome, ARGs, and metabolites. Our results demonstrated that host genetic variation significantly influenced the phyllosphere resistomes. Wheat genotypes exhibiting high phyllosphere ARGs were linked to elevated Pseudomonas populations, along with increased abundances of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation genes. Further analysis of 350 Pseudomonas spp. genomes from diverse habitats at a global scale revealed that nearly all strains possess multiple ARGs, virulence factor genes (VFGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) on their genomes, albeit with lower nucleotide diversity compared to other species. These findings suggested that the proliferation of Pseudomonas spp. in the phyllosphere significantly contributed to antibiotic resistance. We further observed direct links between the upregulated leaf metabolite DIMBOA-Glc, Pseudomonas spp., and enrichment of phyllosphere ARGs, which were corroborated by microcosm experiments demonstrating that DIMBOA-Glc significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Pseudomonas species. Overall, alterations in leaf metabolites resulting from genetic variation throughout plant evolution may drive the development of highly specialized microbial communities capable of enriching phyllosphere ARGs. This study enhances our understanding of how plants actively shape microbial communities and clarifies the impact of host genetic variation on the plant resistomes.

## Diversity, composition and potential roles of sedimentary microbial communities in different coastal substrates around subtropical Okinawa Island, Japan.
 31.07.2024, _K Hamamoto, M Mizuyama, M Nishijima, A Maeda, K Gibu, A Poliseno, A Iguchi, JD Reimer_


Marine benthic prokaryotic communities play crucial roles in material recycling within coastal environments, including coral reefs. Coastal sedimentary microbiomes are particularly important as potential reservoirs of symbiotic, beneficial, and pathogenic bacteria in coral reef environments, and therefore presumably play a core role in local ecosystem functioning. However, there is a lack of studies comparing different environments with multiple sites on the island scale, particularly studies focusing on prokaryotic communities, as previous investigations have focused mainly on a single site or on specific environmental conditions. In our study, we collected coastal sediments from seven sites around Okinawa Island, Japan, including three different benthic types; sandy bottoms, seagrass meadows, and hard substratum with living scleractinian corals. We then used metabarcoding to identify prokaryotic compositions and estimate enzymes encoded by genes to infer their functions.
