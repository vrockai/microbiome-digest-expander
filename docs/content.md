## Changes in the gut microbiome of patients with esophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis based on 16S gene sequencing technology.
 06.07.2024, _J Deng, Y Huang, K Yu, H Luo, D Zhou, D Li_


Esophageal cancer (EC) possesses a high degree of malignancy and exhibits poor therapeutic outcomes and prognosis. However, its pathogenesis remains unclear. With the development of macrogene sequencing technology, changes in the intestinal flora have been found to be highly related to the development of EC, although discrepancies and controversies remain in this research area.

## Environmental, socioeconomic, and health factors associated with gut microbiome species and strains in isolated Honduras villages.
 05.07.2024, _SV Shridhar, F Beghini, M Alexander, A Singh, RM Juárez, IL Brito, NA Christakis_


Despite a growing interest in the gut microbiome of non-industrialized countries, data linking deeply sequenced microbiomes from such settings to diverse host phenotypes and situational factors remain uncommon. Using metagenomic data from a community-based cohort of 1,871 people from 19 isolated villages in the Mesoamerican highlands of western Honduras, we report associations between bacterial species and human phenotypes and factors. Among them, socioeconomic factors account for 51.44% of the total associations. Meta-analysis of species-level profiles across several datasets identified several species associated with body mass index, consistent with previous findings. Furthermore, the inclusion of strain-phylogenetic information modifies the overall relationship between the gut microbiome and the phenotypes, especially for some factors like household wealth (e.g., wealthier individuals harbor different strains of Eubacterium rectale). Our analysis suggests a role that gut microbiome surveillance can play in understanding broad features of individual and public health.

Schizophrenia is a severe, complex and long-term psychiatric disorder with unclear etiology. Gut microbes influence the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis. Consequently, investigations of the relationship between gut microbes and schizophrenia are warranted. This study involved 29 patients with schizophrenia and 30 age-matched normal controls. After 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed microbial diversity, composition, and function. According to 16S rRNA and metagenomic gene sequencing results, patients with schizophrenia had higher abundances of Clostridium and Megasphaera. Functional analysis showed that sphingolipid, phosphonates and phosphinates, as well as glutamine metabolism were associated with the occurrence and development of schizophrenia. Our data suggest that the gut microbiota exerts an effect on patients with schizophrenia, providing valuable insights into the potential regulation of in the context of this disorder.

The impact of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on maternal or infant microbiome trajectory remains poorly understood. Utilizing large-scale longitudinal fecal samples from 264 mother-baby dyads, we present the gut microbiome trajectory of the mothers throughout pregnancy and infants during the first year of life. GDM mothers had a distinct microbiome diversity and composition during the gestation period. GDM leaves fingerprints on the infant's gut microbiome, which are confounded by delivery mode. Further, Clostridium species positively correlate with a larger head circumference at month 12 in male offspring but not females. The gut microbiome of GDM mothers with male fetuses displays depleted gut-brain modules, including acetate synthesis I and degradation and glutamate synthesis II. The gut microbiome of female infants of GDM mothers has higher histamine degradation and dopamine degradation. Together, our integrative analysis indicates that GDM affects maternal and infant gut composition, which is associated with sexually dimorphic infant head growth.

Endometrial cancer is a multifactorial disease with inflammatory, metabolic and potentially microbial cues involved in disease pathogenesis. The endometrial cancer microbiome has been poorly characterised so far and studies have often overestimated bacterial biomass due to lack of integration of appropriate contamination controls. There is also a scarcity of evidence on the functionality of microbial microenvironments in endometrial cancer. This work addresses that knowledge gap by interrogating the genuine, contamination-free microbial signatures in the female genital tract and rectum of women with endometrial cancer and the mechanistic role of microbiome on carcinogenic processes.

## Facile hydrothermal synthesis of manganese sulfide nanoelectrocatalyst for high sensitive detection of Bisphenol A in food and eco-samples.
 24.06.2022, _M Annalakshmi, TST Balamurugan, S Kumaravel, SM Chen, JL He_


_Benzhydryl Compounds, Ecosystem, Manganese Compounds, Phenols, Sulfides_
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a renowned plasticizer, and a key component of various plastics, resins, and food packaging materials. However, BPA have been identified as an endocrine disruption compound and cause severe consequences such as infertility, diabetic, obesity, carcinoma, and possess high risk of exposure in aquatic ecosystem. To this, we crafted an ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor based on the manganese sulfide nanoparticles (MnS NPs) catalyzed electrochemical oxidation of BPA, and its eventual application in rapid screening of BPA contamination. The physiochemical characteristics and electrocatalytic performance of the MnS nanocatalyst have been well studied and utilized in the fabrication of MnS/GCE based BPA sensor. The fabricated BPA sensor has shown a broad dynamic range (20 nM-2.15 mM), lower detection limits (6.52 nM) and promising towards rapid screening of BPA contaminations in food and environmental samples under mimicked real-world conditions with excellent accuracy and precision.

## Gut microbiota-lncRNA/circRNA crosstalk: implications for different diseases.
 05.07.2024, _L Zhang, X Li, H Gao, W Chang, P Li_


The gut microbiota features an abundance of diverse microorganisms and represents an important component of human physiology and metabolic homeostasis, indicating their roles in a wide array of physiological and pathological processes in the host. Maintaining balance in the gut microbiota is critical for normal functionality as microbial dysbiosis can lead to the occurrence and development of diseases through various mechanisms. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that perform important regulatory functions for many processes. Furthermore, the gut microbiota and lncRNAs/circRNAs are known to interact in a range of both physiological and pathological activities. In this article, we review existing research relevant to the interaction between the gut microbiota and lncRNAs/circRNAs and investigate the role of their crosstalk in the pathogenesis of different diseases. Studies have shown that, the gut microbiota can target lncRNAs ENO1-IT1, BFAL1, and LINC00152 to regulate colorectal cancer development via various signaling pathways. In addition, the gut microbiota can influence mental diseases and lung tumor metastasis by modulating circRNAs such as circNF1-419, circ_0001239, circHIPK2 and mmu_circ_0000730. These findings provide a theoretical basis for disease prevention and treatment and suggest that gut microbiota-lncRNA/circRNA crosstalk has high clinical value.

## The role of gut microbiota, exosomes, and their interaction in the pathogenesis of ALD.
 05.07.2024, _Z Cheng, L Yang, H Chu_


The liver disorders caused by alcohol abuse are termed alcoholic-related liver disease (ALD), including alcoholic steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis alcoholic hepatitis, and alcoholic cirrhosis, posing a significant threat to human health. Currently, ALD pathogenesis has not been completely clarified, which is likely to be related to the direct damage caused by alcohol and its metabolic products, oxidative stress, gut dysbiosis, and exosomes.

## Integrating host and microbiome biology using holo-omics.
 04.07.2024, _CM Kobel, J Merkesvik, IMT Burgos, W Lai, O Øyås, PB Pope, TR Hvidsten, VTE Aho_


Holo-omics is the use of omics data to study a host and its inherent microbiomes - a biological system known as a "holobiont". A microbiome that exists in such a space often encounters habitat stability and in return provides metabolic capacities that can benefit their host. Here we present an overview of beneficial host-microbiome systems and propose and discuss several methodological frameworks that can be used to investigate the intricacies of the many as yet undefined host-microbiome interactions that influence holobiont homeostasis. While this is an emerging field, we anticipate that ongoing methodological advancements will enhance the biological resolution that is necessary to improve our understanding of host-microbiome interplay to make meaningful interpretations and biotechnological applications.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and fecal virome transplantation (FVT, sterile filtrated donor feces) have been effective in treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections, possibly through bacteriophage-mediated modulation of the gut microbiome. However, challenges like donor variability, costly screening, coupled with concerns over pathogen transfer (incl. eukaryotic viruses) with FMT or FVT hinder their wider clinical application in treating less acute diseases.

## DeepPIG: deep neural network architecture with pairwise connected layers and stochastic gates using knockoff frameworks for feature selection.
 09.07.2024, _E Oh, H Lee_


Selecting relevant feature subsets is essential for machine learning applications. Among the feature selection techniques, the knockoff filter procedure proposes a unique framework that minimizes false discovery rates (FDR). However, employing a deep neural network architecture for a knockoff filter framework requires higher detection power. Using the knockoff filter framework, we present a Deep neural network with PaIrwise connected layers integrated with stochastic Gates (DeepPIG) for the feature selection model. DeepPIG exhibited better detection power in synthetic data than the baseline and recent models such as Deep feature selection using Paired-Input Nonlinear Knockoffs (DeepPINK), Stochastic Gates (STG), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) while not violating the preselected FDR level, especially when the signal of the features were weak. The selected features determined by DeepPIG demonstrated superior classification performance compared with the baseline model in real-world data analyses, including the prediction of certain cancer prognosis and classification tasks using microbiome and single-cell datasets. In conclusion, DeepPIG is a robust feature selection approach even when the signals of features are weak. Source code is available at https://github.com/DMCB-GIST/DeepPIG .
