## Effects of dietary rosemary extract supplementation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant capacity, intestinal morphology and microbiota of weaning pigs.
 09.08.2021, _M Yang, Y Yin, F Wang, X Bao, L Long, B Tan, Y Yin, J Chen_


Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) extract (RE) has multiple pharmacological and biological activities, including use as a food additive and medicine. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary RE supplementation on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant capacity, intestinal morphology and microbiota of weaning piglets. A total of 192 crossbred weaned piglets [Duroc × (Large White × Landrace)] (initial body weight = 6.65 ± 0.33 kg, weaned days = 23 ± 1 d) were group housed (six pigs per pen; n = 8 pens/treatment). Pigs were fed a corn-soybean meal-based control diet or the basal diet supplemented with 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg RE. Pigs were allowed ad libitum access to fed for 21-d. The growth performance and apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients, and intestinal morphology and antioxidant status were evaluated. The components of the microbial microflora were also determined in the cecal samples. Compared with the control, dietary supplementation with RE increased the final body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake (linear, P = 0.038, 0.016, and 0.009, respectively), and decreased the diarrhea ratio in piglets (linear, P &lt; 0.05). The digestibility of crude protein (linear, P = 0.034) and gross energy (linear, P = 0.046) increased with treatment with RE. Piglets fed RE showed longer villus height (linear, P = 0.037 and 0.028, respectively) and villus height/crypt depth (linear, P = 0.004 and 0.012; quadratic, P = 0.023 and 0.036, respectively) in the jejunum and ileum, in addition to a lesser crypt depth in the jejunum (linear, P = 0.019) and ileum (quadratic, P = 0.042). The addition of RE increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (linear, P = 0.035 and 0.008 respectively) and glutathione peroxidase activity (linear, P = 0.027 and 0.039 respectively), and decreased the content of malondialdehyde (linear, P = 0.041 and 0.013; quadratic, P = 0.023 and 0.005 respectively) in the serum and liver. Dietary RE supplementation, compared with the control, increased the number of Bifidobacterium (linear, P = 0.034) and Bacteroidetes (linear, P = 0.029), while decreased Escherichia coli (linear, P = 0.008; quadratic, P = 0.014) in the cecal contents. Thus, dietary RE supplementation can improve growth performance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant capacity, intestinal morphology and the microbiota in weaned piglets, and 200 mg/kg may be considered the optimum dosage.

## Changes in the gut microbiota: a possible factor influencing peripheral blood immune indexes in non-obese diabetic mice.
 09.08.2021, _Y Wu, Q You, J Fei, J Wu_


Intestinal flora changes were found in patients and animals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, few studies have provided any explicit clues of changes in highly disease related commensal microbiota before disease onset and their relationships with disordered peripheral immune cells. We conducted 16S rRNA microbiota analysis of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice from weaning to diabetes onset to identify highly disease related microbes and performed Spearman correlation analysis between anomalous flora and peripheral immune cells. We found NOD mice had increased exclusive bacteria and decreased community richness or diversity, besides, with the features of decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes and increased abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria or Deferribacteres and remarkable fluctuations of genus relative abundance. Furthermore, kinds of highly T1D related genus and their strong correlations with peripheral immune cells, especially neutrophils, were discovered. Microbial changes in NOD mice differed from that of ICR mice and highly disease associated microbes have strong correlations with the peripheral neutrophil ratio, which provide evidence that neutrophils are possibly involved in the pathogenesis of T1D.

## Fishing for the Virome of Tropical Tuna.
 10.08.2021, _E Gadoin, C Desnues, S Monteil-Bouchard, T Bouvier, JC Auguet, E Roque d'Orbcastel, Y Bettarel_


While planktonic viruses have received much attention in recent decades, knowledge of the virome of marine organisms, especially fish, still remains rudimentary. This is notably the case with tuna, which are among the most consumed fish worldwide and represent considerable economic, social and nutritional value. Yet the composition of the tuna virome and its biological and environmental determinants remain unknown. To begin to address this gap, we investigated the taxonomic diversity of viral communities inhabiting the skin mucus, gut and liver of two major tropical tuna species (skipjack and yellowfin) in individuals fished in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. While we found significant differences in the virome composition between the organs, this was totally independent of the tuna species or sex. The tuna virome was mainly dominated by eukaryotic viruses in the digestive organs (gut and liver), while bacteriophages were predominant in the mucus. We observed the presence of specific viral families in each organ, some previously identified as fish or human pathogens (e.g., Iridoviridae, Parvoviridae, Alloherpesviridae, Papillomaviridae). Interestingly, we also detected a 'core virome' that was shared by all the organs and was mainly composed of Caudovirales, Microviridae and Circoviridae. These results show that tuna host a mosaic of viral niches, whose establishment, role and circulation remain to be elucidated.

## Colonization by the Red Imported Fire Ant, Solenopsis invicta, Modifies Soil Bacterial Communities.
 09.08.2021, _NV Travanty, EL Vargo, CS Apperson, L Ponnusamy_


The long-standing association between insects and microorganisms has been especially crucial to the evolutionary and ecological success of social insect groups. Notably, research on the interaction of the two social forms (monogyne and polygyne) of the red imported fire ant (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta Buren, with microbes in its soil habitat is presently limited. In this study, we characterized bacterial microbiomes associated with RIFA nest soils and native (RIFA-negative) soils to better understand the effects of colonization of RIFA on soil microbial communities. Bacterial community fingerprints of 16S rRNA amplicons using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed significant differences in the structure of the bacterial communities between RIFA-positive and RIFA-negative soils at 0 and 10 cm depths. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons provided fine-scale analysis to test for effects of RIFA colonization, RIFA social form, and soil depth on the composition of the bacterial microbiomes of the soil and RIFA workers. Our results showed the bacterial community structure of RIFA-colonized soils to be significantly different from native soil communities and to evidence elevated abundances of several taxa, including Actinobacteria. Colony social form was not found to be a significant factor in nest or RIFA worker microbiome compositions. RIFA workers and nest soils were determined to have markedly different bacterial communities, with RIFA worker microbiomes being characterized by high abundances of a Bartonella-like endosymbiont and Entomoplasmataceae. Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed the Bartonella sp. to be a novel bacterium.
