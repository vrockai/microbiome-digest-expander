Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with persistent oral microbial dysbiosis. The human β-glucuronidase (GUS) degrades constituents of the periodontium and is used as a biomarker for periodontitis severity. However, the human microbiome also encodes GUS enzymes, and the role of these factors in periodontal disease is poorly understood. Here, we define the 53 unique GUSs in the human oral microbiome and examine diverse GUS orthologs from periodontitis-associated pathogens. Oral bacterial GUS enzymes are more efficient polysaccharide degraders and processers of biomarker substrates than the human enzyme, particularly at pHs associated with disease progression. Using a microbial GUS-selective inhibitor, we show that GUS activity is reduced in clinical samples obtained from individuals with untreated periodontitis and that the degree of inhibition correlates with disease severity. Together, these results establish oral GUS activity as a biomarker that captures both host and microbial contributions to periodontitis, facilitating more efficient clinical monitoring and treatment paradigms for this common inflammatory disease.

## Vaginal epithelial dysfunction is mediated by the microbiome, metabolome, and mTOR signaling.
 07.05.2023, _AR Berard, DK Brubaker, K Birse, A Lamont, RD Mackelprang, L Noël-Romas, M Perner, X Hou, E Irungu, N Mugo, S Knodel, TR Muwonge, E Katabira, SM Hughes, C Levy, FL Calienes, DA Lauffenburger, JM Baeten, C Celum, F Hladik, J Lingappa, AD Burgener_


Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by depletion of Lactobacillus and overgrowth of anaerobic and facultative bacteria, leading to increased mucosal inflammation, epithelial disruption, and poor reproductive health outcomes. However, the molecular mediators contributing to vaginal epithelial dysfunction are poorly understood. Here we utilize proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses to characterize biological features underlying BV in 405 African women and explore functional mechanisms in vitro. We identify five major vaginal microbiome groups: L. crispatus (21%), L. iners (18%), Lactobacillus (9%), Gardnerella (30%), and polymicrobial (22%). Using multi-omics we show that BV-associated epithelial disruption and mucosal inflammation link to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and associate with Gardnerella, M. mulieris, and specific metabolites including imidazole propionate. Experiments in vitro confirm that type strain G. vaginalis and M. mulieris supernatants and imidazole propionate directly affect epithelial barrier function and activation of mTOR pathways. These results find that the microbiome-mTOR axis is a central feature of epithelial dysfunction in BV.

This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of intestinal microbiota in children with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) under 3 years old. Fresh feces were collected from 54 children with HFMD and 30 healthy children. All of them were &lt;3 years old. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA amplicons was performed. Between the 2 groups, the richness, diversity, and structure of the intestinal microbiota were analyzed by α-diversity and β-diversity. Linear discriminant analysis and LEfSe analyses were used to compare different bacterial classifications. The sex and age of the children in the 2 groups were not statistically significant (P = .92 and P = .98, respectively). Compared to healthy children, the Shannon index, Ace index, and Chao index were lower in children with HFMD (P = .027, P = .012, and P = .012, respectively). Based on the weighted or unweighted UniFrac distance analysis, the structure of the intestinal microbiota in HFMD was also significantly changed (P = .002 and P &lt; .001, respectively). Linear discriminant analysis and LEfSe analysis showed that the changes of key bacteria were manifested as a decrease in Prevotella and Clostridium_XIVa (P &lt; .001 and P &lt; .001, respectively), while Escherichia and Bifidobacterium increased (P = .025 and P = .001, respectively). Children with HFMD under 3 years of age have intestinal microbiota disorder and show a decrease in diversity and richness. The decrease in the abundance of Prevotella and Clostridium, which can produce short-chain fatty acids, is also one of the characteristics of the change. These results can offer a theoretical foundation for the pathogenesis and microecological treatment of HFMD in infants.

The upper respiratory tract is an obliged pathway for respiratory pathogens and a healthy microbiota may support the host's mucosal immunity preventing infection. We analyzed the nasopharyngeal microbiome in tuberculosis household contacts (HHCs) and its association with latent tuberculosis infection (TBI). A prospective cohort of HHCs was established and latent TBI status was assessed by serial interferon-γ release assay (IGRA). Nasopharyngeal swabs collected at baseline were processed for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The 82 participants included in the analysis were classified as: (a) non-TBI [IGRA negative at baseline and follow-up, no active TB (n = 31)], (b) pre-TBI [IGRA negative at baseline but converted to IGRA positive or developed active TB at follow-up (n = 16)], and (c) TBI [IGRA positive at enrollment (n = 35)]. Predominant phyla were Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidota. TBI group had a lower alpha diversity compared to non-TBI (padj = 0.04) and pre-TBI (padj = 0.04). Only TBI and non-TBI had beta diversity differences (padj = 0.035). Core microbiomes' had unique genera, and genus showed differential abundance among groups. HHCs with established latent TBI showed reduced nasopharyngeal microbial diversity with distinctive taxonomical composition. Whether a pre-existing microbiome feature favors, are a consequence, or protects against Mycobacterium tuberculosis needs further investigation.

## Stress, inflammation, microbiome and depression.
 06.05.2023, _EM Medina-Rodriguez, AA Cruz, JC De Abreu, E Beurel_


Psychiatric disorders are mental illnesses involving changes in mood, cognition and behavior. Their prevalence has rapidly increased in the last decades. One of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders is major depressive disorder (MDD), a debilitating disease lacking efficient treatments. Increasing evidence shows that microbial and immunological changes contribute to the pathophysiology of depression and both are modulated by stress. This bidirectional relationship constitutes the brain-gut axis involving various neuroendocrine, immunological, neuroenterocrine and autonomic pathways. The present review covers the most recent findings on the relationships between stress, the gut microbiome and the inflammatory response and their contribution to depression.

## Exploration of Verticillins in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer and Evaluation of Multiple Formulations in Preclinical In Vitro and In Vivo Models.
 08.05.2023, _EN Kaweesa, JM Bazioli, HC Pierre, DD Lantvit, SK Kulp, KL Hill, MA Phelps, CC Coss, JR Fuchs, CJ Pearce, NH Oberlies, JE Burdette_


Verticillins are epipolythiodioxopiperazine alkaloids isolated from a fungus with nanomolar anti-tumor activity in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). HGSOC is the fifth leading cause of death in women, and natural products continue to be an inspiration for new drug entities to help tackle chemoresistance. Verticillin D was recently found in a new fungal strain and compared to verticillin A. Both compounds exhibited nanomolar cytotoxic activity against OVCAR4 and OVCAR8 HGSOC cell lines, significantly reduced 2D foci and 3D spheroids, and induced apoptosis. In addition, verticillin A and verticillin D reduced tumor burden in vivo using OVCAR8 xenografts in the peritoneal space as a model. Unfortunately, mice treated with verticillin D displayed signs of liver toxicity. Tolerability studies to optimize verticillin A formulation for in vivo delivery were performed and compared to a semi-synthetic succinate version of verticillin A to monitor bioavailability in athymic nude females. Formulation of verticillins achieved tolerable drug delivery. Thus, formulation studies are effective at improving tolerability and demonstrating efficacy for verticillins.

## L-Fucose is involved in human-gut microbiome interactions.
 06.05.2023, _J Kim, YS Jin, KH Kim_


L-Fucose is one of the key metabolites in human-gut microbiome interactions. It is continuously synthesized by humans in the form of fucosylated glycans and fucosyl-oligosaccharides and delivered into the gut throughout their lifetime. Gut microorganisms metabolize L-fucose and produce short-chain fatty acids, which are absorbed by epithelial cells and used as energy sources or signaling molecules. Recent studies have revealed that the carbon flux in L-fucose metabolism by gut microorganisms is distinct from that in other sugar metabolisms because of cofactor imbalance and low efficiencies in energy synthesis of L-fucose metabolism. The large amounts of short-chain fatty acids produced during microbial L-fucose metabolism are used by epithelial cells to recover most of the energy used up during L-fucose synthesis. In this review, we present a detailed overview of microbial L-fucose metabolism and a potential solution for disease treatment and prevention using genetically engineered probiotics that modulate fucose metabolism. Our review contributes to the understanding of human-gut microbiome interactions through L-fucose metabolism. KEY POINTS: • Fucose-metabolizing microorganisms produce large amounts of short-chain fatty acids • Fucose metabolism differs from other sugar metabolisms by cofactor imbalance • Modulating fucose metabolism is the key to control host-gut microbiome interactions.

Some insects can degrade both natural and synthetic plastic polymers, their host and gut microbes play crucial roles in this process. However, there is still a scientific gap in understanding how the insect adapted to the polystyrene (PS) diet from natural feed. In this study, we analyzed diet consumption, gut microbiota responses, and metabolic pathways of Tenebrio molitor larvae exposed to PS and corn straw (CS).

## The good, the bad, and the phosphate: regulation of beneficial and detrimental plant-microbe interactions by the plant phosphate status.
 05.05.2023, _M Paries, C Gutjahr_


Phosphate (Pi ) is indispensable for life on this planet. However, for sessile land plants it is poorly accessible. Therefore, plants have developed a variety of strategies for enhanced acquisition and recycling of Pi . The mechanisms to cope with Pi limitation as well as direct uptake of Pi from the substrate via the root epidermis are regulated by a conserved Pi starvation response (PSR) system based on a family of key transcription factors (TFs) and their inhibitors. Furthermore, plants obtain Pi indirectly through symbiosis with mycorrhiza fungi, which employ their extensive hyphal network to drastically increase the soil volume that can be explored by plants for Pi . Besides mycorrhizal symbiosis, there is also a variety of other interactions with epiphytic, endophytic, and rhizospheric microbes that can indirectly or directly influence plant Pi uptake. It was recently discovered that the PSR pathway is involved in the regulation of genes that promote formation and maintenance of AM symbiosis. Furthermore, the PSR system influences plant immunity and can also be a target of microbial manipulation. It is known for decades that the nutritional status of plants influences the outcome of plant-microbe interactions. The first molecular explanations for these observations are now emerging.
