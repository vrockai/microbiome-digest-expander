## Nitrogen Deficiency-induced Bacterial Community Shifts in Soybean Roots.
 08.07.2021, _W Yazaki, T Shimasaki, Y Aoki, S Masuda, A Shibata, W Suda, K Shirasu, K Yazaki, A Sugiyama_


Nitrogen deficiency affects soybean growth and physiology, such as symbiosis with rhizobia; however, its effects on the bacterial composition of the soybean root microbiota remain unclear. A bacterial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed nitrogen deficiency-induced bacterial community shifts in soybean roots with the marked enrichment of Methylobacteriaceae. The abundance of Methylobacteriaceae was low in the roots of field-grown soybean without symptoms of nitrogen deficiency. Although Methylobacteriaceae isolated from soybean roots under nitrogen deficiency did not promote growth or nodulation when inoculated into soybean roots, these results indicate that the enrichment of Methylobacteriaceae in soybean roots is triggered by nitrogen-deficiency stress.

## Metabolic interactions in beneficial microbe recruitment by plants.
 08.07.2021, _D Abedini, S Jaupitre, H Bouwmeester, L Dong_


During millions of years of evolution, land plants and microorganisms have established elaborate partnerships. Microbes play essential roles in plant fitness and help plants cope with environmental challenges. Vice versa, plants provide the microbes with a niche and food. In the soil, a complex network of interactions mediated by metabolic signals drives the relationship between plants and microbes. Here, we review the roles of metabolic signaling in the plant-microbiome interaction. We discuss how plant-produced small molecules are involved in the recruitment of the microbiome. Also the microbial partners in this relationship use small molecules, such as quorum sensing molecules and volatiles for intra-species and inter-species communication. We give an overview of the regulation of the biosynthesis, secretion and perception of both plant and microbial small molecules and discuss the examples of biotechnological approaches to engineer the plant-microbiome interaction by targeting these metabolic dialogues. Ultimately, an improved understanding of the plant-microbiome interaction and engineering possibilities will pave the way to a more sustainable agriculture.
