 10.09.2023, _J de la Cuesta-Zuluaga, KE Huus, ND Youngblut, JS Escobar, RE Ley_


Obesity (OB) and cardiometabolic disease are major public health issues linked to changes in the gut microbiome. OB and poor cardiometabolic health status (CHS) are often comorbid, which hinders efforts to identify components of the microbiome uniquely linked to either one. Here, we used a deeply phenotyped cohort of 408 adults from Colombia, including subjects with OB, unhealthy CHS, or both, to validate previously reported features of gut microbiome function and diversity independently correlated with OB or CHS using fecal metagenomes. OB was defined by body mass index, waist circumference, and body fat; CHS as healthy or unhealthy according to blood biochemistry and anthropometric data. We found that OB, more so than metabolic status, drove associations with gut microbiome structure and functions. The microbiome of obese individuals with and without co-existing unhealthy CHS was characterized by reduced metagenomic diversity, reduced fermentative potential and elevated capacity to respond to oxidative stress and produce bacterial antigens. Disease-linked features were correlated with increased host blood pressure and inflammatory markers, and were mainly contributed by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Our results link OB with a microbiome able to tolerate an inflammatory and oxygenated gut state, and suggest that OB is the main driver of microbiome functional differences when poor CHS is a comorbidity.

_Animals, Mice, Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Resistant Starch, Microbiota, Triglycerides_
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic dysfunction for which effective interventions are lacking. To investigate the effects of resistant starch (RS) as a microbiota-directed dietary supplement for NAFLD treatment, we coupled a 4-month randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in individuals with NAFLD (ChiCTR-IOR-15007519) with metagenomics and metabolomics analysis. Relative to the control (n = 97), the RS intervention (n = 99) resulted in a 9.08% absolute reduction of intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTC), which was 5.89% after adjusting for weight loss. Serum branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and gut microbial species, in particular Bacteroides stercoris, significantly correlated with IHTC and liver enzymes and were reduced by RS. Multi-omics integrative analyses revealed the interplay among gut microbiota changes, BCAA availability, and hepatic steatosis, with causality supported by fecal microbiota transplantation and monocolonization in mice. Thus, RS dietary supplementation might be a strategy for managing NAFLD by altering gut microbiota composition and functionality.

Gut microbiota is an emerging editable cardiovascular risk factor. We aim to investigate gut and coronary plaque microbiota, using fecal samples and angioplasty balloons from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) and control subjects. We examined bacterial communities in gut and coronary plaques by 16S rRNA sequencing and we performed droplet digital PCR analysis to investigate the gut relative abundance of the bacterial genes CutC/CntA involved in trimethylamine N-oxide synthesis. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) at the genus and species levels displayed gut enrichment in Streptococcus, Granulicatella and P. distasonis in ACS compared with CCS and controls; Roseburia, C. aerofaciens and F. prausnitzii were more abundant in controls than in patients. Principal component analysis (PCA) of 41 differentially abundant gut taxa showed a clustering of the three groups. In coronary plaque, LEfSe at the genus level revealed an enrichment of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus in ACS, and Paracoccus in CCS, whereas PCA of 15 differentially abundant plaque taxa exhibited clustering of ACS and CCS patients. CutC and CntA genes were more abundant in ACS and CCS than in controls while no significant difference emerged between ACS and CCS. Our results indicate that ACS and CCS exhibit a different gut and plaque microbial signature, suggesting a possible role of these microbiotas in coronary plaque instability.

Orlistat, an anti-obesity agent, inhibits the metabolism and absorption of dietary fat by inactivating pancreatic lipase in the gut. The effect of orlistat on the gut microbiota of Japanese individuals with obesity is unknown. This study aimed to explore the effects of orlistat on the gut microbiota and fatty acid metabolism of Japanese individuals with obesity. Fourteen subjects with visceral fat obesity (waist circumference ≥85 cm) took orlistat orally at a dose of 60 mg, 3 times a day for 8 weeks. Body weight; waist circumference; visceral fat area; levels of short-chain fatty acids, gut microbiota, fatty acid metabolites in the feces, and gastrointestinal hormones; and adverse events were evaluated. Body weight, waist circumference, and blood leptin concentrations were significantly lower after orlistat treatment (mean ± standard deviation, 77.8 ± 9.1 kg; 91.9 ± 8.7 cm; and 4546 ± 3211 pg/mL, respectively) compared with before treatment (79.4 ± 9.0 kg; 94.4 ± 8.0 cm; and 5881 ± 3526 pg/mL, respectively). Significant increases in fecal levels of fatty acid metabolites (10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid, 10-oxo-cis-12-octadecenoic acid, and 10-oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic acid) were detected. Meanwhile, no significant changes were found in abdominal computed tomography parameters, blood marker levels, or short-chain fatty acid levels in the feces. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that some study subjects had decreased abundance of Firmicutes, increased abundance of Bacteroidetes, and increased α-diversity indices (Chao1 and ACE) after 8 weeks of treatment. The levels of Lactobacillus genus and Lactobacillus gasseri were significantly higher after 8 weeks of treatment. None of the subjects discontinued treatment or experienced severe adverse events. This study suggested that orlistat might alter gut microbiota composition and affect the body through fatty acid metabolites produced by the modified gut bacteria.

## Metabolic network construction reveals probiotic-specific alterations in the metabolic activity of a synthetic small intestinal community.
 05.09.2023, _J Jansma, AC Chatziioannou, K Castricum, S van Hemert, S El Aidy_


The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and probiotics have emerged as a promising microbiota-targeted therapy for improving human health. However, the molecular mechanisms of probiotics action in general and the targeting of small intestinal microbiota by probiotics are not well understood. To address this, we constructed a synthetic community of three species, which resembles the upper small intestinal microbiota. Our results indicate that probiotic supplementation can directly affect the metabolism of the community, resulting in colonization resistance in a probiotic-specific manner. Supplementation with Streptococcus thermophilus led to increased lactate production and a decrease in pH, while Lactobacillus casei supplementation increased the resistance to perturbations and nutrient utilization without affecting lactate production or pH. Additionally, when combined with kynurenine, Lactobacillus casei enhanced the kynurenine pathway metabolism resulting in elevated kynurenic acid levels and possibly indirect colonization resistance. Overall, our study reveals how selecting probiotics with distinct functional capacities can unlock the full potential of microbiota-targeted therapies.IMPORTANCEThe development of probiotic therapies targeted at the small intestinal microbiota represents a significant advancement in the field of probiotic interventions. This region poses unique opportunities due to its low number of gut microbiota, along with the presence of heightened immune and metabolic host responses. However, progress in this area has been hindered by a lack of detailed understanding regarding the molecular mechanisms through which probiotics exert their effects in the small intestine. Our study, utilizing a synthetic community of three small intestinal bacterial strains and the addition of two different probiotic species, and kynurenine as a representative dietary or endogenously produced compound, highlights the importance of selecting probiotic species with diverse genetic capabilities that complement the functional capacity of the resident microbiota, or alternatively, constructing a multispecies formula. This approach holds great promise for the development of effective probiotic therapies and underscores the need to consider the functional capacity of probiotic species when designing interventions.

## Differential dependence on microbiota of IL-23/IL-22-dependent gene expression between the small- and large-intestinal epithelia.
 08.09.2023, _A Nakatani, R Okumura, A Ishibashi, S Okamoto, K Sakaki, Y Ito, D Okuzaki, H Inohara, K Takeda_


In the intestine, interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-22 from immune cells in the lamina propria contribute to maintenance of the gut epithelial barrier through the induction of antimicrobial production and the promotion of epithelial cell proliferation. Several previous studies suggested that some of the functions of the IL-23/IL-22 axis on intestinal epithelial cells are shared between the small and large intestines. However, the similarities and differences of the IL-23/IL-22 axis on epithelial cells between these two anatomical sites remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the gene expression of intestinal epithelial cells in the ileum and colon of germ-free, Il23-/- , and Il22-/- mice by RNA-sequencing. We found that while the IL-23/IL-22 axis is largely dependent on gut microbiota in the small intestine, it is much less dependent on it in the large intestine. In addition, the negative regulation of lipid metabolism in the epithelial cells by IL-23 and IL-22 in the small intestine was revealed, whereas the positive regulation of epithelial cell proliferation by IL-23 and IL-22 in the large intestine was highlighted. These findings shed light on the intestinal site-specific role of the IL-23/IL-22 axis in maintaining the physiological functions of intestinal epithelial cells.

## Identification of microbial markers associated with lung cancer based on multi-cohort 16 s rRNA analyses: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
 07.09.2023, _W Han, N Wang, M Han, X Liu, T Sun, J Xu_


The relationship between commensal microbiota and lung cancer (LC) has been studied extensively. However, developing replicable microbiological markers for early LC diagnosis across multiple populations has remained challenging. Current studies are limited to a single region, single LC subtype, and small sample size. Therefore, we aimed to perform the first large-scale meta-analysis for identifying micro biomarkers for LC screening by integrating gut and respiratory samples from multiple studies and building a machine-learning classifier.

## Targeting microbial quorum sensing: the next frontier to hinder bacterial driven gastrointestinal infections.
 10.09.2023, _Y Su, T Ding_


Bacteria synchronize social behaviors via a cell-cell communication and interaction mechanism termed as quorum sensing (QS). QS has been extensively studied in monocultures and proved to be intensively involved in bacterial virulence and infection. Despite the role QS plays in pathogens during laboratory engineered infections has been proved, the potential functions of QS related to pathogenesis in context of microbial consortia remain poorly understood. In this review, we summarize the basic molecular mechanisms of QS, primarily focusing on pathogenic microbes driving gastrointestinal (GI) infections. We further discuss how GI pathogens disequilibrate the homeostasis of the indigenous microbial consortia, rebuild a realm dominated by pathogens, and interact with host under worsening infectious conditions via pathogen-biased QS signaling. Additionally, we present recent applications and main challenges of manipulating QS network in microbial consortia with the goal of better understanding GI bacterial sociality and facilitating novel therapies targeting bacterial infections.

## Illuminating the oral microbiome and its host interactions: recent Advancements in omics and bioinformatics technologies in the context of oral microbiome research.
 05.09.2023, _JL Baker_


The oral microbiota has an enormous impact on human health, with oral dysbiosis now linked to many oral and systemic diseases. Recent advancements in sequencing, mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, computational biology, and machine learning are revolutionizing oral microbiome research, enabling analysis at an unprecedented scale and level of resolution using omics approaches. This review contains a comprehensive perspective of the current state-of-the-art tools available to perform genomics, metagenomics, phylogenomics, pangenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and multi-omics analysis on (all) microbiomes, and then provides examples of how the techniques have been applied to research of the oral microbiome, specifically. Key findings of these studies and remaining challenges for the field are highlighted. Although the methods discussed here are placed in the context of their contributions to oral microbiome research specifically, they are pertinent to the study of any microbiome, and the intended audience of this includes researchers would simply like to get an introduction to microbial omics and/or an update on the latest omics methods. Continued research of the oral microbiota using omics approaches is crucial and will lead to dramatic improvements in human health, longevity, and quality of life.

## Association between primary Sjögren's syndrome and gut microbiota disruption: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
 08.09.2023, _Y Shen, X Yu, Q Wang, X Yao, D Lu, D Zhou, X Wang_


Evidence of gut microbiota disruption for numerous autoimmune diseases has accumulated. Recently, the relationship between the microbiota and primary Sjögren's disease has been increasingly investigated but has yet to be systematically elucidated. Therefore, a meta-analysis of publications dealing on topic was conducted. Case-control studies comparing primary Sjögren's syndrome patients and healthy controls (HCs) were systematically searched in nine databases from inception to March 1, 2023. The primary result quantitatively evaluated in this meta-analysis was the α-diversity. The secondary results qualitatively extracted and analyzed were the β-diversity and relative abundance. In total, 22 case-control studies covering 915 pSS patients and 2103 HCs were examined. The quantitative analysis revealed a slight reduction in α-diversity in pSS patients compared to HCs, with a lower Shannon-Wiener index (SMD = - 0.46, (- 0.68, - 0.25), p &lt; 0.0001, I2 = 71%), Chao1 richness estimator (SMD = - 0.59, (- 0.86, - 0.32), p &lt; 0.0001, I2 = 81%), and ACE index (SMD = - 0.92, (- 1.64, - 0.19), p = 0.01, I2 = 86%). However, the Simpson index (SMD = 0.01, (- 0.43, 0.46) p = 0.95, I2 = 86%) was similar in the two groups. The β-diversity significantly differed between pSS patients and HCs. Variations in the abundance of specific microbes and their metabolites and potential functions contribute to the pSS pathogenesis. Notably, the abundance of the phylum Firmicutes decreased, while that of Proteobacteria increased. SCFA-producing microbes including Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibacterium, Butyricicoccus, and Eubacterium hallii were depleted. In addition to diversity, the abundances of some specific microbes were related to clinical parameters. According to this systematic review and meta-analysis, gut microbiota dysbiosis, including reduced diversity, was associated with proinflammatory bacterium enrichment and anti-inflammatory bacterium depletion in pSS patients. Further research on the relationship between the gut microbiota and pSS is warranted.

## Metagenomics and metabolomics of Toddy, an Indian fermented date palm beverage.
 10.09.2023, _S Das, JP Tamang_


Toddy is a popular fermented palm beverage of India. No scientific information on shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics are available on toddy of India till date. Hence, we choose the fermented date palm beverage, locally called khejur toddy, of West Bengal and Jharkhand states of India, to profile microbial community, their targeted and untargeted metabolites to study the putative bio-functional genes corresponding to regulatory metabolic pathways. Shotgun-based metataxonomic analyses revealed the existence of all domains where bacteria were the most abundant domain (94.48%) followed by eukaryotes (3.38%), viruses (1.53%) and archaea (0.61%). Overall, 54 phyla, 363 families, 1087 genera and 1885 species were observed and identified. Bacillota (49.3%) was the most abundant bacterial phylum. At species level, several species of bacteria and yeasts were detected in toddy samples which included Leuconostoc mesenteroides,Leuconostoc citreum,Lactobacillus helveticus,Lactiplantibacillus plantarum,Lactococcus lactis, Acetobacter malorum, Gluconobacter japonicus, Gluconacetobacter liquefaciens, Fructobacillus durionis, Zymomonas mobilis and yeastsSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora uvarumandHanseniaspora guilliermondii. Toddy metagenome was also compared with metagenome of pulque, the Mexican fermented fresh sap ofAgave, which was retrieved from NCBI database, and also with metagenomic data of some amplicon-based previous studies on toddy and African fermented palm drink for similarity, dissimilarity and uniqueness among them. Predictive biosynthesis of ethanol, acetic acid, butanoate, linalool, staurosporine, prodigiosin, folic acid, riboflavin, etc. were annotated by KEGG/COG database. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) analysis detected 23 arrays (average length 23.69 bp ± 4.28). Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD) analysis did not show the presence of any momentous antibiotic resistance gene among the major microbial members. Metabolomics analysis detected many primary and secondary metabolites. We believe this is the first report on complete shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics of fermented palm drink of India as well as Eastern India.

_Animals, Mice, COVID-19, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, SARS-CoV-2, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Disease Progression_
Long-term sequelae of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 are frequent and of major concern. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection affects the host gut microbiota, which is linked to disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Here, we report that the gut microbiota of post-COVID subjects had a remarkable predominance of Enterobacteriaceae strains with an antibiotic-resistant phenotype compared to healthy controls. Additionally, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels were reduced in feces. Fecal transplantation from post-COVID subjects to germ-free mice led to lung inflammation and worse outcomes during pulmonary infection by multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. transplanted mice also exhibited poor cognitive performance. Overall, we show prolonged impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gut microbiota that persist after subjects have cleared the virus. Together, these data demonstrate that the gut microbiota can directly contribute to post-COVID sequelae, suggesting that it may be a potential therapeutic target.

## Clustering microbiome data using mixtures of logistic normal multinomial models.
 10.09.2023, _Y Fang, S Subedi_


Discrete data such as counts of microbiome taxa resulting from next-generation sequencing are routinely encountered in bioinformatics. Taxa count data in microbiome studies are typically high-dimensional, over-dispersed, and can only reveal relative abundance therefore being treated as compositional. Analyzing compositional data presents many challenges because they are restricted to a simplex. In a logistic normal multinomial model, the relative abundance is mapped from a simplex to a latent variable that exists on the real Euclidean space using the additive log-ratio transformation. While a logistic normal multinomial approach brings flexibility for modeling the data, it comes with a heavy computational cost as the parameter estimation typically relies on Bayesian techniques. In this paper, we develop a novel mixture of logistic normal multinomial models for clustering microbiome data. Additionally, we utilize an efficient framework for parameter estimation using variational Gaussian approximations (VGA). Adopting a variational Gaussian approximation for the posterior of the latent variable reduces the computational overhead substantially. The proposed method is illustrated on simulated and real datasets.

## A new spike-in-based method for quantitative metabarcoding of soil fungi and bacteria.
 06.09.2023, _M Camacho-Sanchez_


Metabarcoding is a powerful tool to characterize biodiversity in biological samples. The interpretation of taxonomic profiles from metabarcoding data has been hindered by their compositional nature. Several strategies have been proposed to transform compositional data into quantitative data, but they have intrinsic limitations. Here, I propose a workflow based on bacterial and fungal cellular internal standards (spike-ins) for absolute quantification of the microbiota in soil samples. These standards were added to the samples before DNA extraction in amounts estimated after qPCRs, to target around 1-2% coverage in the sequencing run. In bacteria, proportions of spike-in reads in the sequencing run were very similar (&lt; 2-fold change) to those predicted by the qPCR assessment, and for fungi they differed up to 40-fold. The low variation among replicates highlights the reproducibility of the method. Estimates based on multiple bacterial spike-ins were highly correlated (r = 0.99). Procrustes analysis evidenced significant biological effects on the community composition when normalizing compositional data. A protocol based on qPCR estimation of input amounts of cellular spikes is proposed as a cheap and reliable strategy for quantitative metabarcoding of biological samples.
