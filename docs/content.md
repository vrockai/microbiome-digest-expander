## Covid-19: A Perspective on Africa's Capacity and Response.
 11.06.2020, _T Dzinamarira, M Dzobo, I Chitungo_


Global powerhouses with tried and tested health systems have struggled to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. One is left to wonder what will be left of Africa, the second most populous continent after Asia, which is torn by civil wars, hunger, and diseases like AIDS and TB and, in recent years, the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The majority of countries' health systems, already dependent on donor aid, are ill-equipped and under-resourced to deal with the raging pandemic. There is a lack of isolation and intensive care infrastructure, ventilators, and financial resources to bankroll the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is some cause for optimism, for example, in West Africa where infrastructure like diagnostic testing facilities, intensive care units, surveillance, and systems for reporting emergencies used during the EVD outbreak of 2013-2016 can be leveraged to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, a number of African countries have responded swiftly by activating the necessary political and financial tools to combat the pandemic. Technical support from continental bodies like the Africa Centres for Disease Control and global development partners has improved the capacity of the continent to handle the pandemic. In this article, the authors unpack, review, and share a perspective on Africa's capacity to contain and control the COVID-19 pandemic and review the current response.

## Evaluation of the potential incidence of COVID-19 and effectiveness of containment measures in Spain: a data-driven approach.
 29.05.2020, _A Aleta, Y Moreno_


We are currently experiencing an unprecedented challenge, managing and containing an outbreak of a new coronavirus disease known as COVID-19. While China-where the outbreak started-seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays present in multiple countries. Nonetheless, authorities have taken action and implemented containment measures, even if not everything is known.

## Polysaccharides isolated from Cordyceps Sinensis contribute to the progression of NASH by modifying the gut microbiota in mice fed a high-fat diet.
 08.06.2020, _L Chen, L Zhang, W Wang, W Qiu, L Liu, A Ning, J Cao, M Huang, M Zhong_


Various dietary fibers are considered to prevent obesity by modulating the gut microbiota. Cordyceps sinensis polysaccharide (CSP) is a soluble dietary fiber known to have protective effects against obesity and related diseases, but whether these effects induce any side effects remains unknown. The function and safety of CSP were tested in high-fat diet (HFD)-feding C57BL/6J mice. The results revealed that even though CSP supplementation could prevent an increase in body weight, it aggravated liver fibrosis and steatosis as evidenced by increased inflammation, lipid metabolism markers, insulin resistance (IR) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in HFD-induced obesity. 16S rDNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota composition, and the relative abundance of the Actinobacteria phylum, including the Olsenella genus, was significantly higher in CSP-treated mice than in HFD-fed mice. CSP supplementation may increase the proportion of Actinobacteria, which can degrade CSP. The high level of Actinobacteria aggravated the disorder of the intestinal flora and contributed to the progression from obesity to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and related diseases.

## Effect of dietary gossypol supplement on fermentation characteristics and bacterial diversity in the rumen of sheep.
 10.06.2020, _C Wang, Y Li, T MaiTiSaiYiDi, H Yang, K Yang_


The tolerance of ruminants to gossypol, a natural phenolic compound derived from the cotton plant, is greater than that of monogastric animals, partially because of the gossypol-degrading bacteria in the rumen of the ruminants. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of gossypol supplementation on fermentation characteristics, bacterial Î±-diversity and community structure in the rumen fluid of sheep to analyse the change of bacterial in response to gossypol. 8 sheep with permanent fistula were randomly divided into 2 groups, a control and gossypol acetate supplementation groups. Sheep in the latter group were supplemented with gossypol acetate at the levels of 600 mg and 1,200 mg/animal per day during the first (S1, days 1 to 27) and subsequent (S2, days 28 to 47) stages. Gossypol supplementation significantly increased the molar proportion of acetate, and decreased the molar proportion of isobutyric acid, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid in the rumen fluid. Gossypol supplementation have no significant effect on bacterial diversity in the rumen fluid. At the phylum level, gossypol had no effect on bacterial community. At the genus level, gossypol supplementation significantly increased the relative abundance of Treponema_2. However, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of dominant bacterial genera. In conclusion, gossypol supplementation had an effect on molar proportion of acetate, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid, but had no significant effect on the bacterial diversity and relative abundance of dominant bacteria in rumen fluid of sheep.

## Î²-glucan administration improves growth performance and gut health in New Zealand White and APRI rabbits with different breed responses.
 10.06.2020, _MM Abo Ghanima, AH Abd El-Aziz, AE Noreldin, MS Atta, SA Mousa, AH El-Far_


This study investigated the effects of oral administration of Î²-glucan 1,3 (pharmaceutical grade 10%) on growth performance and carcass traits in two breeds of weanling rabbits adapted to survive in Egypt, New Zealand White (NZW) and Animal Production Research Institute (APRI) rabbits, with special attention to relative mRNA expression of interleukins and antioxidant enzyme genes, biochemical, and histological alterations. Oral administration of Î²-glucan with doses 0.25 and 0.5 ml per one-liter of drinking water significantly accelerated body weight gain (BWG) in both rabbits' breeds, reduced total feed consumption (FC), and reduced feed conversion ratio (FCR), especially the 0.5 ml per one-liter dose in both rabbit breeds. There are remarkable differences in all the growth performance traits due to breed effect. The interaction effect between Î²-glucan and breed significantly improved BWG, FC, and FCR. There were non-significant differences in all carcass traits studied due to oral administration of Î²-glucan with both doses, except in dressing percentages. The highest of the dressing percentages were observed at doses 0.25 ml per one-liter (51%) and 0.5 ml per one-liter (52%) compared with control (50%). Our findings show significant variations in the final BW, total daily gain, feed consumption, and total feed conversion ratio between NZW and APRI rabbits. Absence of significant differences in the hot carcass weight and dressing percentage between the genetic groups had been reported in this study. Supplementing NZW and APRI rabbits with Î²-glucan increased blood total protein and globulin. The duodenal villi dimensions, splenic lymphoid diameter, muscular fiber diameter, and muscular glycogen areas were significantly increased by Î²-glucan administration. Expression of intestinal interleukin-18 (IL-18) in NZW rabbits treated with 0.25 and 0.5 doses of Î²-glucan was significantly upregulated and enhanced the immune response. Î²-glucan upregulated the expression of intestinal occludin mRNA particularly at dose 0.5 Î²-glucan as well as upregulated intestinal superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), which modulates anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In conclusion, oral administration of Î²-glucan at a dose of 0.25 or 0.5 ml per one-liter drinking water provided beneficial effects in the growth performance and health status of rabbits.
