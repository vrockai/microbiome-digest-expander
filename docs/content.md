_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Paradoxical boosting of weak and strong spatial memories by hippocampal dopamine uncaging.
 16.05.2024, _C Velazquez-Delgado, J Perez-Becerra, V Calderon, E Hernandez-Ortiz, F Bermudez-Rattoni, L Carrillo-Reid_


The ability to remember changes in the surroundings is fundamental for daily life. It has been proposed that novel events producing dopamine release in the hippocampal CA1 region could modulate spatial memory formation. However, the role of hippocampal dopamine increase on weak or strong spatial memories remains unclear. We show that male mice exploring two objects located in a familiar environment for 5 minutes created a short-term memory (weak) that cannot be retrieved one day later, whereas 10 minutes exploration created a long-term memory (strong) that can be retrieved one day later. Remarkably, hippocampal dopamine elevation during the encoding of weak object location memories (OLMs) allowed their retrieval one day later but dopamine elevation during the encoding of strong OLMs promoted the preference for a familiar object location over a novel object location after 24 hours. Moreover, dopamine uncaging after the encoding of OLMs did not have effect on weak memories whereas on strong memories diminished the exploration of the novel object location. Additionally, hippocampal dopamine elevation during the retrieval of OLMs did not allow the recovery of weak memories and did not affect the retrieval of strong memory traces. Finally, dopamine elevation increased hippocampal theta oscillations, indicating that dopamine promotes the recurrent activation of specific groups of neurons. Our experiments demonstrate that hippocampal dopaminergic modulation during the encoding of OLMs depends on memory strength indicating that hyperdopaminergic levels that enhance weak experiences could compromise the normal storage of strong memories.Significance statement Increased levels of dopamine have been related to cognitive enhancement. Hippocampal dopamine elevation caused by novelty exposure has been proposed as a strategy to enhance memory based on the observation that surprising events create flashbulb memories that are remembered for long time. However, hyperdopaminergic levels could also underlie maladaptive memories, such as non-desired preservation of traumatic experiences. Our experiments show that dopamine elevation in the dorsal hippocampus during the encoding of spatial memories has paradoxical effects, while the enhancement of weak memories allows their retrieval, the dopaminergic modulation of strong memories limits the ability to modify preexisting spatial memories by changes in the environment. We conclude that cognitive enhancement through dopamine boosting must consider diverse aspects of memory formation.

The oral microenvironment contributes to microbial composition and immune equilibrium. It is considered to be influenced by dietary habits. Phenylketonuria (PKU) patients, who follow a lifelong low-protein diet, exhibit higher prevalence of oral diseases such as periodontitis, offering a suitable model to explore the interplay between diet, oral microbiota and oral health.

## Microbroth dilution method for antibiotic susceptibility testing of fastidious and anaerobic bacteria of the urinary microbiome.
 06.05.2024, _W Geaman, BI Choi, J Kaindl, C Gonzalez, AJ Wolfe_


Bacterial isolates from the human urinary microbiome have been extensively studied for their antibiotic resistance; however, little work has been done on those isolates that are difficult to grow in vitro. This study was designed to qualify a serum-based medium, New York City Broth III (NYCIII), in both sections =and a broth microdilution method to determine the antibiotic susceptibility of previously underreported or undescribed microbes that have a difficult time growing in standard Mueller-Hinton broth. Here, we demonstrate that NYCIII microbroth dilution can be an effective method for the determination of antibiotic susceptibility of species found in the human urinary microbiome. We show that this method serves well to characterize fastidious and anaerobic urinary microbes that have no Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines, including several in the families Aerococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, or Actinomycetaceae. Previous studies using expanded quantitative urine culture reveal that urine samples from clinical patients are commonly polymicrobial in composition. Thus, we test whether NYCIII can serve as a viable harmonized medium, capable of supporting antibiotic susceptibility testing in a range of fastidious, non-fastidious, and anaerobic urinary microbes. We propose this methodology to be standardized comparable to CLSI standards to allow for resistance testing in uncharacterized urinary bacteria.

The human upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome, like the gut microbiome, varies across individuals and between health and disease states. However, study-to-study heterogeneity in reported case-control results has made the identification of consistent and generalizable URT-disease associations difficult.

## Microbial community structure of plant-based meat alternatives.
 16.05.2024, _FF Roch, M Dzieciol, NM Quijada, LV Alteio, PJ Mester, E Selberherr_


A reduction in animal-based diets has driven market demand for alternative meat products, currently raising a new generation of plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs). It remains unclear whether these substitutes are a short-lived trend or become established in the long term. Over the last few years, the trend of increasing sales and diversifying product range has continued, but publication activities in this field are currently limited mainly to market research and food technology topics. As their popularity increases, questions emerge about the safety and nutritional risks of these novel products. Even though all the examined products must be heated before consumption, consumers lack experience with this type of product and thus further research into product safety, is desirable. To consider these issues, we examined 32 PBMAs from Austrian supermarkets. Based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the majority of the products were dominated by lactic acid bacteria (either Leuconostoc or Latilactobacillus), and generally had low alpha diversity. Pseudomonadota (like Pseudomonas and Shewanella) dominated the other part of the products. In addition to LABs, a high diversity of different Bacillus, but also some Enterobacteriaceae and potentially pathogenic species were isolated with the culturing approach. We assume that especially the dominance of heterofermentative LABs has high relevance for the product stability and quality with the potential to increase shelf life of the products. The number of isolated Enterobacteriaceae and potential pathogens were low, but they still demonstrated that these products are suitable for their presence.

Steroid receptors regulate gene expression for many important physiologic functions and pathologic processes. Receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and androgen have been extensively studied in breast cancer, and their expression provides prognostic information as well as targets for therapy. Noninvasive imaging utilizing positron emission tomography and radiolabeled ligands targeting these receptors can provide valuable insight into predicting treatment efficacy, staging whole-body disease burden, and identifying heterogeneity in receptor expression across different metastatic sites. This review provides an overview of steroid receptor imaging with a focus on breast cancer and radioligands for estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors.

## MR Imaging Features of Critical Spinal Demyelinating Lesions Associated with Progressive Motor Impairment.

Progressive MS is typically heralded by a myelopathic pattern of asymmetric progressive motor weakness. Focal individual "critical" demyelinating spinal cord lesions anatomically associated with progressive motor impairment may be a compelling explanation for this clinical presentation as described in progressive solitary sclerosis (single CNS demyelinating lesion), progressive demyelination with highly restricted MR imaging lesion burden (2-5 total CNS demyelinating lesions; progressive paucisclerotic MS), and progressive, exclusively unilateral hemi- or monoparetic MS (&gt;5 CNS demyelinating progressive unilateral hemi- or monoparetic MS [PUHMS] lesions). Critical demyelinating lesions appear strikingly similar across these cohorts, and we describe their specific spinal cord MR imaging characteristics.

## Early-life factors shaping the gut microbiota of Common buzzard nestlings.
 16.05.2024, _H Pereira, N Chakarov, JI Hoffman, T Rinaud, M Ottensmann, KP Gladow, B Tobias, BA Caspers, Ö Maraci, O Krüger_


Exploring the dynamics of gut microbiome colonisation during early-life stages is important for understanding the potential impact of microbes on host development and fitness. Evidence from model organisms suggests a crucial early-life phase when shifts in gut microbiota can lead to immune dysregulation and reduced host condition. However, our understanding of gut microbiota colonisation in long-lived vertebrates, especially during early development, remains limited. We therefore used a wild population of common buzzard nestlings (Buteo buteo) to investigate connections between the early-life gut microbiota colonisation, environmental and host factors.

We present metagenomes of 16 samples of water and sediment from two lakes, collected from eutrophic and non-eutrophic areas, including pooled samples enriched with phosphate and nitrate. Additionally, we assembled 167 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). These MAGs were de-replicated into 83 unique genomes representing different species found in the lakes. All the MAGs exhibited &gt;70% completeness and &lt;10% contamination, with 79 MAGs being classified as 'nearly complete' (completeness &gt;90%), while 54 falling within 80-90% range and 34 between 75-80% complete. The most abundant MAGs identified across all samples were Proteobacteria (n = 80), Firmicutes_A (n = 35), Firmicutes (n = 13), and Bacteriodota (n = 22). Other groups included Desulfobacteria_I (n = 2), Verrucomicrobiota (n = 4), Campylobacterota (n = 4) and Actinobacteriota (n = 6). Importantly, phylogenomic analysis identified that approximately 50.3% of the MAGs could not be classified to known species, suggesting the presence of potentially new and unknown bacteria in these lakes, warranting further in-depth investigation. This study provides valuable new dataset on the diverse and often unique microbial communities living in polluted lakes, useful in developing effective strategies to manage pollution.

## A Novel Inhibitor of Translation Initiation Factor eIF5B in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
 16.05.2024, _AR Goh, YN Kim, JH Oh, SK Choi_


The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF5B is a bacterial IF2 ortholog that plays an important role in ribosome joining and stabilization of the initiator tRNA on the AUG start codon during the initiation of translation. We identified the fluorophenyl oxazole derivative 2,2-dibromo-1-(2-(4-fluorophenyl)benzo[d]oxazol-5-yl)ethanone quinolinol as an inhibitor of fungal protein synthesis using an in vitro translation assay in a fungal system. Mutants resistant to this compound were isolated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and were demonstrated to contain amino acid substitutions in eIF5B that conferred the resistance. These results suggest that eIF5B is a target of potential antifungal compound and that mutation of eIF5B can confer resistance. Subsequent identification of 16 other mutants revealed that primary mutations clustered mainly on domain 2 of eIF5B and secondarily mainly on domain 4. Domain 2 has been implicated in the interaction with the small ribosomal subunit during initiation of translation. The tested translation inhibitor could act by weakening the functional contact between eIF5B and the ribosome complex. This data provides the basis for the development of a new family of antifungals.

Emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is an important threat to global health. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are some of the key components to define bacterial resistance and their spread in different environments. Identification of ARGs, particularly from high-throughput sequencing data of the specimens, is the state-of-the-art method for comprehensively monitoring their spread and evolution. Current computational methods to identify ARGs mainly rely on alignment-based sequence similarities with known ARGs. Such approaches are limited by choice of reference databases and may potentially miss novel ARGs. The similarity thresholds are usually simple and could not accommodate variations across different gene families and regions. It is also difficult to scale up when sequence data are increasing.
