Bifidobacteria are among the first colonizers of the infant gut, and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) in breastmilk are instrumental for the formation of a bifidobacteria-rich microbiota. However, little is known about the assembly of bifidobacterial communities. Here, by applying assembly theory to a community of four representative infant-gut associated Bifidobacterium species that employ varied strategies for HMO consumption, we show that arrival order and sugar consumption phenotypes significantly affected community formation. Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, two avid HMO consumers, dominate through inhibitory priority effects. On the other hand, Bifidobacterium breve, a species with limited HMO-utilization ability, can benefit from facilitative priority effects and dominates by utilizing fucose, an HMO degradant not utilized by the other bifidobacterial species. Analysis of publicly available breastfed infant faecal metagenome data showed that the observed trends for B. breve were consistent with our in vitro data, suggesting that priority effects may have contributed to its dominance. Our study highlights the importance and history dependency of initial community assembly and its implications for the maturation trajectory of the infant gut microbiota.

 01.07.2022, _IM Rambo, MV Langwig, P Leão, V De Anda, BJ Baker_


Asgard archaea are globally distributed prokaryotic microorganisms related to eukaryotes; however, viruses that infect these organisms have not been described. Here, using metagenome sequences recovered from deep-sea hydrothermal sediments, we characterize six relatively large (up to 117 kb) double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viral genomes that infected two Asgard archaeal phyla, Lokiarchaeota and Helarchaeota. These viruses encode Caudovirales-like structural proteins, as well as proteins distinct from those described in known archaeal viruses. Their genomes contain around 1-5% of genes associated with eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) and appear to be capable of semi-autonomous genome replication, repair, epigenetic modifications and transcriptional regulation. Moreover, Helarchaeota viruses may hijack host ubiquitin systems similar to eukaryotic viruses. Genomic analysis of these Asgard viruses reveals that they contain features of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, and provides insights into their potential infection and host interaction mechanisms.

Well-balanced interactions between gut microbiota and the immune system are essential to prevent chronic intestinal inflammation, as observed in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) functions as a sensor mediating the crosstalk between the intestinal commensal microbiome and host immunity, but the influence of TLR4 on the shaping of intestinal microbiota and immune responses during colon inflammation remains poorly characterized. We investigated whether the different susceptibilities to colitis between wild-type (WT) and TLR4-/- mice were gut microbiota-dependent and aimed to identify the potential immunity modulation mechanism.

## The triple interactions between gut microbiota, mycobiota and host immunity.
 01.07.2022, _J Yang, H Yang, Y Li_


The gut microbiome is mainly composed of microbiota and mycobiota, both of which play important roles in the development of the host immune system, metabolic regulation, and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. With the increasing awareness of the pathogenic essence of infectious, immunodeficiency, and tumor-related diseases, the interactions between gut bacteria, fungi, and host immunity have been shown to directly influence the disease process or final therapeutic outcome, and collaborative and antagonistic relationships are commonly found between bacteria and fungi. Interventions represented by probiotics, prebiotics, engineered probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and drugs can effectively modulate the triple interactions. In particular, traditional probiotics represented by Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and next-generation probiotics represented by Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii showed a high enrichment trend in the gut of patients with a high response to inflammation remission and tumor immunotherapy, which predicts the potential medicinal value of these beneficial microbial formulations. However, there are bottlenecks in all these interventions that need to be broken. Meanwhile, further unraveling the underlying mechanisms of the "triple interactions" model can guide precise interventions and ultimately improve the efficiency of interventions on the host gut microbiome and immune modulation, thus directly or indirectly improving anti-inflammatory and tumor immunotherapy effects.

## The role of microbiome: a novel insight into urolithiasis.
 01.07.2022, _SY Hong, QD Xia, YY Yang, C Li, JQ Zhang, JZ Xu, BL Qin, Y Xun, SG Wang_


Urolithiasis, referred to as the formation of stones in the urinary tract, is a common disease with growing prevalence and high recurrence rate worldwide. Although researchers have endeavoured to explore the mechanism of urinary stone formation for novel effective therapeutic and preventative measures, the exact aetiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Propelled by sequencing technologies and culturomics, great advances have been made in understanding the pivotal contribution of the human microbiome to urolithiasis. Indeed, there are diverse and abundant microbes interacting with the host in the urinary tract, overturning the dogma that urinary system, and urine are sterile. The urinary microbiome of stone formers was clearly distinct from healthy individuals. Besides, dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiome appears to be involved in stone formation through the gut-kidney axis. Thus, the human microbiome has potential significant implications for the aetiology of urolithiasis, providing a novel insight into diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic strategies. Herein, we review and summarize the landmark microbiome studies in urolithiasis and identify therapeutic implications, challenges, and future perspectives in this rapidly evolving field. To conclude, a new front has opened with the evidence for a microbial role in stone formation, offering potential applications in the prevention, and treatment of urolithiasis.

## Symbiosis: the other cells in development.
 01.07.2022, _TJ Carrier, TCG Bosch_


Animal development is an inherently complex process that is regulated by highly conserved genomic networks, and the resulting phenotype may remain plastic in response to environmental signals. Despite development having been studied in a more natural setting for the past few decades, this framework often precludes the role of microbial prokaryotes in these processes. Here, we address how microbial symbioses impact animal development from the onset of gametogenesis through adulthood. We then provide a first assessment of which developmental processes may or may not be influenced by microbial symbioses and, in doing so, provide a holistic view of the budding discipline of developmental symbiosis.

## Dysbiosis of the Gut Microbiome Is Associated With Histopathology of Lung Cancer.
 01.07.2022, _X Qin, L Bi, W Yang, Y He, Y Gu, Y Yang, Y Gong, Y Wang, X Yan, L Xu, H Xiao, L Jiao_


Lung cancer is a malignancy with high incidence and mortality worldwide. Previous studies have shown that the gut microbiome plays an important role in the development and progression of metabolic cancers. However, data on the characteristics of the gut microbiome with different histopathology types of lung cancer remain scant. We collected stool samples from 28 healthy people (HP) and 61 lung cancer patients. The lung cancer patients were classified into three types according to their histopathology: Atypical Adenomatous Hyperplasia/Adenocarcinoma in situ (AAH/AIS), Minimally Invasive Adenocarcinoma (MIA), and Invasive Adenocarcinoma (IA). In addition, we employed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to analyze the characteristics of the gut microbiome in these patients. Our analysis revealed that the categorized cancer patients had unique intestinal flora characteristics, and had lower density and flora diversity compared to healthy people. Besides, the structure of the flora families and genera was more complex, and each group presented specific pathogenic microbiota. The patients in the AAH/AIS group and HP group had relatively similar flora structure compared with the IA and MIA groups. In addition, we identified several flora markers that showed significant changes with the development of lung cancer. Lung cancer gut microbiota showed a decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing and anti-inflammatory bacteria compared to healthy people, while some pathogenic bacteria such as proinflammatory or tumor-promoting bacteria were more abundant in lung cancer patients. On the other hand, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) annotation demonstrated suppression of some dominant metabolism-related pathways in lung cancer. These findings provide new biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of lung cancer and lay the basis for novel targeted therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of lung cancer.

## Perspective: Leveraging the Gut Microbiota to Predict Personalized Responses to Dietary, Prebiotic, and Probiotic Interventions.
 01.07.2022, _SM Gibbons, T Gurry, JW Lampe, A Chakrabarti, V Dam, A Everard, A Goas, G Gabriele, M Kleerebez, J Lane, J Maukonen, ALB Penna, B Pot, AM Valdes, G Walton, A Weiss, YC Zanzer, NV Venlet, M Miani_


Humans often show variable responses to dietary, prebiotic, and probiotic interventions. Emerging evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is a key determinant for this population heterogeneity. Here, we provide an overview of some of the major computational and experimental tools being applied to critical questions of microbiota-mediated personalized nutrition and health. First, we discuss the latest advances in in silico modeling of the microbiota-nutrition-health axis, including the application of statistical, mechanistic, and hybrid artificial intelligence models. Second, we address high-throughput in vitro techniques for assessing inter-individual heterogeneity, from ex vivo batch culturing of stool and continuous culturing in anaerobic bioreactors, to more sophisticated organ-on-a-chip models that integrate both host and microbial compartments. Third, we explore in vivo approaches for better understanding personalized, microbiota-mediated responses to diet, prebiotics, and probiotics, from non-human animal models and human observational studies, to human feeding trials and crossover interventions. We highlight examples of existing, consumer-facing precision nutrition platforms that are currently leveraging the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we discuss how the integration of a broader set of the tools and techniques described in this piece can generate the data necessary to support a greater diversity of precision nutrition strategies. Finally, we present a vision of a precision nutrition and healthcare future, which leverages the gut microbiota to design effective, individual-specific interventions.

## Akkermansia muciniphila Alters Gut Microbiota and Immune System to Improve Cardiovascular Diseases in Murine Model.
 01.07.2022, _X He, Y Bai, H Zhou, K Wu_


The gut microbiota plays an important role in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The probiotics screened based on microbiota can effectively improve metabolism and immune function of the body, which is of great value in the field of cardiovascular disease treatment. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) refer to the lesion or injury of the abdominal aortic wall resulting in a localized bulge, which is one of the cardiovascular diseases with pulsing mass as the main clinical symptom. Previous studies have confirmed that A. muciniphila was depleted in the guts of AAA patients or mice. A. muciniphila is a potential probiotic for the treatment of intestinal microbiome-related diseases. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of A. muciniphila on gut microbiota and disease-related biomarkers in AAA mice. C57BL/6J mice were used to construct the AAA model and treated with A. muciniphila. Aortic aneurysm formation in the AAA group is associated with the increased diameter of the abdominal aorta and inflammatory infiltration. A. muciniphila inhibited the formation of AAA and repaired tissue damage. The number of gut microbiota and α diversity index were decreased in the model group. A. muciniphila increased the number of gut microbiota and α diversity in AAA mice. The abundance of uncultured bacterium and Lactobacillus were increased, while the abundance of the Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group was reduced in the AAA group. Compared with the control group, the levels of MMP-1, MMP-9, IL-33, CTSB, and CTSL in tissue and the levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, and CRP in blood were significantly increased, and the levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-17A in blood were significantly decreased in the AAA group. The intervention of A. muciniphila reversed these changes. The gut microbiota function prediction showed changes in E. coli, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus metabolism-related functional pathways. Akkermansia was negatively correlated with Helicobacter and Lactobacillus and positively correlated with Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Escherichia shigella at the genus level. In conclusion, A. muciniphila inhibited the formation of AAA by restoring gut microbiota diversity, altering the expression of peripheral immune factors, and the functions of E. coli, Clostridium, and Lactobacillus, which may provide a new theoretical basis for the application of probiotics in cardiovascular diseases.
