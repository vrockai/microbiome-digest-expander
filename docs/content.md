## The effect of probiotic supplementation on the gut microbiota of preterm infants.
 26.08.2021, _EL Plummer, JA Danielewski, SM Garland, J Su, SE Jacobs, GL Murray_


Introduction. Probiotic supplementation of preterm infants may prevent serious morbidities associated with prematurity.Aim. To investigate the impact of probiotic supplementation on the gut microbiota and determine factors associated with detection of probiotic species in the infant gut.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Probiotic supplementation increases the long-term colonization of probiotic species in the gut of preterm infants.Methodology. Longitudinal stool samples were collected from a cohort of very preterm infants participating in a blinded randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of probiotic supplementation (containing Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis BB-02, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4) for prevention of late-onset sepsis. The presence of B. longum subsp. infantis, B. animalis subsp. lactis and S. thermophilus was determined for up to 23 months after supplementation ended using real-time PCR. Logistic regression was used to investigate the impact of probiotic supplementation on the presence of each species.Results. Detection of B. longum subsp. infantis [odds ratio (OR): 53.1; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 35.6-79.1; P &lt; 0.001], B. animalis subsp. lactis (OR: 89.1; 95 % CI: 59.0-134.5; P &lt; 0.001) and S. thermophilus (OR: 5.66; 95 % CI: 4.35-7.37; P &lt; 0.001) was increased during the supplementation period in infants receiving probiotic supplementation. Post-supplementation, probiotic-supplemented infants had increased detection of B. longum subsp. infantis (OR: 2.53; 95 % CI: 1.64-3.90; P &lt; 0.001) and B. animalis subsp. lactis (OR: 1.59; 95 % CI: 1.05-2.41; P=0.030). Commencing probiotic supplementation before 5 days from birth was associated with increased detection of the probiotic species over the study period (B. longum subsp. infantis, OR: 1.20; B. animalis subsp. lactis, OR: 1.28; S. thermophilus, OR: 1.45).Conclusion. Probiotic supplementation with B. longum subsp. infantis BB-02, B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and S. thermophilus TH-4 enhances the presence of probiotic species in the gut microbiota of very preterm infants during and after supplementation. Commencing probiotic supplementation shortly after birth may be important for improving the long-term colonization of probiotic species.

## Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) Fruit Polysaccharides Regulated IBD Mice Via Targeting Gut Microbiota: Association of JNK/ERK/NF-κB Signaling Pathways.
 25.08.2021, _MY Jin, XY Wu, MY Li, XT Li, RM Huang, YM Sun, ZL Xu_


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease characterized by intestinal inflammation with immune dysregulation and intestinal microecological imbalance. In a dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced IBD mouse model, noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) fruit polysaccharides (NFP) with homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I domain decreased the concentration of serum LPS, TNF-α, and IL-17 by 84, 42, and 65%, respectively. It was abolished when intestinal microbiota were depleted by antibiotics. Sequencing analysis of gut microbiota showed an attenuated disruption of the microbial composition in the DSS+NFP group. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed that NFP upregulated the content of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid by onefold but reduced isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid contents. NFP also inhibited JNK, ERK, and NF-κB phosphorylation of IBD mice. Taken together, the mechanism of NFP alleviating IBD is related to the intestinal microecological balance to inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways. This study provides a basis for NFP as a cheap intervention for the prevention and treatment of IBD patients.

## Long-term personalized low FODMAP diet improves symptoms and maintains luminal Bifidobacteria abundance in irritable bowel syndrome.

Short-term trials demonstrate the low FODMAP diet improves symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but impacts nutrient intake and the gastrointestinal microbiota. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical symptoms, nutrient intake, and microbiota of patients with IBS 12 months after starting a low FODMAP diet.

## Redundant cytokine requirement for intestinal microbiota-induced Th17 cell differentiation in draining lymph nodes.
 25.08.2021, _T Sano, T Kageyama, V Fang, R Kedmi, CS Martinez, J Talbot, A Chen, I Cabrera, O Gorshko, R Kurakake, Y Yang, C Ng, SR Schwab, DR Littman_


Differentiation of intestinal T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which contribute to mucosal barrier protection from invasive pathogens, is dependent on colonization with distinct commensal bacteria. Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are sufficient to support Th17 cell differentiation in mouse, but the molecular and cellular requirements for this process remain incompletely characterized. Here, we show that intestine-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), not intestine proper, are the dominant site of SFB-induced intestinal Th17 cell differentiation. Subsequent migration of these cells to the intestinal lamina propria is dependent on their upregulation of integrin β7. Stat3-dependent induction of RORγt, the Th17 cell-specifying transcription factor, largely depends on IL-6, but signaling through the receptors for IL-21 and IL-23 can compensate for absence of IL-6 to promote SFB-directed Th17 cell differentiation. These results indicate that redundant cytokine signals guide commensal microbe-dependent Th17 cell differentiation in the MLNs and accumulation of the cells in the lamina propria.

## Honeybee intestines retain low yeast titers, but no bacterial mutualists, at emergence.
 26.08.2021, _JP Tauber, D McMahon, EV Ryabov, M Kunat, A Ptaszynska, JD Evans_


Honeybee symbionts, predominantly bacteria, play important roles in honeybee health, nutrition and pathogen protection, thereby supporting colony health. On the other hand, fungi are often considered indicators of poor bee health and honeybee microbiome studies generally exclude fungi and yeasts. We hypothesized that yeasts may be an important aspect of early honeybee biology and if yeasts provide a mutual benefit to their hosts, then honeybees could provide a refuge during metamorphosis to ensure the presence of yeasts at emergence. We surveyed for yeast and fungi during pupal development and metamorphosis in worker bees using fungal-specific qPCR, next-generation sequencing and standard microbiological culturing. Based on yeast presence in three distinct apiaries and multiple developmental stages, we conclude that yeasts can survive through metamorphosis and in naïve worker bees, albeit at relatively low levels. In comparison, known bacterial mutualists, like Gilliamella and Snodgrassella, were generally not found in pre-eclosed adult bees. Whether yeasts are actively retained as an important part of the bee microbiota or are passively propagating in the colony remains unknown. Our demonstration of the constancy of yeasts throughout development provides a framework to further understand the honeybee microbiota.

## The oral microbiota of wild bears in Sweden reflects the history of antibiotic use by humans.
 26.08.2021, _JC Brealey, HG Leitão, T Hofstede, DC Kalthoff, K Guschanski_


Following the advent of industrial-scale antibiotic production in the 1940s,1 antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been on the rise and now poses a major global health threat in terms of mortality, morbidity, and economic burden.2,3 Because AMR can be exchanged between humans, livestock, and wildlife, wild animals can be used as indicators of human-associated AMR contamination of the environment.4 However, AMR is a normal function of natural environments and is present in host-associated microbiomes, which makes it challenging to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural sources.4,5 One way to overcome this difficulty is to use historical samples that span the period from before the mass production of antibiotics to today. We used shotgun metagenomic sequencing of dental calculus, the calcified form of the oral microbial biofilm, to determine the abundance and repertoire of AMR genes in the oral microbiome of Swedish brown bears collected over the last 180 years. Our temporal metagenomics approach allowed us to establish a baseline of natural AMR in the pre-antibiotics era and to quantify a significant increase in total AMR load and diversity of AMR genes that is consistent with patterns of national human antibiotic use. We also demonstrated a significant decrease in total AMR load in bears in the last two decades, which coincides with Swedish strategies to mitigate AMR. Our study suggests that public health policies can be effective in limiting human-associated AMR contamination of the environment and wildlife.
