The prevalence of brain disorders, including stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders and conditions with cognitive dysfunction, is rising. Poor dietary habits contribute substantially to this accelerating trend. Conversely, healthy dietary intake supports mood and cognitive performance. Recently, the communication between the microorganisms within the gastrointestinal tract and the brain along the gut-brain axis has gained prominence as a potential tractable target to modulate brain health. The composition and function of the gut microbiota is robustly influenced by dietary factors to alter gut-brain signalling. To reflect this interconnection between diet, gut microbiota and brain functioning, we propose that a diet-microbiota-gut-brain axis exists that underpins health and well-being. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the interplay between diet and gut microbiota composition and function and the implications for cognition and emotional functioning. Important diet-induced effects on the gut microbiota for the development, prevention and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders are described. The diet-microbiota-gut-brain axis represents an uncharted frontier for brain health diagnostics and therapeutics across the lifespan.

The human gut pathogen Clostridioides difficile displays substantial inter-strain genetic variability and confronts a changeable nutrient landscape in the gut. We examined how human gut microbiota inter-species interactions influence the growth and toxin production of various C. difficile strains across different nutrient environments. Negative interactions influencing C. difficile growth are prevalent in an environment containing a single highly accessible resource and sparse in an environment containing C. difficile-preferred carbohydrates. C. difficile toxin production displays significant community-context dependent variation and does not trend with growth-mediated inter-species interactions. C. difficile strains exhibit differences in interactions with Clostridium scindens and the ability to compete for proline. Further, C. difficile shows substantial differences in transcriptional profiles in co-culture with C. scindens or Clostridium hiranonis. C. difficile exhibits massive alterations in metabolism and other cellular processes in co-culture with C. hiranonis, reflecting their similar metabolic niches. C. hiranonis uniquely inhibits the growth and toxin production of diverse C. difficile strains across different nutrient environments and robustly ameliorates disease severity in mice. In sum, understanding the impact of C. difficile strain variability and nutrient environments on inter-species interactions could help improve the effectiveness of anti-C. difficile strategies.

Imbalanced microbiota may contribute to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), thus fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been suggested as a potential treatment. Previous studies on the relationship between clinical improvement and microbiota after FMT have been inconclusive. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomics data from a randomized, placebo controlled FMT trial on 49 IBS patients to analyze changes after FMT in microbiota composition and its functional potential, and to identify connections between microbiota and patients' clinical outcome. As a result, we found that the successful modulation of microbiota composition and functional profiles by FMT from a healthy donor was not associated with the resolution of symptoms in IBS patients. Notably, a donor derived strain of Prevotella copri dominated the microbiota in those patients in the FMT group who had a low relative abundance of P. copri pre-FMT. The results highlight the multifactorial nature of IBS and the role of recipient's microbiota in the colonization of donor's strains.

Obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) have become public health concerns worldwide. Both conditions have severe consequences and are associated with significant medical costs and productivity loss. Additionally, Helicobacter pylori infection may be a risk factor for the development of these conditions. However, whether eradicating H. pylori infection directly causes weight loss or improves insulin sensitivity is unknown.

## Mining human microbiomes reveals an untapped source of peptide antibiotics.
 27.08.2024, _MDT Torres, EF Brooks, A Cesaro, H Sberro, MO Gill, C Nicolaou, AS Bhatt, C de la Fuente-Nunez_


Drug-resistant bacteria are outpacing traditional antibiotic discovery efforts. Here, we computationally screened 444,054 previously reported putative small protein families from 1,773 human metagenomes for antimicrobial properties, identifying 323 candidates encoded in small open reading frames (smORFs). To test our computational predictions, 78 peptides were synthesized and screened for antimicrobial activity in vitro, with 70.5% displaying antimicrobial activity. As these compounds were different compared with previously reported antimicrobial peptides, we termed them smORF-encoded peptides (SEPs). SEPs killed bacteria by targeting their membrane, synergizing with each other, and modulating gut commensals, indicating a potential role in reconfiguring microbiome communities in addition to counteracting pathogens. The lead candidates were anti-infective in both murine skin abscess and deep thigh infection models. Notably, prevotellin-2 from Prevotella copri presented activity comparable to the commonly used antibiotic polymyxin B. Our report supports the existence of hundreds of antimicrobials in the human microbiome amenable to clinical translation.

Enteric pathogens navigate distinct regional microenvironments within the intestine that cue important adaptive behaviors. We investigated the response of Citrobacter rodentium, a model of human pathogenic Escherichia coli infection in mice, to regional gastrointestinal pH. We found that small intestinal pH (4.4-4.8) triggered virulence gene expression and altered cell morphology, supporting initial intestinal attachment, while higher pH, representative of C. rodentium's replicative niches further along the murine intestine, supported pathogen growth. Gastric pH, a key barrier to intestinal colonization, caused significant accumulation of intra-bacterial reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting growth of C. rodentium and related human pathogens. Within-host adaptation increased gastric acid survival, which may be due to a robust acid tolerance response (ATR) induced at colonic pH. However, the intestinal environment changes throughout the course of infection. We found that murine gastric pH decreases postinfection, corresponding to increased serum gastrin levels and altered host expression of acid secretion-related genes. Similar responses following Salmonella infection may indicate a protective host response to limit further pathogen ingestion. Together, we highlight interlinked bacterial and host adaptive pH responses as an important component of host-pathogen coevolution.

## An Examination of Exercise Intensity and its Impact on the Acute Release of Irisin Across Obesity Status: A Randomized Controlled Crossover Trial.
 03.09.2024, _BV Rioux, Y Paudel, AM Thomson, LE Peskett, M Sénéchal_


Limited data exist regarding the impact of exercise intensity on irisin release and its association with insulin sensitivity in individuals of differing obesity status. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of exercise intensity on the acute release of irisin in healthy weight individuals and individuals with obesity, and whether irisin release during acute exercise was associated with greater insulin sensitivity across obesity status. A randomized controlled crossover study was conducted on 26 non-obese (NOB) (BMI: 22.2±1.5 kg/m2) and 26 OB (BMI: 33.9±6.5 kg/m2) adults who performed an acute bout of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and rest. Irisin was quantified via ELISA and western blotting, and insulin sensitivity (Si) was estimated using the Matsuda index. OB displayed a significantly lower level of circulating irisin and protein expression compared to NOB (p&lt;0.01). Insulin sensitivity was positively correlated with irisin release during MICT and HIIT in NOB (all p&lt;0.05), but not in OB. Regarding irisin expression, NOB with high-Si had a 2.03-fold (p&lt;0.05) increase during HIIT, while OB with high-Si had only a 1.54-fold increase (p&lt;0.05). These results suggest that irisin is released differently according to obesity status and varying exercise intensities. OB individuals have a blunted irisin response to acute exercise and lower baseline irisin concentrations compared to NOB individuals. Although exercise stimulates irisin release in NOB individuals, only a greater exercise intensity stimulates irisin release in OB individuals. These findings are clinically relevant, as irisin is associated with greater insulin sensitivity.

The maternal pregnancy microbiome (including genitourinary and gut) has been linked to important pregnancy/birth and later childhood health outcomes. However, such sampling as part of large population cohort studies is logistically and financially challenging. Many countries routinely collect vaginal or vaginal-rectal swabs in late pregnancy for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) screening, but their utility for population-based research is still unclear. As part of planning for the Generation Victoria population-based cohort study beginning in pregnancy, we assessed the utility and reliability of residual clinical GBS vaginal/vaginal-rectal swabs for generating late pregnancy microbiome data. We carried out a two-phased pilot study. Phase one assessed the level of microbial diversity apparent in 'residual' clinical vaginal/vaginal-rectal swabs post clinical testing and storage for 7-10 days at 4 °C (routine clinical practice). Phase two directly assessed the impact of storage time and temperature on the microbial composition of vaginal/vaginal-rectal swabs collected specifically for research purposes. The microbiota composition in the 'residual' clinical swabs aligned with published studies. The 'research' swabs, stored at 4 °C for up to ten days, showed minimal changes in microbiota profile, compared to swabs examined on the day of collection. In contrast, significant variation in diversity was seen in swabs stored at room temperature for up to 48 h. Residual clinical material from swabs collected primarily for GBS screening in late pregnancy represent a reliable and abundant source of material for assessing the late pregnancy maternal microbiome for research purposes. This represents a low-burden opportunity for population-representative pregnancy studies to assess the potential of late pregnancy microbiome for prediction and understanding maternal and child health outcomes.

## Sex-dependent effects of a high fat diet on metabolic disorders, intestinal barrier function and gut microbiota in mouse.

Obesity is often associated with sex-dependent metabolic complications, in which altered intestinal barrier function and gut microbiota contribute. We aimed to characterize in mice the sex-dependent effects of a high fat diet on these parameters. Male and female C57BL/6 mice received a standard (SD) or high fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) during 14 weeks (W14). Body composition, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, intestinal permeability, colonic expression of 44 genes encoding factors involved in inflammatory response and gut barrier function, cecal microbiota, plasma adipokines and white adipose tissue response have been assessed. Both male and female HFD mice exhibited an increase of body weight and fat mass gain and glucose intolerance compared to SD mice. However, only male HFD mice tended to develop insulin resistance associated to increased Tnfα and Ccl2 mRNA expression in perigonadal adipose tissue. By contrast, only female HFD mice showed significant intestinal hyperpermeability that was associated with more markedly altered colonic inflammatory response. Cecal microbiota richness was markedly reduced in both sexes (Observed species) with sex-dependent modifications at the phyla or family level, e.g. decreased relative abundance of Bacillota and Lachnospiraceae in females, increased of Bacteroidaceae in males. Interestingly, some of these microbiota alterations were correlated with peripheral metabolic and inflammatory markers. In conclusions, male and female mice exhibit different responses to a high fat diet with specific changes of gut microbiota, intestinal barrier function, colonic and white adipose tissue inflammation, metabolic markers and body weight gain. The underlying mechanisms should be deciphered in further investigations.

Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites that act as vectors for transmission of various pathogens. The purpose of this study was to assess tick-borne bacteria, whether pathogenic or not, in ticks distributed in Korea using 16S rRNA metabarcoding and to confirm the results by PCR. Questing ticks were collected from four provinces in Korea in 2021 using the flagging method. After pooling the DNAs from the 61 tick pools (including 372 ticks), the bacterial 16S rRNA V3-V4 hypervariable region was amplified and sequenced using the MiSeq platform. Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, and the endosymbiont Wolbachia were confirmed by conventional PCR and molecular analysis. In total, 6907 ticks (534 pools) were collected and identified as belonging to five species (Haemaphysalis spp., H. longicornis, H. flava, I. nipponensis, and A. testudinarium). Through 16S rRNA metabarcoding, 240 amplicon sequence variants were identified. The dominant taxa were Rickettsiella and Coxiella. Additionally, pathogenic bacteria such as Rickettsia and Ehrlichia, endosymbiotic bacteria such as Wolbachia and Spiroplasma were identified. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to confirm the presence of Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, Bartonella, and Wolbachia in individual ticks. Overall, 352 (65.92%) of 534 pools tested positive for at least one of the screened tick-borne bacteria. Rickettsia was the most prevalent (61.42%), followed by Wolbachia (5.05%). Ehrlichia was detected in 4.86% of tested samples, whereas Bartonella was not detected. In this study, 16S rRNA metabarcoding revealed the presence of Rickettsia, Wolbachia, and Ehrlichia, in that order of abundance, while showing absence of Bartonella. These results were confirmed to exhibit the same trend as that of the conventional PCR. Therefore, large-scale screening studies based on pooling, as applied in this study, will be useful for examining novel or rare pathogens present in various hosts and vectors.

Dust samples were collected from Irish homes. House Dust Mite and storage mites were separated from the dust. The microbiome and resistome of mites and originating dust were assessed using a culture-independent approach. The bacterial microbiome of mites and dust were predominantly populated by Staphylococci. There was a highly significant (P = 0.005; Spearman's rank test) correlation between the bacterial microbiome of mites and the dust. One-hundred and eighteen antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were associated with mites and 176 with dust. Both contained ARGs encoding resistance for multi drug resistances, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B, mobile genetic elements, Beta-lactam, Tetracycline and Aminoglycosides. By contrast, 15 ARGs were found for a laboratory-grown strain of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. A significant difference (P = 0.03; t test) was found in means between the resistome of mites and the household dust from which they emanated. No significant correlations (P = 0.23 and P = 0.22; Mantel test) were observed between the microbiome and resistome of mite and dust samples. There was not a significant difference (P = 0.54; t-test) between the means of ARGs for homes with and without a history of antibiotic use.

## Social environment influences microbiota and potentially pathogenic bacterial communities on the skin of developing birds.
 17.08.2024, _E Martínez-Renau, AM Martín-Platero, KH Bodawatta, M Martín-Vivaldi, M Martínez-Bueno, M Poulsen, JJ Soler_


Animal bacterial symbionts are established early in life, either through vertical transmission and/or by horizontal transmission from both the physical and the social environment, such as direct contact with con- or heterospecifics. The social environment particularly can influence the acquisition of both mutualistic and pathogenic bacteria, with consequences for the stability of symbiotic communities. However, segregating the effects of the shared physical environment from those of the social interactions is challenging, limiting our current knowledge on the role of the social environment in structuring bacterial communities in wild animals. Here, we take advantage of the avian brood-parasite system of Eurasian magpies (Pica pica) and great spotted cuckoos (Clamator glandarius) to explore how the interspecific social environment (magpie nestlings developing with or without heterospecifics) affects bacterial communities on uropygial gland skin.

## 16S amplicon-based microbiome biomapping of a commercial broiler hatchery.
 12.08.2024, _MJ Rothrock, B Zwirzitz, WG Al Hakeem, A Oladeinde, JY Guard, X Li_


Hatcheries, where eggs from multiple breeder farms are incubated and hatched before being sent to different broiler farms, represent a nexus point in the commercial production of broilers in the United States. Considering all downstream microbial quality and safety aspects of broiler production (live production, processing, consumer use) can be potentially affected by the hatchery, a better understanding of microbial ecology within commercial hatcheries is essential. Therefore, a commercial broiler hatchery was biomapped using 16S rRNA amplicon-based microbiome analyses of four sample type categories (Air, Egg, Water, Facility) across five different places in the pre-hatch, hatch, and post-hatch areas. While distinct microbiota were found for each sample type category and hatchery area, microbial community analyses revealed that Egg microbiota trended towards clustering with the facility-related samples when moving from the prehatch to post-hatch areas, highlighting the potential effect of the hatchery environment in shaping the pre-harvest broiler-related microbiota. Prevalence analyses revealed 20 ASVs (Core20) present in the core microbiota of all sample types and areas, with each ASV possessing a unique distribution throughout the hatchery. Interestingly, three Enterobacteriaceae ASVs were in the Core20, including Salmonella. Subsequent analyses showed that Salmonella, while a minor prehatch and hatch Core20ASV, dominated the Enterobacteriaceae niche and total microbiota in the chick pad feces in the post-hatch area of the hatchery, and the presence of this Salmonella ASV in the post-hatch feces was associated with swabs of breakroom tables. These findings highlight the complexity of commercial hatchery microbiota, including identifying chick pad feces and breakroom tables as potentially important sampling or disinfection targets for hatchery managers to focus their Salmonella mitigation efforts to reduce loads entering live production farms.

## Adaptation strategies of giant viruses to low-temperature marine ecosystems.
 23.08.2024, _M Buscaglia, JL Iriarte, F Schulz, B Díez_


Microbes in marine ecosystems have evolved their gene content to thrive successfully in the cold. Although this process has been reasonably well studied in bacteria and selected eukaryotes, less is known about the impact of cold environments on the genomes of viruses that infect eukaryotes. Here, we analyzed cold adaptations in giant viruses (Nucleocytoviricota and Mirusviricota) from austral marine environments and compared them with their Arctic and temperate counterparts. We recovered giant virus metagenome-assembled genomes (98 Nucleocytoviricota and 12 Mirusviricota MAGs) from 61 newly sequenced metagenomes and metaviromes from sub-Antarctic Patagonian fjords and Antarctic seawater samples. When analyzing our data set alongside Antarctic and Arctic giant viruses MAGs already deposited in the Global Ocean Eukaryotic Viral (GOEV) database, we found that Antarctic and Arctic giant viruses predominantly inhabit sub-10°C environments, featuring a high proportion of unique phylotypes in each ecosystem. In contrast, giant viruses in Patagonian fjords were subject to broader temperature ranges and showed a lower degree of endemicity. However, despite differences in their distribution, giant viruses inhabiting low-temperature marine ecosystems evolved genomic cold-adaptation strategies that led to changes in genetic functions and amino acid frequencies that ultimately affect both gene content and protein structure. Such changes seem to be absent in their mesophilic counterparts. The uniqueness of these cold-adapted marine giant viruses may now be threatened by climate change, leading to a potential reduction in their biodiversity.

Despite being among the most abundant biological entities on earth, bacteriophage (phage) remain an understudied component of host-associated systems. One limitation to studying host-associated phage is the lack of consensus on methods for sampling phage communities. Here, we compare paired total metagenomes and viral size fraction metagenomes (viromes) as methods for investigating the dsDNA viral communities associated with the GI tract of two bee species: the European honey bee Apis mellifera and the eastern bumble bee Bombus impatiens.

## Soil health is associated with higher primary productivity across Europe.

Soil health is expected to be of key importance for plant growth and ecosystem functioning. However, whether soil health is linked to primary productivity across environmental gradients and land-use types remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted a pan-European field study including 588 sites from 27 countries to investigate the link between soil health and primary productivity across three major land-use types: woodlands, grasslands and croplands. We found that mean soil health (a composite index based on soil properties, biodiversity and plant disease control) in woodlands was 31.4% higher than in grasslands and 76.1% higher than in croplands. Soil health was positively linked to cropland and grassland productivity at the continental scale, whereas climate best explained woodland productivity. Among microbial diversity indicators, we observed a positive association between the richness of Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and primary productivity. Among microbial functional groups, we found that primary productivity in croplands and grasslands was positively related to nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi and negatively related to plant pathogens. Together, our results point to the importance of soil biodiversity and soil health for maintaining primary productivity across contrasting land-use types.

Continuous monocropping obstacles are common in plants, especially medicinal plants, resulting in disease outbreaks and productivity reductions. Foliar disease, mainly caused by Fusarium oxysporum, results in a severe decrease in the yield of Pseudostellaria heterophylla annually. Determining an effective biomethod to alleviate this disease is urgently needed to improve its productivity and quality.

Our 24-month study used metagenomics to investigate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) abundance in raw sewage from wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) in two municipalities in Gauteng Province, South Africa. At the AMR class level, data showed similar trends at all WWTWs, showing that aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance was most abundant. AMR abundance differences were shown between municipalities, where Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality (TMM) WWTWs showed overall higher abundance of AMR compared to Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (EMM) WWTWs. Also, within each municipality, there were differing trends in AMR abundance. Notably, within TMM, certain AMR classes (macrolides and macrolides_streptogramin B) were in higher abundance at a WWTW serving an urban high-income area, while other AMR classes (aminoglycosides) were in higher abundance at a WWTW serving a semi-urban low income area. At the AMR gene level, all WWTWs samples showed the most abundance for the sul1 gene (encoding sulfonamide resistance). Following this, the next 14 most abundant genes encoded resistance to sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines and beta-lactams. Notably, within TMM, some macrolide-encoding resistance genes (mefC, msrE, mphG and mphE) were in highest abundance at a WWTW serving an urban high-income area; while sul1, sul2 and tetC genes were in highest abundance at a WWTW serving a semi-urban low income area. Differential abundance analysis of AMR genes at WWTWs, following stratification of data by season, showed some notable variance in six AMR genes, of which blaKPC-2 and blaKPC-34 genes showed the highest prevalence of seasonal abundance differences when comparing data within a WWTW. The general trend was to see higher abundances of AMR genes in colder seasons, when comparing seasonal data within a WWTW. Our study investigated wastewater samples in only one province of South Africa, from WWTWs located within close proximity to one another. We would require a more widespread investigation at WWTWs distributed across all regions/provinces of South Africa, in order to describe a more comprehensive profile of AMR abundance across the country.

## Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria adapted to low oxygen conditions dominate nitrite oxidation in marine oxygen minimum zones.
 14.08.2024, _SG Fortin, X Sun, A Jayakumar, BB Ward_


Nitrite is a central molecule in the nitrogen cycle because nitrite oxidation to nitrate (an aerobic process) retains fixed nitrogen in a system and its reduction to dinitrogen gas (anaerobic) reduces the fixed nitrogen inventory. Despite its acknowledged requirement for oxygen, nitrite oxidation is observed in oxygen-depleted layers of the ocean's oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), challenging the current understanding of OMZ nitrogen cycling. Previous attempts to determine whether nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in the anoxic layer differ from known nitrite oxidizers in the open ocean were limited by cultivation difficulties and sequencing depth. Here, we construct 31 draft genomes of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria from global OMZs. The distribution of nitrite oxidation rates, abundance and expression of nitrite oxidoreductase genes, and relative abundance of nitrite-oxidizing bacterial draft genomes from the same samples all show peaks in the core of the oxygen-depleted zone (ODZ) and are all highly correlated in depth profiles within the major ocean oxygen minimum zones. The ODZ nitrite oxidizers are not found in the Tara Oceans global dataset (the most complete oxic ocean dataset), and the major nitrite oxidizers found in the oxygenated ocean do not occur in ODZ waters. A pangenomic analysis shows the ODZ nitrite oxidizers have distinct gene clusters compared to oxic nitrite oxidizers and are microaerophilic. These findings all indicate the existence of nitrite oxidizers whose niche is oxygen-deficient seawater. Thus, specialist nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are responsible for fixed nitrogen retention in marine oxygen minimum zones, with implications for control of the ocean's fixed nitrogen inventory.

## Niche separation in bacterial communities and activities in porewater, loosely attached, and firmly attached fractions in permeable surface sediments.

Heterotrophic microbes are central to organic matter degradation and transformation in marine sediments. Currently, most investigations of benthic microbiomes do not differentiate between processes in the porewater and on the grains and, hence, only show a generalized picture of the community. This limits our understanding of the structure and functions of sediment microbiomes. To address this problem, we fractionated sandy surface sediment microbial communities from a coastal site in Isfjorden, Svalbard, into cells associated with the porewater, loosely attached to grains, and firmly attached to grains; we found dissimilar bacterial communities and metabolic activities in these fractions. Most (84%-89%) of the cells were firmly attached, and this fraction comprised more anaerobes, such as sulfate reducers, than the other fractions. The porewater and loosely attached fractions (3% and 8%-13% of cells, respectively) had more aerobic heterotrophs. These two fractions generally showed a higher frequency of dividing cells, polysaccharide (laminarin) hydrolysis rates, and per-cell O2 consumption than the firmly attached cells. Thus, the different fractions occupy distinct niches within surface sediments: the firmly attached fraction is potentially made of cells colonizing areas on the grain that are protected from abrasion, but might be more diffusion-limited for organic matter and electron acceptors. In contrast, the porewater and loosely attached fractions are less resource-limited and have faster growth. Their cell numbers are kept low possibly through abrasion and exposure to grazers. Differences in community composition and activity of these cell fractions point to their distinct roles and contributions to carbon cycling within surface sediments.

## Intestinal organ chips for disease modelling and personalized medicine.
 27.08.2024, _A Özkan, NT LoGrande, JF Feitor, G Goyal, DE Ingber_


Alterations in intestinal structure, mechanics and physiology underlie acute and chronic intestinal conditions, many of which are influenced by dysregulation of microbiome, peristalsis, stroma or immune responses. Studying human intestinal physiology or pathophysiology is difficult in preclinical animal models because their microbiomes and immune systems differ from those of humans. Although advances in organoid culture partially overcome this challenge, intestinal organoids still lack crucial features that are necessary to study functions central to intestinal health and disease, such as digestion or fluid flow, as well as contributions from long-term effects of living microbiome, peristalsis and immune cells. Here, we review developments in organ-on-a-chip (organ chip) microfluidic culture models of the human intestine that are lined by epithelial cells and interfaced with other tissues (such as stroma or endothelium), which can experience both fluid flow and peristalsis-like motions. Organ chips offer powerful ways to model intestinal physiology and disease states for various human populations and individual patients, and can be used to gain new insight into underlying molecular and biophysical mechanisms of disease. They can also be used as preclinical tools to discover new drugs and then validate their therapeutic efficacy and safety in the same human-relevant model.

In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of microbial genomes reconstructed through shotgun sequencing, and obtained by newly developed approaches including metagenomic binning and single-cell sequencing. However, our ability to functionally characterize these genomes by experimental assays is orders of magnitude less efficient. Consequently, there is a pressing need for the development of swift and automated strategies for the functional classification of microbial genomes.

Commonly used approaches for genomic investigation of bacterial outbreaks, including SNP and gene-by-gene approaches, are limited by the requirement for background genomes and curated allele schemes, respectively. As a result, they only work on a select subset of known organisms, and fail on novel or less studied pathogens. We introduce refMLST, a gene-by-gene approach using the reference genome of a bacterium to form a scalable, reproducible and robust method to perform outbreak investigation.
