 20.03.2020, _S Bodapati, TP Daley, X Lin, J Zou, LS Qi_


Genome-wide pooled CRISPR-Cas-mediated knockout, activation, and repression screens are powerful tools for functional genomic investigations. Despite their increasing importance, there is currently little guidance on how to design and analyze CRISPR-pooled screens. Here, we provide a review of the commonly used algorithms in the computational analysis of pooled CRISPR screens. We develop a comprehensive simulation framework to benchmark and compare the performance of these algorithms using both synthetic and real datasets. Our findings inform parameter choices of CRISPR screens and provide guidance to researchers on the design and analysis of pooled CRISPR screens.

## The trisaccharide melezitose impacts honey bees and their intestinal microbiota.
 15.04.2020, _VC Seeburger, P D'Alvise, B Shaaban, K Schweikert, G Lohaus, A Schroeder, M Hasselmann_


In general, honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) feed on honey produced from collected nectar. In the absence of nectar, during certain times of the year or in monocultural landscapes, honey bees forage on honeydew. Honeydew is excreted by different herbivores of the order Hemiptera that consume phloem sap of plant species. In comparison to nectar, honeydew is composed of a higher variety of sugars and additional sugars with higher molecular weight, like the trisaccharide melezitose that can be a major constituent of honeydew. However, melezitose-containing honey is known to cause malnutrition in overwintering honey bees. Following the hypothesis that melezitose may be the cause for the so called 'honeydew flow disease', three independent feeding experiments with caged bees were conducted in consecutive years. Bees fed with melezitose showed increased food uptake, higher gut weights and elevated mortality compared to bees fed a control diet. Moreover, severe disease symptoms, such as swollen abdomen, abdomen tipping and impaired movement were observed in melezitose-fed bees. 16S-amplicon sequencing indicated that the melezitose diet changed the species composition of the lactic acid bacteria community within the gut microbiota. Based on these results, we conclude that melezitose cannot be easily digested by the host and may accumulate in the hindgut. Within cages or during winter, when there is no opportunity for excretion, the accumulated melezitose can cause severe intestinal symptoms and death of the bees, probably as result of poor melezitose metabolism capabilities in the intestinal microbiota. These findings confirm the causal relation between the trisaccharide melezitose and the honeydew flow disease and indicate a possible mechanism of pathogenesis.

## Fecal shedding of Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridioides difficile in dogs fed raw meat-based diets in Brazil and their owners' motivation.
 14.04.2020, _FM Viegas, CP Ramos, RGC Xavier, EO Lopes, CAO Júnior, RM Bagno, AN Diniz, FCF Lobato, ROS Silva_


The present study aimed to explore the motivations of Brazilian dog owners and their knowledge about the risks related to raw meat-based diets (RMBD) as well as to evaluate important enteropathogens such as Salmonella spp., C. perfringens, and C. difficile, in feces of dogs fed different diets. The majority of the pet owners (69.3%) reported to have chosen this diet for their dogs, considering it to be more "natural". A large number of owners declared that RMBD do not pose health risks for their animals (87.9%) or humans (98.8%), even though almost one third of the respondents (34.8%) declared having at least one individual at high risk of infection in contact with RMBD-fed dogs. Stool samples from 46 RMBD-fed dogs and 192 dogs fed commercial dry feed were collected. The present study revealed that dogs fed raw meat diets were almost 30 times more likely to be positive for Salmonella spp. than dogs on a conventional diet. Some of the serovars detected were commonly associated with human salmonellosis, such as S. Typhimurium and S. Saintpaul, and were multidrug resistant. RMBD-fed dogs were more likely to be positive for C. perfringens type A (p = 0.008) and one C. perfringens type F was isolated from these animals. Two toxigenic strains (4.3%) of C. difficile were isolated only from raw meat-fed dogs, all of which were under antibiotic therapy. These toxigenic C. difficile isolates were classified as RT106/ST54 and RT600/ST149, previously associated with infection in dogs and humans. The present work revealed that the owners have a tendency to ignore or are unaware of the risks associated with raw meat diets for dogs. Also, the higher fecal shedding of important enteropathogens in dogs fed RMBD suggests that this diet poses a risk for the animals and the people in contact with them.

## Mechanistic molecular responses of the giant clam Tridacna crocea to Vibrio coralliilyticus challenge.
 15.04.2020, _D Xu, Z Zhao, Z Zhou, Y Lin, X Zhang, Y Zhang, Y Zhang, J Li, F Mao, S Xiao, H Ma, X Zhiming, Z Yu_


Vibrio coralliilyticus is a pathogen of coral and mollusk, contributing to dramatic losses worldwide. In our study, we found that V. coralliilyticus challenge could directly affect adult Tridacna crocea survival; there were dead individuals appearing at 6 h post infection, and there were 45.56% and 56.78% mortality rates in challenged groups after 36 h of infection. The apoptosis rate of hemocytes was significantly increased by 1.8-fold at 6 h after V. coralliilyticus injection. To shed light on the mechanistic molecular responses of T. crocea to V. coralliilyticus infection, we used transcriptome sequencing analysis and other relevant techniques to analyze T. crocea hemocytes at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after V. coralliilyticus challenge. Our results revealed that the total numbers of unigenes and DEGs were 195651 and 3446, respectively. Additional details were found by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, where DEGs were significantly enriched in immune-related signaling pathways, such as the TLR signaling pathway, and some were associated with signaling related to apoptosis. Quantitative validation results illustrated that with exposure to V. coralliilyticus, the expression of TLR pathway members, TLR, MyD88, IRAK4, TRAF6, and IкB-α, were significantly upregulated (by 22.9-, 9.6-, 4.0-, 3.6-, and 3.9-fold, respectively) at 6 h. The cytokine-related gene IL-17 exhibited an increase of 6.3-fold and 10.5-fold at 3 h and 6 h, respectively. The apoptosis-related gene IAP1 was dramatically increased by 2.99-fold at 6 h. These results indicate that adult T. crocea could initiate the TLR pathway to resist V. coralliilyticus, which promotes the release of inflammatory factors such as IL-17 and leads to the activation of a series of outcomes, such as apoptosis. The response mechanism is related to the T. crocea immunoreaction stimulated by V. coralliilyticus, providing a theoretical basis for understanding T. crocea immune response mechanisms.

The recent emergence of bat-borne zoonotic viruses warrants vigilant surveillance in their natural hosts. Of particular concern is the family of coronaviruses, which includes the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an epidemic of acute respiratory illness originating from Wuhan, China in December 2019. Viral detection, discovery, and surveillance activities were undertaken in Myanmar to identify viruses in animals at high risk contact interfaces with people. Free-ranging bats were captured, and rectal and oral swabs and guano samples collected for coronaviral screening using broadly reactive consensus conventional polymerase chain reaction. Sequences from positives were compared to known coronaviruses. Three novel alphacoronaviruses, three novel betacoronaviruses, and one known alphacoronavirus previously identified in other southeast Asian countries were detected for the first time in bats in Myanmar. Ongoing land use change remains a prominent driver of zoonotic disease emergence in Myanmar, bringing humans into ever closer contact with wildlife, and justifying continued surveillance and vigilance at broad scales.

## Plant microbiome analysis after Metarhizium amendment reveals increases in abundance of plant growth-promoting organisms and maintenance of disease-suppressive soil.
 15.04.2020, _L Barelli, AS Waller, SW Behie, MJ Bidochka_


The microbial community in the plant rhizosphere is vital to plant productivity and disease resistance. Alterations in the composition and diversity of species within this community could be detrimental if microbes suppressing the activity of pathogens are removed. Species of the insect-pathogenic fungus, Metarhizium, commonly employed as biological control agents against crop pests, have recently been identified as plant root colonizers and provide a variety of benefits (e.g. growth promotion, drought resistance, nitrogen acquisition). However, the impact of Metarhizium amendment on the rhizosphere microbiome has yet to be elucidated. Using Illumina sequencing, we examined the community profiles (bacteria and fungi) of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) rhizosphere (loose soil and plant root) after amendment with M. robertsii conidia, in the presence and absence of an insect host. Although alpha diversity was not significantly affected overall, there were numerous examples of plant growth-promoting organisms that significantly increased with Metarhizium amendment (Bradyrhizobium, Flavobacterium, Chaetomium, Trichoderma). Specifically, the abundance of Bradyrhizobium, a group of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, was confirmed to be increased using a qPCR assay with genus-specific primers. In addition, the ability of the microbiome to suppress the activity of a known bean root pathogen was assessed. The development of disease symptoms after application with Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli was visible in the hypocotyl and upper root of plants grown in sterilized soil but was suppressed during growth in microbiome soil and soil treated with M. robertsii. Successful amendment of agricultural soils with biocontrol agents such as Metarhizium necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the effects on the diversity of the rhizosphere microbiome. Such research is fundamentally important towards sustainable agricultural practices to improve overall plant health and productivity.

## The genome evolution and domestication of tropical fruit mango.
 20.03.2020, _P Wang, Y Luo, J Huang, S Gao, G Zhu, Z Dang, J Gai, M Yang, M Zhu, H Zhang, X Ye, A Gao, X Tan, S Wang, S Wu, EB Cahoon, B Bai, Z Zhao, Q Li, J Wei, H Chen, R Luo, D Gong, K Tang, B Zhang, Z Ni, G Huang, S Hu, Y Chen_


Mango is one of the world's most important tropical fruits. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes several other economically important species, notably cashew, sumac and pistachio from other genera. Many species in this family produce family-specific urushiols and related phenols, which can induce contact dermatitis.
