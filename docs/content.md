## Behavior of motor units during submaximal isometric contractions in chronically strength-trained individuals.
 11.11.2021, _A Casolo, A Del Vecchio, TG Balshaw, S Maeo, MB Lanza, F Felici, JP Folland, D Farina_


Neural and morphological adaptations combine to underpin the enhanced muscle strength following prolonged exposure to strength training, although their relative importance remains unclear. We investigated the contribution of motor unit (MU) behavior and muscle size to submaximal force production in chronically strength-trained athletes (ST) versus untrained controls (UT). Sixteen ST (age: 22.9 ± 3.5 yr; training experience: 5.9 ± 3.5 yr) and 14 UT (age: 20.4 ± 2.3 yr) performed maximal voluntary isometric force (MViF) and ramp contractions (at 15%, 35%, 50%, and 70% MViF) with elbow flexors, whilst high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) was recorded from the biceps brachii (BB). Recruitment thresholds (RTs) and discharge rates (DRs) of MUs identified from the submaximal contractions were assessed. The neural drive-to-muscle gain was estimated from the relation between changes in force (ΔFORCE, i.e. muscle output) relative to changes in MU DR (ΔDR, i.e. neural input). BB maximum anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSAMAX) was also assessed by MRI. MViF (+64.8% vs. UT, P &lt; 0.001) and BB ACSAMAX (+71.9%, P &lt; 0.001) were higher in ST. Absolute MU RT was higher in ST (+62.6%, P &lt; 0.001), but occurred at similar normalized forces. MU DR did not differ between groups at the same normalized forces. The absolute slope of the ΔFORCE - ΔDR relationship was higher in ST (+66.9%, P = 0.002), whereas it did not differ for normalized values. We observed similar MU behavior between ST athletes and UT controls. The greater absolute force-generating capacity of ST for the same neural input demonstrates that morphological, rather than neural, factors are the predominant mechanism for their enhanced force generation during submaximal efforts.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY In this study, we observed that recruitment strategies and discharge characteristics of large populations of motor units identified from biceps brachii of strength-trained athletes were similar to those observed in untrained individuals during submaximal force tasks. We also found that for the same neural input, strength-trained athletes are able to produce greater absolute muscle forces (i.e., neural drive-to-muscle gain). This demonstrates that morphological factors are the predominant mechanism for the enhanced force generation during submaximal efforts.

Scabies is a neglected tropical disease hyperendemic to many low- and middle-income countries. Scabies can be successfully controlled using mass drug administration (MDA) using 2 doses of ivermectin-based treatment. If effective, a strategy of 1-dose ivermectin-based MDA would have substantial advantages for implementing MDA for scabies at large scale.

## Charting host-microbe co-metabolism in skin aging and application to metagenomics data.
 10.11.2021, _W Alkema, J Boekhorst, RT Eijlander, S Schnittger, F De Gruyter, S Lukovac, K Schilling, GAM Kortman_


During aging of human skin, a number of intrinsic and extrinsic factors cause the alteration of the skin's structure, function and cutaneous physiology. Many studies have investigated the influence of the skin microbiome on these alterations, but the molecular mechanisms that dictate the interplay between these factors and the skin microbiome are still not fully understood. To obtain more insight into the connection between the skin microbiome and the human physiological processes involved in skin aging, we performed a systematic study on interconnected pathways of human and bacterial metabolic processes that are known to play a role in skin aging. The bacterial genes in these pathways were subsequently used to create Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which were applied to screen for presence of defined functionalities in both genomic and metagenomic datasets of skin-associated bacteria. These models were further applied on 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from skin microbiota samples derived from female volunteers of two different age groups (25-28 years ('young') and 59-68 years ('old')). The results show that the main bacterial pathways associated with aging skin are those involved in the production of pigmentation intermediates, fatty acids and ceramides. This study furthermore provides evidence for a relation between skin aging and bacterial enzymes involved in protein glycation. Taken together, the results and insights described in this paper provide new leads for intervening with bacterial processes that are associated with aging of human skin.

## What not to use in bipolar disorders: a systematic review of non-recommended treatments in clinical practice guidelines.
 10.11.2021, _FA Gomes, RO Cerqueira, Y Lee, RB Mansur, F Kapczinski, RS McIntyre, LN Yatham, M Berk, R Milev, E Brietzke_


Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are an important tool for implementation of evidence-based clinical care. Despite clinical trials showing lack of efficacy of some agents in bipolar disorder (BD), they are still frequently prescribed in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to systematically review the CPG recommendations on pharmacological interventions with evidence against their use due to lack of efficacy data and/or due to serious safety concerns.

## [A comparative study on the difference of gut microbiota and its biomarkers between patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and healthy controls].
 10.11.2021, _YH Lu, WP Shi, Y Hu, F Xia, Z Ning, MY Wu, C Chen, Y O Hu, B Xu_


Objective: To analyze the differences in the composition and abundance of gut microbiota between patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and healthy controls, and to identify the specific bacteria as biomarkers to distinguish between the two groups. Methods: Patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis treated in three municipal designated tuberculosis medical institutions in Sichuan, Jiangsu and Shanghai from September 2017 to September 2019 were selected as the case group (n=88), and the healthy people without a history of tuberculosis from the same regions were recruited as the control group (n=62). The fecal samples of the two groups were detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the differences of gut microbiota diversity, community composition and relative abundance at phylum and genus level from the two groups were analyzed. The random forest method was used to construct a predictive model to assess whether the specific bacterial flora could be used as biomarkers to distinguish tuberculosis patients from healthy people. Results: The alpha diversity analysis showed that the species richness and evenness of gut microbiota in tuberculosis patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls (P&lt;0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in the composition of microbiota between the two groups (Bray-Curtis distance, P&lt;0.001). In the gut microbiota of tuberculosis patients, opportunistic pathogens were relatively enriched, while some of the beneficial bacteria that can produce short-chain fatty acids were less abundant. The discrimination accuracy of the random forest model composed of Lachnospira, Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group and Roseburia was 76.67%, with area under the curve (AUC) being 75.29% (95%CI: 0.661-0.845). Conclusion: There were differences in gut microbiota between patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and healthy people, and specific bacterial flora showed the potential to be used as biomarkers to distinguish between the two groups.

## [The preventive effect of four drugs on acute mountain sickness: a Bayesian network meta-analysis].
 10.11.2021, _HL Yang, MJ Deng, W Zhang, S Huang_


Objective: To compare and predict the preventive effects of acetazolamide and other drugs on acute mountain sickness(AMS). Methods: Following the retrieval strategy of PRISMA statement of systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, etc. from January 1, 1980 to November 30, 2020, and randomized controlled trials (RCT) consistent with drug prevention of AMS were conducted. Using R and other statistical software, Markov chain-Monte Carlo method was carried out for network meta-analysis under Bayesian framework, and node separation method was performed to check the consistency of closed-loop research. Results: Twenty-three literatures (25 studies) were included to compare the preventive effects of 4 drugs on AMS. Bayesian network meta-analysis showed that the incidence of AMS in acetazolamide group (ACE), dexamethasone group (DEX), ginkgo biloba extract group (GBE) and rhodiola group (RHO) was lower than that in placebo group (PLA). In the comparison of drug groups, the incidence of AMS in ACE, DEX and RHO was lower than that in GBE. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of AMS among ACE, DEX and RHO groups. Eight of these studies reported the effects of two drugs on pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) in people entering the target altitude. Bayesian network meta-analysis showed that SpO2 in RHO was higher than that in ACE and PLA, but there was no statistically significant difference in SpO2 between ACE and PLA. The probability ranking of prevention AMS effect grade showed that the rank 5th probability of AMS in ACE, DEX, GBE, RHO and PLA was 45.72%, 48.80%, 0, 5.48% and 0, respectively. The probability ranking of improving the SpO2 level of the target altitude population showed that the probability of the ACE, RHO and PLA ranking 1st in improving the SpO2 effect at the target altitude was 2.27%, 97.66% and 0.07%, respectively; the results of direct comparison were in good agreement with those of Bayesian prediction model indirectly, and there was no statistical difference. Conclusions: Acetazolamide and dexamethasone can effectively prevent AMS, and should be the first choice for related supplementary research in the future. Rhodiola not only improves the SpO2 of people entering high altitude, but also reduces the incidence of AMS, which needs more attention. Ginkgo biloba extract is not as effective as the above three drugs in preventing AMS and should be used depending on clinical situations.

## Microbial population genomes from the Amazon River reveal possible modulation of the organic matter degradation process in tropical freshwaters.
 26.10.2021, _CD Santos-Júnior, R Logares, F Henrique-Silva_


Rivers connect the carbon cycle in land with that in aquatic ecosystems by transporting and transforming terrestrial organic matter (TeOM). The Amazon River receives huge loads of TeOM from the surrounding rainforest, promoting a substantial microbial heterotrophic activity and consequently, CO2 outgassing. In the Amazon River, microbes degrade up to 55% of the lignin present in the TeOM. Yet, the main microbial genomes involved in TeOM degradation were unknown. Here, we characterize 51 population genomes (PGs) representing some of the most abundant microbes in the Amazon River deriving from 106 metagenomes. The 51 reconstructed PGs are among the most abundant microbes in the Amazon River, and 53% of them are not able to degrade TeOM. Among the PGs capable of degrading TeOM, 20% were exclusively cellulolytic, while the others could also oxidize lignin. The transport and consumption of lignin oxidation byproducts seemed to be decoupled from the oxidation process, being apparently performed by different groups of microorganisms. By connecting the genomic features of abundant microbes in the Amazon River with the degradation machinery of TeOM, we suggest that a complex microbial consortium could explain the quick turnover of TeOM previously observed in this ecosystem.

## mBodyMap: a curated database for microbes across human body and their associations with health and diseases.
 31.10.2021, _H Jin, G Hu, C Sun, Y Duan, Z Zhang, Z Liu, XM Zhao, WH Chen_


mBodyMap is a curated database for microbes across the human body and their associations with health and diseases. Its primary aim is to promote the reusability of human-associated metagenomic data and assist with the identification of disease-associated microbes by consistently annotating the microbial contents of collected samples using state-of-the-art toolsets and manually curating the meta-data of corresponding human hosts. mBodyMap organizes collected samples based on their association with human diseases and body sites to enable cross-dataset integration and comparison. To help users find microbes of interest and visualize and compare their distributions and abundances/prevalence within different body sites and various diseases, the mBodyMap database is equipped with an intuitive interface and extensive graphical representations of the collected data. So far, it contains a total of 63 148 runs, including 14 401 metagenomes and 48 747 amplicons related to health and 56 human diseases, from within 22 human body sites across 136 projects. Also available in the database are pre-computed abundances and prevalence of 6247 species (belonging to 1645 genera) stratified by body sites and diseases. mBodyMap can be accessed at: https://mbodymap.microbiome.cloud.

## Density-based binning of gene clusters to infer function or evolutionary history using GeneGrouper.
 04.11.2021, _AG McFarland, NW Kennedy, CE Mills, D Tullman-Ercek, C Huttenhower, EM Hartmann_


Identifying variant forms of gene clusters of interest in phylogenetically proximate and distant taxa can help to infer their evolutionary histories and functions. Conserved gene clusters may differ by only a few genes, but these small differences can in turn induce substantial phenotypes, such as by the formation of pseudogenes or insertions interrupting regulation. Particularly as microbial genomes and metagenomic assemblies become increasingly abundant, unsupervised grouping of similar, but not necessarily identical, gene clusters into consistent bins can provide a population-level understanding of their gene content variation and functional homology.
