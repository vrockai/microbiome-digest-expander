A novel coronavirus has caused thousands of human infections in China since December 2019, raising a global public health concern. Recent studies (Huang et al., Chan et al., and Zhou et al.) have provided timely insights into its origin and ability to spread among humans, informing infection prevention and control practices.

In 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infecting Humans has emerged in Wuhan, China. Its genome has been sequenced and the genomic information promptly released. Despite a high similarity with the genome sequence of SARS-CoV and SARS-like CoVs, we identified a peculiar furin-like cleavage site in the Spike protein of the 2019-nCoV, lacking in the other SARS-like CoVs. In this article, we discuss the possible functional consequences of this cleavage site in the viral cycle, pathogenicity and its potential implication in the development of antivirals.

## CD-sACE2 Inclusion Compounds: An Effective Treatment for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
 01.04.2020, _P Sun, X Lu, C Xu, Y Wang, W Sun, J Xi_


ACE2 is a metalloproteinase and a homolog of carboxypeptidase ACE. It hydrolyzes a variety of angiotensin peptides and is the main active peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).[3] ACE2, which is made of 805 amino acids, is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a single extracellular catalytic domain.

## When bacteria meet mitochondria: The strange case of the tick symbiont Midichloria mitochondriiâ€ .
 18.03.2020, _F Stavru, J Riemer, A Jex, D Sassera_


Mitochondria are key eukaryotic organelles that perform several essential functions. Not surprisingly, many intracellular bacteria directly or indirectly target mitochondria, interfering with innate immunity, energy production or apoptosis, to make the host cell a more hospitable niche for bacterial replication. The alphaproteobacterium Midichloria mitochondrii has taken mitochondrial targeting to another level by physically colonising mitochondria, as shown by transmission electron micrographs of bacteria residing in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This unique localization provokes a number of questions around the mechanisms allowing, and reasons driving intramitochondrial tropism. We suggest possible scenarios that could lead to this peculiar localization and hypothesize potential costs and benefits of mitochondrial colonisation for the bacterium and its host.

## Horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in the human gut microbiome.
 10.03.2020, _RS McInnes, GE McCallum, LE Lamberte, W van Schaik_


Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major threat to public health. The pathogens causing these infections can acquire antibiotic resistance genes in a process termed horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT is a common event in the human gut microbiome, that is, the microbial ecosystem of the human intestinal tract. HGT in the gut microbiome can occur via different mechanisms of which transduction and conjugation have been best characterised. Novel bioinformatic tools and experimental approaches have been developed to determine the association of antibiotic resistance genes with their microbial hosts and to quantify the extent of HGT in the gut microbiome. Insights from studies into HGT in the gut microbiome may lead to the development of novel interventions to minimise the spread of antibiotic resistance genes among commensals and opportunistic pathogens.
