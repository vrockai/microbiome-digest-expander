Microbially derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the human gut are tightly coupled to host metabolism, immune regulation and integrity of the intestinal epithelium. However, the production of SCFAs can vary widely between individuals consuming the same diet, with lower levels often associated with disease. A systems-scale mechanistic understanding of this heterogeneity is lacking. Here we use a microbial community-scale metabolic modelling (MCMM) approach to predict individual-specific SCFA production profiles to assess the impact of different dietary, prebiotic and probiotic inputs. We evaluate the quantitative accuracy of our MCMMs using in vitro and ex vivo data, plus published human cohort data. We find that MCMM SCFA predictions are significantly associated with blood-derived clinical chemistries, including cardiometabolic and immunological health markers, across a large human cohort. Finally, we demonstrate how MCMMs can be leveraged to design personalized dietary, prebiotic and probiotic interventions aimed at optimizing SCFA production in the gut. Our model represents an approach to direct gut microbiome engineering for precision health and nutrition.

## Island biogeography theory provides a plausible explanation for why larger vertebrates and taller humans have more diverse gut microbiomes.
 21.06.2024, _KR Sarmiento, A Carr, C Diener, KJ Locey, SM Gibbons_


Prior work has shown a positive scaling relationship between vertebrate body size, human height, and gut microbiome alpha diversity. This observation mirrors commonly observed species area relationships (SAR) in many other ecosystems. Here, we expand these observations to several large data sets, showing that this size-diversity scaling relationship is independent of relevant covariates, like diet, body mass index, age, sex, bowel movement frequency, antibiotic usage, and cardiometabolic health markers. Island biogeography theory (IBT), which predicts that larger islands tend to harbor greater species diversity through neutral demographic processes, provides a simple mechanism for positive SARs. Using gut-adapted IBT model, we demonstrated that increasing the length of a flow-through ecosystem led to increased species diversity, closely matching our empirical observations. We delve into the possible clinical implications of these SARs in the American Gut cohort. Consistent with prior observations that lower alpha diversity is a risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), we found that individuals who reported a history of CDI were shorter than those who did not and that this relationship was mediated by alpha diversity. We observed that vegetable consumption had a much stronger association with CDI history, which was also partially mediated by alpha diversity. In summary, we find that the positive scaling observed between body size and gut alpha diversity can be plausibly explained by a gut-adapted IBT model, may be related to CDI risk, and vegetable intake appears to independently mitigate this risk, although additional work is needed to validate the potential disease risk implications.

## Dietary fibre directs microbial tryptophan metabolism via metabolic interactions in the gut microbiota.
 25.06.2024, _AK Sinha, MF Laursen, JE Brinck, ML Rybtke, AP Hjørne, N Procházková, M Pedersen, HM Roager, TR Licht_


Tryptophan is catabolized by gut microorganisms resulting in a wide range of metabolites implicated in both beneficial and adverse host effects. How gut microbial tryptophan metabolism is directed towards indole, associated with chronic kidney disease, or towards protective indolelactic acid (ILA) and indolepropionic acid (IPA) is unclear. Here we used in vitro culturing and animal experiments to assess gut microbial competition for tryptophan and the resulting metabolites in a controlled three-species defined community and in complex undefined human faecal communities. The generation of specific tryptophan-derived metabolites was not predominantly determined by the abundance of tryptophan-metabolizing bacteria, but rather by substrate-dependent regulation of specific metabolic pathways. Indole-producing Escherichia coli and ILA- and IPA-producing Clostridium sporogenes competed for tryptophan within the three-species community in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, fibre-degrading Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron affected this competition by cross-feeding monosaccharides to E. coli. This inhibited indole production through catabolite repression, thus making more tryptophan available to C. sporogenes, resulting in increased ILA and IPA production. The fibre-dependent reduction in indole was confirmed using human faecal cultures and faecal-microbiota-transplanted gnotobiotic mice. Our findings explain why consumption of fermentable fibres suppresses indole production but promotes the generation of other tryptophan metabolites associated with health benefits.

## Modulation of gut microbiota composition due to early weaning stress induces depressive behavior during the juvenile period in mice.

The gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of behavior and immunity in infants and juveniles. Early weaning (EW), a form of social stress in mice, leads to increased anxiety and an enhanced stress response in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during adulthood. Early life stress also modulates the immune system and increases vulnerability to infection. However, studies investigating the causal relationships among juvenile stress, microbiota changes, and immune and behavioral deficits are limited. Therefore, we hypothesized that EW alters gut microbiota composition and impairs the development of the nervous and immune systems.

## Gut microbiota and immune profiling of microbiota-humanised versus wildtype mouse models of hepatointestinal schistosomiasis.
 25.06.2024, _KA Stark, G Rinaldi, A Costain, S Clare, C Tolley, A Almeida, C McCarthy, K Harcourt, C Brandt, TD Lawley, M Berriman, AS MacDonald, JE Forde-Thomas, BJ Hulme, KF Hoffmann, C Cantacessi, A Cortés_


Mounting evidence of the occurrence of direct and indirect interactions between the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, and the gut microbiota of rodent models raises questions on the potential role(s) of the latter in the pathophysiology of hepatointestinal schistosomiasis. However, substantial differences in both the composition and function between the gut microbiota of laboratory rodents and that of humans hinders an in-depth understanding of the significance of such interactions for human schistosomiasis. Taking advantage of the availability of a human microbiota-associated mouse model (HMA), we have previously highlighted differences in infection-associated changes in gut microbiota composition between HMA and wildtype (WT) mice. To further explore the dynamics of schistosome-microbiota relationships in HMA mice, in this study we (i) characterize qualitative and quantitative changes in gut microbiota composition of a distinct line of HMA mice (D2 HMA) infected with S. mansoni prior to and following the onset of parasite egg production; (ii) profile local and systemic immune responses against the parasite in HMA as well as WT mice and (iii) assess levels of faecal inflammatory markers and occult blood as indirect measures of gut tissue damage. We show that patent S. mansoni infection is associated with reduced bacterial alpha diversity in the gut of D2 HMA mice, alongside expansion of hydrogen sulphide-producing bacteria. Similar systemic humoral responses against S. mansoni in WT and D2 HMA mice, as well as levels of faecal lipocalin and markers of alternatively activated macrophages, suggest that these are independent of baseline gut microbiota composition. Qualitative comparative analyses between faecal microbial profiles of S. mansoni-infected WT and distinct lines of HMA mice reveal that, while infection-induced alterations of the gut microbiota composition are highly dependent on the baseline flora, bile acid composition and metabolism may represent key elements of schistosome-microbiota interactions through the gut-liver axis.

## Analysis of differences in the rumen microbiome and metabolic function in prepartum dairy cows with different body condition scores.
 26.06.2024, _D Du, Y Wang, Y Gao, L Feng, Z Zhang, Z Hu_


The rumen is a crucial digestive organ for dairy cows. The rumen microbiota assists in the digestion of plant feed through microbe-mediated fermentation, during which the plant feed is transformed into nutrients for the cow's use. Variations in the composition and function of the rumen microbiome affect the energy utilization efficiency of dairy cows, which is one of the reasons for the varying body condition scores (BCSs). This study focused on prepartum Holstein dairy cows to analyze differences in rumen microbiota and metabolites among cows with different BCSs. Twelve prepartum dairy cows were divided into two groups, low BCS (LBCS, BCS = 2.75, n = 6) and high BCS (HBCS, BCS = 3.5, n = 6), to explore differences in microbial composition and metabolites.

## Metagenomic insights into Heimdallarchaeia clades from the deep-sea cold seep and hydrothermal vent.
 25.06.2024, _R Liu, R Cai, M Wang, J Zhang, H Zhang, C Li, C Sun_


Heimdallarchaeia is a class of the Asgardarchaeota, are the most probable candidates for the archaeal protoeukaryote ancestor that have been identified to date. However, little is known about their life habits regardless of their ubiquitous distribution in diverse habitats, which is especially true for Heimdallarchaeia from deep-sea environments. In this study, we obtained 13 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of Heimdallarchaeia from the deep-sea cold seep and hydrothermal vent. These MAGs belonged to orders o_Heimdallarchaeales and o_JABLTI01, and most of them (9 MAGs) come from the family f_Heimdallarchaeaceae according to genome taxonomy database (GTDB). These are enriched for common eukaryote-specific signatures. Our results show that these Heimdallarchaeia have the metabolic potential to reduce sulfate (assimilatory) and nitrate (dissimilatory) to sulfide and ammonia, respectively, suggesting a previously unappreciated role in biogeochemical cycling. Furthermore, we find that they could perform both TCA and rTCA pathways coupled with pyruvate metabolism for energy conservation, fix CO2 and generate organic compounds through an atypical Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. In addition, many genes closely associated with bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis, and oxygen-dependent metabolic pathways are identified in these Heimdallarchaeia MAGs, suggesting a potential light-utilization by pigments and microoxic lifestyle. Taken together, our results indicate that Heimdallarchaeia possess a mixotrophic lifestyle, which may give them more flexibility to adapt to the harsh deep-sea conditions.

## Microbial consortium assembly and functional analysis via isotope labelling and single-cell manipulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degraders.
 24.06.2024, _J Li, C Luo, X Cai, D Zhang, G Guan, B Li, G Zhang_


Soil microbial flora constitutes a highly diverse and complex microbiome on Earth, often challenging to cultivation, with unclear metabolic mechanisms in situ. Here, we present a pioneering concept for the in situ construction of functional microbial consortia (FMCs) and introduce an innovative method for creating FMCs by utilising phenanthrene as a model compound to elucidate their in situ biodegradation mechanisms. Our methodology involves single-cell identification, sorting, and culture of functional microorganisms, resulting in the formation of a precise in situ FMC. Through RACS-SIP, we identified and isolated phenanthrene-degrading bacterial cells from Achromobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp., achieving precise and controllable in situ consortia based on genome-guided cultivation. Our in situ FMC outperformed conventionally designed functional flora when tested in real soil, indicating its superior phenanthrene degradation capacity. We revealed that microorganisms with high degradation efficiency isolated through conventional methods may exhibit pollutant tolerance but lack actual degradation ability in natural environments. This finding highlights the potential to construct FMCs based on thorough elucidation of in situ functional degraders, thereby achieving sustained and efficient pollutant degradation. Single-cell sequencing linked degraders with their genes and metabolic pathways, providing insights regarding the construction of in situ FMCs. The consortium in situ comprising microorganisms with diverse phenanthrene metabolic pathways might offer distinct advantages for enhancing phenanthrene degradation efficiency, such as the division of labour and cooperation or communication among microbial species. Our approach underscores the importance of in situ, single-cell precision identification, isolation, and cultivation for comprehensive bacterial functional analysis and resource exploration, which can extend to investigate MFCs in archaea and fungi, clarifying FMC construction methods for element recycling and pollutant transformation in complex real-world ecosystems.

## Chemolithoautotrophic diazotrophs dominate dark nitrogen fixation in mangrove sediments.
 25.06.2024, _S Wang, L Jiang, Z Zhao, Z Chen, J Wang, K Alain, L Cui, Y Zhong, Y Peng, Q Lai, X Dong, Z Shao_


Diazotrophic microorganisms regulate marine productivity by alleviating nitrogen limitation. So far chemolithoautotrophic bacteria are widely recognized as the principal diazotrophs in oligotrophic marine and terrestrial ecosystems. However, the contribution of chemolithoautotrophs to nitrogen fixation in organic-rich habitats remains unclear. Here, we utilized metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches integrated with cultivation assays to investigate the diversity, distribution, and activity of diazotrophs residing in Zhangzhou mangrove sediments. Physicochemical assays show that the studied mangrove sediments are typical carbon-rich, sulfur-rich, nitrogen-limited, and low-redox marine ecosystems. These sediments host a wide phylogenetic variety of nitrogenase genes, including groups I-III and VII-VIII. Unexpectedly diverse chemolithoautotrophic taxa including Campylobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Zetaproteobacteria, and Thermodesulfovibrionia are the predominant and active nitrogen fixers in the 0-18 cm sediment layer. In contrast, the 18-20 cm layer is dominated by active diazotrophs from the chemolithoautotrophic taxa Desulfobacterota and Halobacteriota. Further analysis of MAGs show that the main chemolithoautotrophs can fix nitrogen by coupling the oxidation of hydrogen, reduced sulfur, and iron, with the reduction of oxygen, nitrate, and sulfur. Culture experiments further demonstrate that members of chemolithoautotrophic Campylobacteria have the nitrogen-fixing capacity driven by hydrogen and sulfur oxidation. Activity measurements confirm that the diazotrophs inhabiting mangrove sediments preferentially drain energy from diverse reduced inorganic compounds other than from organics. Overall, our results suggest that chemolithoautotrophs rather than heterotrophs are dominant nitrogen fixers in mangrove sediments. This study underscores the significance of chemolithoautotrophs in carbon-dominant ecosystems.

## Cellular interactions and evolutionary origins of endosymbiotic relationships with ciliates.
 25.06.2024, _Q Song, F Zhao, L Hou, M Miao_


As unicellular predators, ciliates engage in close associations with diverse microbes, laying the foundation for the establishment of endosymbiosis. Originally heterotrophic, ciliates demonstrate the ability to acquire phototrophy by phagocytizing unicellular algae or by sequestering algal plastids. This adaptation enables them to gain photosynthate and develop resistance to unfavorable environmental conditions. The integration of acquired phototrophy with intrinsic phagotrophy results in a trophic mode known as mixotrophy. Additionally, ciliates can harbor thousands of bacteria in various intracellular regions, including the cytoplasm and nucleus, exhibiting species specificity. Under prolonged and specific selective pressure within hosts, bacterial endosymbionts evolve unique lifestyles and undergo particular reductions in metabolic activities. Investigating the research advancements in various endosymbiotic cases within ciliates will contribute to elucidate patterns in cellular interaction and unravel the evolutionary origins of complex traits.

Pan-virus detection, and virome investigation in general, can be challenging, mainly due to the lack of universally conserved genetic elements in viruses. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing can offer a promising solution to this problem by providing an unbiased overview of the microbial community, enabling detection of any viruses without prior target selection. However, a major challenge in utilising metagenomic next-generation sequencing for virome investigation is that data analysis can be highly complex, involving numerous data processing steps.
