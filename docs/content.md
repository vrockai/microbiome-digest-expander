This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Integrating research on bacterial pathogens and commensals to fight infections-an ecological perspective.
 12.04.2024, _L Maier, C Stein-Thoeringer, RE Ley, H Brötz-Oesterhelt, H Link, N Ziemert, S Wagner, A Peschel_


The incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections is increasing, and development of new antibiotics has been deprioritised by the pharmaceutical industry. Interdisciplinary research approaches, based on the ecological principles of bacterial fitness, competition, and transmission, could open new avenues to combat antibiotic-resistant infections. Many facultative bacterial pathogens use human mucosal surfaces as their major reservoirs and induce infectious diseases to aid their lateral transmission to new host organisms under some pathological states of the microbiome and host. Beneficial bacterial commensals can outcompete specific pathogens, thereby lowering the capacity of the pathogens to spread and cause serious infections. Despite the clinical relevance, however, the understanding of commensal-pathogen interactions in their natural habitats remains poor. In this Personal View, we highlight directions to intensify research on the interactions between bacterial pathogens and commensals in the context of human microbiomes and host biology that can lead to the development of innovative and sustainable ways of preventing and treating infectious diseases.

## Recommendations for the Use of Dietary Fiber to Improve Blood Pressure Control.
 08.04.2024, _HA Jama, M Snelson, AE Schutte, J Muir, FZ Marques_


According to several international, regional, and national guidelines on hypertension, lifestyle interventions are the first-line treatment to lower blood pressure (BP). Although diet is one of the major lifestyle modifications described in hypertension guidelines, dietary fiber is not specified. Suboptimal intake of foods high in fiber, such as in Westernized diets, is a major contributing factor to mortality and morbidity of noncommunicable diseases due to higher BP and cardiovascular disease. In this review, we address this deficiency by examining and advocating for the incorporation of dietary fiber as a key lifestyle modification to manage elevated BP. We explain what dietary fiber is, review the existing literature that supports its use to lower BP and prevent cardiovascular disease, describe the mechanisms involved, propose evidence-based target levels of fiber intake, provide examples of how patients can achieve the recommended targets, and discuss outstanding questions in the field. According to the evidence reviewed here, the minimum daily dietary fiber for adults with hypertension should be &gt;28 g/day for women and &gt;38 g/day for men, with each extra 5 g/day estimated to reduce systolic BP by 2.8 mm Hg and diastolic BP by 2.1 mm Hg. This would support a healthy gut microbiota and the production of gut microbiota-derived metabolites called short-chain fatty acids that lower BP. Awareness about dietary fiber targets and how to achieve them will guide medical teams on better educating patients and empowering them to increase their fiber intake and, as a result, lower their BP and cardiovascular disease risk.

## Effect of proteinuria at relapse on shear wave velocity assessed using ultrasound elastography in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.
 13.04.2024, _T Nishino, S Tomori, S Ono, K Takahashi, M Mimaki_


Shear wave velocity (SWV) is an ultrasound elastography technique that provides much information for kidney disease assessment. However, the factors that alter SWV are not fully understood; it is unclear whether the variation in SWV seen in proteinuria associated with disease progression is due to tissue or proteinuria. This study investigated the effect of proteinuria on SWV.

## Intestinal microbiome profiles in broiler chickens raised without antibiotics exhibit altered microbiome dynamics relative to conventionally raised chickens.
 06.04.2024, _SH Kairmi, K Abdelaziz, H Spahany, J Astill, D Trott, B Wang, A Wang, J Parkinson, S Sharif_


_Animals, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Chickens, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Microbiota, Cecum, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes_
The present study was undertaken to profile and compare the cecal microbial communities in conventionally (CONV) grown and raised without antibiotics (RWA) broiler chickens. Three hundred chickens were collected from five CONV and five RWA chicken farms on days 10, 24, and 35 of age. Microbial genomic DNA was extracted from cecal contents, and the V4-V5 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified and sequenced. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequence data indicated significant differences in the cecal microbial diversity and composition between CONV and RWA chickens on days 10, 24, and 35 days of age. On days 10 and 24, CONV chickens had higher richness and diversity of the cecal microbiome relative to RWA chickens. However, on day 35, this pattern reversed such that RWA chickens had higher richness and diversity of the cecal microbiome than the CONV groups. On days 10 and 24, the microbiomes of both CONV and RWA chickens were dominated by members of the phylum Firmicutes. On day 35, while Firmicutes remained dominant in the RWA chickens, the microbiome of CONV chickens exhibited am abundance of Bacteroidetes. The cecal microbiome of CONV chickens was enriched with the genus Faecalibacterium, Pseudoflavonifractor, unclassified Clostridium_IV, Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Butyricimonas, whereas the cecal microbiome of RWA chickens was enriched with genus Anaerofilum, Butyricicoccu, Clostridium_XlVb and unclassified Lachnospiraceae. Overall, the cecal microbiome richness, diversity, and composition were greatly influenced by the management program applied in these farms. These findings provide a foundation for further research on tailoring feed formulation or developing a consortium to modify the gut microbiome composition of RWA chickens.

## Decoding populations in the ocean microbiome.
 04.04.2024, _R Logares_


_Animals, Ecosystem, Microbiota, Oceans and Seas, Metagenomics_
Understanding the characteristics and structure of populations is fundamental to comprehending ecosystem processes and evolutionary adaptations. While the study of animal and plant populations has spanned a few centuries, microbial populations have been under scientific scrutiny for a considerably shorter period. In the ocean, analyzing the genetic composition of microbial populations and their adaptations to multiple niches can yield important insights into ecosystem function and the microbiome's response to global change. However, microbial populations have remained elusive to the scientific community due to the challenges associated with isolating microorganisms in the laboratory. Today, advancements in large-scale metagenomics and metatranscriptomics facilitate the investigation of populations from many uncultured microbial species directly from their habitats. The knowledge acquired thus far reveals substantial genetic diversity among various microbial species, showcasing distinct patterns of population differentiation and adaptations, and highlighting the significant role of selection in structuring populations. In the coming years, population genomics is expected to significantly increase our understanding of the architecture and functioning of the ocean microbiome, providing insights into its vulnerability or resilience in the face of ongoing global change.
