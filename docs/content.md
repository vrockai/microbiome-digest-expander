Progression of chronic lung disease may lead to the requirement for lung transplant (LTx). Despite improvements in short-term survival after LTx, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains a critical challenge for long-term survival. This study investigates the molecular and microbial relationships between underlying lung disease and the development of CLAD in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from subjects post-LTx, which is crucial for tailoring treatment strategies specific to allograft dysfunctions.

## Abundance measurements reveal the balance between lysis and lysogeny in the human gut microbiome.
 10.10.2024, _J Lopez, S McKeithen-Mead, H Shi, TH Nguyen, KC Huang, BH Good_


The human gut contains diverse communities of bacteriophage, whose interactions with the broader microbiome and potential roles in human health are only beginning to be uncovered. Here, we combine multiple types of data to quantitatively estimate gut phage population dynamics and lifestyle characteristics in human subjects. Unifying results from previous studies, we show that an average human gut contains a low ratio of phage particles to bacterial cells (~1:100), but a much larger ratio of phage genomes to bacterial genomes (~4:1), implying that most gut phage are effectively temperate (e.g., integrated prophage, phage-plasmids, etc.). By integrating imaging and sequencing data with a generalized model of temperate phage dynamics, we estimate that phage induction and lysis occurs at a low average rate (~0.001-0.01 per bacterium per day), imposing only a modest fitness burden on their bacterial hosts. Consistent with these estimates, we find that the phage composition of a diverse synthetic community in gnotobiotic mice can be quantitatively predicted from bacterial abundances alone, while still exhibiting phage diversity comparable to native human microbiomes. These results provide a foundation for interpreting existing and future studies on links between the gut virome and human health.

Continuous cropping is a common cultivation practice in lavender cultivation, and the structure of the soil microbial community is one of the main reasons affecting the continuous cropping disorder in lavender; however, the relationship between the number of years of cultivation and inter-root microbial composition has not yet been investigated; using Illumina high-throughput sequencing we detected fungal community structure of rhizosphere soil under 1 (L1), 3 (L3), 5 (L5) and 0 (L0) years' of lavender cultivation in Yili, Xinjiang China. The results showed that with the extension of planting years, the physical-chemical characteristics of the soil shifted, and the diversity of the fungal communities shrank, the abundance and richness of species decreased and then increased, and the phylogenetic diversity increased, The structure of the soil fungal communities varied greatly. At phylum level, dominant fungal phyla were Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, etc. At genus level, dominant genera were Gibberella, Mortierella, etc, whose absolute abundance all increased with increasing planting years (P &lt; 0.05); redundancy analysis showed that thesoil physicochemical characteristics significantly correlated with dominant bacterial genera. The FUN Guild prediction showed that six groups of plant pathogens and plant saprotrophs changed significantly (P &lt; 0.05), the amount of harmful bacteria in the soil increased while the amount of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungui (AMF) decreased, leading to a continuous cropping obstacle of lavender. The findings of this study provida theoretical foundation for the management of continuous cropping and the prevention fungus-related diseases in lavender.
