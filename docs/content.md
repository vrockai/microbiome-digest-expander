## The gut microbiome in sickle cell disease: Characterization and potential implications.
 28.08.2021, _H Brim, J Taylor, M Abbas, K Vilmenay, M Daremipouran, S Varma, E Lee, B Pace, WL Song-Naba, K Gupta, S Nekhai, P O'Neil, H Ashktorab_


Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that leads to hemolytic anemia, pain, organ damage and early mortality. It is characterized by polymerized deoxygenated hemoglobin, rigid sickle red blood cells and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). Recurrent hypoxia-reperfusion injury in the gut of SCD patients could increase tissue injury, permeability, and bacterial translocation. In this context, the gut microbiome, a major player in health and disease, might have significant impact. This study sought to characterize the gut microbiome in SCD.

## Bacterial resistance to CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials.
 27.08.2021, _RV Uribe, C Rathmer, LJ Jahn, MMH Ellabaan, SS Li, MOA Sommer_


In the age of antibiotic resistance and precise microbiome engineering, CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials promise to have a substantial impact on the way we treat diseases in the future. However, the efficacy of these antimicrobials and their mechanisms of resistance remain to be elucidated. We systematically investigated how a target E. coli strain can escape killing by episomally-encoded CRISPR-Cas9 antimicrobials. Using Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) we studied the killing efficiency and resistance mutation rate towards CRISPR-Cas9 antimicrobials and elucidated the underlying genetic alterations. We find that killing efficiency is not correlated with the number of cutting sites or the type of target. While the number of targets did not significantly affect efficiency of killing, it did reduce the emergence of chromosomal mutations conferring resistance. The most frequent target of resistance mutations was the plasmid-encoded SpCas9 that was inactivated by bacterial genome rearrangements involving translocation of mobile genetic elements such as insertion elements. This resistance mechanism can be overcome by re-introduction of an intact copy of SpCas9. The work presented here provides a guide to design strategies that reduce resistance and improve the activity of CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials.

## Depression: A Gut "Microbiome" Feeling!
 27.08.2021, _A Naguy, S Pridmore, MY Abuzeid, SH Thiguti, B Alamiri_


Burgeoning body of evidence from neuroscience is pouring in highlighting a potential association between gut microbiota with the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. Manipulation of gut microbiota may be then useful to decode this role and to provide novel therapeutics for major depressive disorder (MDD), developing microbiota-related biomarkers to stratify patients at risk and to delineate more homogeneous biotypes of MDD.

## The potential prebiotic effect of 2-Butyloctanol on the human axillary microbiome.
 27.08.2021, _M Li, K Truong, S Pillai, T Boyd, A Fan_


The human axilla is colonized by a wide array of microorganisms that contribute to the generation of body odor. Traditional antiperspirant/deodorant products are used to reduce perspiration in the axillary region and to treat or prevent the growth of bacteria in this region, thereby reducing or eliminating body odor. However, they may also compromise the axillary microbiome balance. The personal care industry has been seeking new ingredients, such as prebiotics or probiotics, to maintain a healthy balance of the skin microbiome by inhibiting odor-causing bacteria while maintaining and promoting the growth of good bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the prebiotic effect of a skin care ingredient, 2-butyloctanol, on the human axillary microbiome.

## Fecal Bacteria as Non-Invasive Biomarkers for Colorectal Adenocarcinoma.
 28.08.2021, _B Yuan, B Ma, J Yu, Q Meng, T Du, H Li, Y Zhu, Z Sun, S Ma, C Song_


Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) ranks one of the five most lethal malignant tumors both in China and worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment of CRC could substantially increase the survival rate. Emerging evidence has revealed the importance of gut microbiome on CRC, thus fecal microbial community could be termed as a potential screen for non-invasive diagnosis. Importantly, few numbers of bacteria genus as non-invasive biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity causing less cost would be benefitted more in clinical compared with the whole microbial community analysis. Here we analyzed the gut microbiome between CRC patients and healthy people using 16s rRNA sequencing showing the divergence of microbial composition between case and control. Furthermore, ExtraTrees classifier was performed for the classification of CRC gut microbiome and heathy control, and 13 bacteria were screened as biomarkers for CRC. In addition, 13 biomarkers including 12 bacteria genera and FOBT showed an outstanding sensitivity and specificity for discrimination of CRC patients from healthy controls. This method could be used as a non-invasive method for CRC early diagnosis.

## Molecular genetics for probiotic engineering: dissecting lactic acid bacteria.
 27.08.2021, _R Suissa, R Oved, G Jankelowitz, S Turjeman, O Koren, I Kolodkin-Gal_


The composition of the gut microbiome is greatly influenced by nutrition and dietary alterations which can also induce large temporary microbial shifts. However, the molecular mechanisms that promote these changes remain to be determined. Species of the family Lactobacillaceae and Bacillus species are genetically manipulatable bacteria that are naturally found in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract and are often considered models of beneficial microbiota. Here, we identify specific conserved molecular pathways that play a key role in host colonization by beneficial members of the microbiota. In particular, we highlight three pathways important to the success of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the GI tract: glycolysis and fermentation, microbial communication via membrane vesicles, and condition-dependent antibiotic production. We elaborate on how the understanding of these circuits can lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to combat GI tract infections.

 26.08.2021, _EL Plummer, JA Danielewski, SM Garland, J Su, SE Jacobs, GL Murray_


Introduction. Probiotic supplementation of preterm infants may prevent serious morbidities associated with prematurity.Aim. To investigate the impact of probiotic supplementation on the gut microbiota and determine factors associated with detection of probiotic species in the infant gut.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Probiotic supplementation increases the long-term colonization of probiotic species in the gut of preterm infants.Methodology. Longitudinal stool samples were collected from a cohort of very preterm infants participating in a blinded randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of probiotic supplementation (containing Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis BB-02, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4) for prevention of late-onset sepsis. The presence of B. longum subsp. infantis, B. animalis subsp. lactis and S. thermophilus was determined for up to 23 months after supplementation ended using real-time PCR. Logistic regression was used to investigate the impact of probiotic supplementation on the presence of each species.Results. Detection of B. longum subsp. infantis [odds ratio (OR): 53.1; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 35.6-79.1; P &lt; 0.001], B. animalis subsp. lactis (OR: 89.1; 95 % CI: 59.0-134.5; P &lt; 0.001) and S. thermophilus (OR: 5.66; 95 % CI: 4.35-7.37; P &lt; 0.001) was increased during the supplementation period in infants receiving probiotic supplementation. Post-supplementation, probiotic-supplemented infants had increased detection of B. longum subsp. infantis (OR: 2.53; 95 % CI: 1.64-3.90; P &lt; 0.001) and B. animalis subsp. lactis (OR: 1.59; 95 % CI: 1.05-2.41; P=0.030). Commencing probiotic supplementation before 5 days from birth was associated with increased detection of the probiotic species over the study period (B. longum subsp. infantis, OR: 1.20; B. animalis subsp. lactis, OR: 1.28; S. thermophilus, OR: 1.45).Conclusion. Probiotic supplementation with B. longum subsp. infantis BB-02, B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and S. thermophilus TH-4 enhances the presence of probiotic species in the gut microbiota of very preterm infants during and after supplementation. Commencing probiotic supplementation shortly after birth may be important for improving the long-term colonization of probiotic species.

## Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) Fruit Polysaccharides Regulated IBD Mice Via Targeting Gut Microbiota: Association of JNK/ERK/NF-κB Signaling Pathways.
 25.08.2021, _MY Jin, XY Wu, MY Li, XT Li, RM Huang, YM Sun, ZL Xu_


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease characterized by intestinal inflammation with immune dysregulation and intestinal microecological imbalance. In a dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced IBD mouse model, noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) fruit polysaccharides (NFP) with homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I domain decreased the concentration of serum LPS, TNF-α, and IL-17 by 84, 42, and 65%, respectively. It was abolished when intestinal microbiota were depleted by antibiotics. Sequencing analysis of gut microbiota showed an attenuated disruption of the microbial composition in the DSS+NFP group. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed that NFP upregulated the content of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid by onefold but reduced isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid contents. NFP also inhibited JNK, ERK, and NF-κB phosphorylation of IBD mice. Taken together, the mechanism of NFP alleviating IBD is related to the intestinal microecological balance to inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways. This study provides a basis for NFP as a cheap intervention for the prevention and treatment of IBD patients.

## Benchmarking laboratory processes to characterise low-biomass respiratory microbiota.
 26.08.2021, _R Hasrat, J Kool, WAA de Steenhuijsen Piters, MLJN Chu, S Kuiling, JA Groot, EM van Logchem, S Fuentes, E Franz, D Bogaert, T Bosch_


The low biomass of respiratory samples makes it difficult to accurately characterise the microbial community composition. PCR conditions and contaminating microbial DNA can alter the biological profile. The objective of this study was to benchmark the currently available laboratory protocols to accurately analyse the microbial community of low biomass samples. To study the effect of PCR conditions on the microbial community profile, we amplified the 16S rRNA gene of respiratory samples using various bacterial loads and different number of PCR cycles. Libraries were purified by gel electrophoresis or AMPure XP and sequenced by V2 or V3 MiSeq reagent kits by Illumina sequencing. The positive control was diluted in different solvents. PCR conditions had no significant influence on the microbial community profile of low biomass samples. Purification methods and MiSeq reagent kits provided nearly similar microbiota profiles (paired Bray-Curtis dissimilarity median: 0.03 and 0.05, respectively). While profiles of positive controls were significantly influenced by the type of dilution solvent, the theoretical profile of the Zymo mock was most accurately analysed when the Zymo mock was diluted in elution buffer (difference compared to the theoretical Zymo mock: 21.6% for elution buffer, 29.2% for Milli-Q, and 79.6% for DNA/RNA shield). Microbiota profiles of DNA blanks formed a distinct cluster compared to low biomass samples, demonstrating that low biomass samples can accurately be distinguished from DNA blanks. In summary, to accurately characterise the microbial community composition we recommend 1. amplification of the obtained microbial DNA with 30 PCR cycles, 2. purifying amplicon pools by two consecutive AMPure XP steps and 3. sequence the pooled amplicons by V3 MiSeq reagent kit. The benchmarked standardized laboratory workflow presented here ensures comparability of results within and between low biomass microbiome studies.

## Simultaneous feature selection and outlier detection with optimality guarantees.
 26.08.2021, _L Insolia, A Kenney, F Chiaromonte, G Felici_


Biomedical research is increasingly data rich, with studies comprising ever growing numbers of features. The larger a study, the higher the likelihood that a substantial portion of the features may be redundant and/or contain contamination (outlying values). This poses serious challenges, which are exacerbated in cases where the sample sizes are relatively small. Effective and efficient approaches to perform sparse estimation in the presence of outliers are critical for these studies, and have received considerable attention in the last decade. We contribute to this area considering high-dimensional regressions contaminated by multiple mean-shift outliers affecting both the response and the design matrix. We develop a general framework and use mixed-integer programming to simultaneously perform feature selection and outlier detection with provably optimal guarantees. We prove theoretical properties for our approach, i.e., a necessary and sufficient condition for the robustly strong oracle property, where the number of features can increase exponentially with the sample size; the optimal estimation of parameters; and the breakdown point of the resulting estimates. Moreover, we provide computationally efficient procedures to tune integer constraints and warm-start the algorithm. We show the superior performance of our proposal compared to existing heuristic methods through simulations and use it to study the relationships between childhood obesity and the human microbiome.

## SMDI: An Index for Measuring Subgingival Microbial Dysbiosis.
 25.08.2021, _T Chen, PD Marsh, NN Al-Hebshi_


An intuitive, clinically relevant index of microbial dysbiosis as a summary statistic of subgingival microbiome profiles is needed. Here, we describe a subgingival microbial dysbiosis index (SMDI) based on machine learning analysis of published periodontitis/health 16S microbiome data. The raw sequencing data, split into training and test sets, were quality filtered, taxonomically assigned to the species level, and centered log-ratio transformed. The training data set was subject to random forest analysis to identify discriminating species (DS) between periodontitis and health. DS lists, compiled by various "Gini" importance score cutoffs, were used to compute the SMDI for samples in the training and test data sets as the mean centered log-ratio abundance of periodontitis-associated species subtracted by that of health-associated ones. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed with receiver operating characteristic analysis. An SMDI based on 49 DS provided the highest accuracy with areas under the curve of 0.96 and 0.92 in the training and test data sets, respectively, and ranged from -6 (most normobiotic) to 5 (most dysbiotic) with a value around zero discriminating most of the periodontitis and healthy samples. The top periodontitis-associated DS were Treponema denticola, Mogibacterium timidum, Fretibacterium spp., and Tannerella forsythia, while Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus sanguinis were the top health-associated DS. The index was highly reproducible by hypervariable region. Applying the index to additional test data sets in which nitrate had been used to modulate the microbiome demonstrated that nitrate has dysbiosis-lowering properties in vitro and in vivo. Finally, 3 genera (Treponema, Fretibacterium, and Actinomyces) were identified that could be used for calculation of a simplified SMDI with comparable accuracy. In conclusion, we have developed a nonbiased, reproducible, and easy-to-interpret index that can be used to identify patients/sites at risk of periodontitis, to assess the microbial response to treatment, and, importantly, as a quantitative tool in microbiome modulation studies.
