## Babies, Bugs, and Barriers: Dietary Modulation of Intestinal Barrier Function in Early Life.
 13.06.2022, _JM Wells, Y Gao, N de Groot, MM Vonk, L Ulfman, RJJ van Neerven_


The intestinal barrier is essential in early life to prevent infection, inflammation, and food allergies. It consists of microbiota, a mucus layer, an epithelial layer, and the immune system. Microbial metabolites, the mucus, antimicrobial peptides, and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) protect the intestinal mucosa against infection. The complex interplay between these functionalities of the intestinal barrier is crucial in early life by supporting homeostasis, development of the intestinal immune system, and long-term gut health. Exclusive breastfeeding is highly recommended during the first 6 months. When breastfeeding is not possible, milk-based infant formulas are the only safe alternative. Breast milk contains many bioactive components that help to establish the intestinal microbiota and influence the development of the intestinal epithelium and the immune system. Importantly, breastfeeding lowers the risk for intestinal and respiratory tract infections. Here we review all aspects of intestinal barrier function and the nutritional components that impact its functionality in early life, such as micronutrients, bioactive milk proteins, milk lipids, and human milk oligosaccharides. These components are present in breast milk and can be added to milk-based infant formulas to support gut health and immunity. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Nutrition, Volume 42 is August 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

Due to the increasing ageing population, neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) have been a global public health issue, and its prevention and early diagnosis are crucial. Our previous study demonstrated that there is a significant correlation between specific populations and NCDs, but the biological characteristics of the vulnerable group predispose to NCDs are unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the predictors for the vulnerable group by a multi-omics analysis.

## Altered skin fungal and bacterial community compositions in tinea capitis.
 11.06.2022, _T Rong, P Zhu, Y Zhou, Q Li, Z Wan, R Li, W Ruojun_


Tinea capitis is an infection of the scalp and hair shaft caused by dermatophytes that predominantly occurs in children. Skin fungal infections have been found to be associated with alterations in the overall bacterial and fungal communities. However, the scalp microbiome in tinea capitis have not been fully investigated.

## Effects of short chain fructo-oligosaccharides on selected skin bacteria.

The human skin microbiota plays a key role in the maintenance of healthy skin, ensuring protection and biological barrier by competing with pathogens and by closely communicating with the immune system. The development of approaches which preserve or restore the skin microbiota represents a novel target for skincare applications. Prebiotics could be applied to balance almost any microbial community to achieve advantageous effects. However, information about their effectiveness as skin microbiota modulators is limited. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of short chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) from sugar beet (DP 3-5), well-recognised prebiotics, on some representative bacterial strains of the skin microbiota. We measured the growth and competitive activity of these specific bacteria for the use of scFOS as energy source in minimal medium and in a reconstructed human epithelium (RHE) in vitro model. In minimal growth medium, scFOS promoted and sustained the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis up to 24 h, considered a beneficial skin commensal bacterium, while inhibiting both Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus growth, regarded as opportunistic pathogens. S. epidermidis showed the highest colonization potential and 1% scFOS was effective in shifting the competition in favour of S. epidermidis with respect to C. acnes in the RHE model. This latter effect was observed following 24 h of exposure, suggesting a long-term effect of scFOS in a highly skin dynamic environment. Therefore, scFOS could be effectively implemented in skincare formulations for recovering skin microbiota homeostasis.
