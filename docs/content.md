Exercise exerts a wide range of beneficial effects for healthy physiology1. However, the mechanisms regulating an individual's motivation to engage in physical activity remain incompletely understood. An important factor stimulating the engagement in both competitive and recreational exercise is the motivating pleasure derived from prolonged physical activity, which is triggered by exercise-induced neurochemical changes in the brain. Here, we report on the discovery of a gut-brain connection in mice that enhances exercise performance by augmenting dopamine signalling during physical activity. We find that microbiome-dependent production of endocannabinoid metabolites in the gut stimulates the activity of TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons and thereby elevates dopamine levels in the ventral striatum during exercise. Stimulation of this pathway improves running performance, whereas microbiome depletion, peripheral endocannabinoid receptor inhibition, ablation of spinal afferent neurons or dopamine blockade abrogate exercise capacity. These findings indicate that the rewarding properties of exercise are influenced by gut-derived interoceptive circuits and provide a microbiome-dependent explanation for interindividual variability in exercise performance. Our study also suggests that interoceptomimetic molecules that stimulate the transmission of gut-derived signals to the brain may enhance the motivation for exercise.

Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota plays a predominant role in Crohn's disease (CD). However, the microbiome alterations in the early stage of CD patients still remain unclear. The present study aimed to identify dysbacteriosis in patients with early CD and explore specific gut bacteria related to the progression of CD.

The gut and liver are connected via the portal vein, and this relationship, which includes the gut microbiome, is described as the gut-liver axis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can infect the liver and cause fibrosis with chronic infection. HCV has been associated with an altered gut microbiome; however, how these changes impact metabolism across the gut-liver axis and how this varies with disease severity and time is unclear. Here we used multi-omics analysis of portal and peripheral blood, faeces and liver tissue to characterize the gut-liver axis of patients with HCV across a fibrosis severity gradient before (n = 29) and 6 months after (n = 23) sustained virologic response, that is, no detection of the virus. Fatty acids were the major metabolites perturbed across the liver, portal vein and gut microbiome in HCV, especially in patients with cirrhosis. Decreased fatty acid degradation by hepatic peroxisomes and mitochondria was coupled with increased free fatty acid (FFA) influx to the liver via the portal vein. Metatranscriptomics indicated that Anaerostipes hadrus-mediated fatty acid synthesis influences portal FFAs. Both microbial fatty acid synthesis and portal FFAs were associated with enhanced hepatic fibrosis. Bacteroides vulgatus-mediated intestinal glycan breakdown was linked to portal glycan products, which in turn correlated with enhanced portal inflammation in HCV. Paired comparison of patient samples at both timepoints showed that hepatic metabolism, especially in peroxisomes, is persistently dysregulated in cirrhosis independently of the virus. Sustained virologic response was associated with a potential beneficial role for Methanobrevibacter smithii, which correlated with liver disease severity markers. These results develop our understanding of the gut-liver axis in HCV and non-HCV liver disease aetiologies and provide a foundation for future therapies.

## Impact of HIV infection and integrase strand transfer inhibitors-based treatment on the gut virome.
 15.12.2022, _P Villoslada-Blanco, P Pérez-Matute, M Íñiguez, E Recio-Fernández, D Jansen, L De Coninck, L Close, P Blanco-Navarrete, L Metola, V Ibarra, J Alba, J Matthijnssens, JA Oteo_


Viruses are the most abundant components of the human gut microbiome with a significant impact on health and disease. The effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on gut virome has been scarcely analysed. Several studies suggested that integrase strand transfers inhibitors (INSTIs) are associated with a healthier gut. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of HIV infection and INSTIs on gut virome composition. 26 non-HIV-infected volunteers, 15 naive HIV-infected patients and 15 INSTIs-treated HIV-infected patients were recruited and their gut virome composition was analysed using shotgun sequencing. Bacteriophages were the most abundant and diverse viruses present in gut. HIV infection was accompanied by a decrease in phage richness which was reverted after INSTIs-based treatment. β-diversity of phages revealed that samples from HIV-infected patients clustered separately from those belonging to the control group. Differential abundant analysis showed an increase in phages belonging to Caudoviricetes class in the naive group and a decrease of Malgrandaviricetes class phages in the INSTIs-treated group compared to the control group. Besides, it was observed that INSTIs-based treatment was not able to reverse the increase of lysogenic phages associated with HIV infection or to modify the decrease observed on the relative abundance of Proteobacteria-infecting phages. Our study describes for the first time the impact of HIV and INSTIs on gut virome and demonstrates that INSTIs-based treatments are able to partially restore gut dysbiosis at the viral level, which opens several opportunities for new studies focused on microbiota-based therapies.

## Consequences of collagen induced inflammatory arthritis on circadian regulation of the gut microbiome.
 16.12.2022, _DA Simpkins, P Downton, KJ Gray, SH Dickson, RJ Maidstone, JE Konkel, MR Hepworth, DW Ray, DA Bechtold, JE Gibbs_


The gut microbiota is important for host health and immune system function. Moreover autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are associated with significant gut microbiota dysbiosis, although the causes and consequences of this are not fully understood. It has become clear that the composition and metabolic outputs of the microbiome exhibit robust 24 h oscillations, a result of daily variation in timing of food intake as well as rhythmic circadian clock function in the gut. Here, we report that experimental inflammatory arthritis leads to a re-organization of circadian rhythmicity in both the gut and associated microbiome. Mice with collagen induced arthritis exhibited extensive changes in rhythmic gene expression in the colon, and reduced barrier integrity. Re-modeling of the host gut circadian transcriptome was accompanied by significant alteration of the microbiota, including widespread loss of rhythmicity in symbiont species of Lactobacillus, and alteration in circulating microbial derived factors, such as tryptophan metabolites, which are associated with maintenance of barrier function and immune cell populations within the gut. These findings highlight that altered circadian rhythmicity during inflammatory disease contributes to dysregulation of gut integrity and microbiome function.

## HIV-Positive Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy Have an Altered Mucosal Intestinal but Not Oral Microbiome.
 13.12.2022, _J Meng, J Tao, Y Abu, DA Sussman, M Girotra, D Franceschi, S Roy_


This study characterized compositional and functional shifts in the intestinal and oral microbiome in HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy compared to HIV-negative individuals. Seventy-nine specimens were collected from 5 HIV-positive and 12 control subjects from five locations (colon brush, colon wash, terminal ileum [TI] brush, TI wash, and saliva) during colonoscopy and at patient visits. Microbiome composition was characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing, and microbiome function was predicted using bioinformatics tools (PICRUSt and BugBase). Our analysis indicated that the β-diversity of all intestinal samples (colon brush, colon wash, TI brush, and TI wash) from patients with HIV was significantly different from patients without HIV. Specifically, bacteria from genera Prevotella, Fusobacterium, and Megasphaera were more abundant in samples from HIV-positive patients. On the other hand, bacteria from genera Ruminococcus, Blautia, and Clostridium were more abundant in samples from HIV-negative patients. Additionally, HIV-positive patients had higher abundances of biofilm-forming and pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, pathways related to translation and nucleotide metabolism were elevated in HIV-positive patients, whereas pathways related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were positively correlated with samples from HIV-negative patients. Our analyses further showed variations in microbiome composition in HIV-positive and negative patients by sampling site. Samples from colon wash, colon brush, and TI wash were significant between groups, while samples from TI brush and saliva were not significant. Taken together, here, we report altered intestinal microbiome composition and predicted function in patients with HIV compared to uninfected patients, though we found no changes in the oral microbiome. IMPORTANCE Over 37 million people worldwide are living with HIV. Although the availability of antiretroviral therapy has significantly reduced the number of AIDS-related deaths, individuals living with HIV are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. We now know that HIV interacts with the trillions of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the human body termed the microbiome. Only a limited number of previous studies have compared variations in the oral and gastrointestinal microbiome with HIV infection. Here, we detail how the oral and gastrointestinal microbiome changes with HIV infection, having used 5 different sampling sites to gain a more comprehensive view of these changes by location. Our results show site-specific changes in the intestinal microbiome associated with HIV infection. Additionally, we show that while there were significant changes in the intestinal microbiome, there were no significant changes in the oral microbiome.

## Intratumoral microbiome and gastrointestinal cancers.
 16.12.2022, _S Li, Q Li, W Lu_


Emerging studies have revealed the role of microbiota in regulating tumorigenesis, development, and response to antitumor treatment. However, most studies have focused on gut microbiota, and little is known about the intratumoral microbiome. To date, the latest research has indicated that the intratumoral microbiome is a key component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and can promote a heterogeneous immune microenvironment, reprogram tumor metabolism to affect tumor invasion and metastasis. In this review, we will summarize existing studies on the intratumoral microbiome of gastrointestinal cancers and reveal their crosstalk. This will provide a better understanding of this emerging field and help to explore new therapeutic approaches for cancer patients by targeting the intratumoral microbiome.

## Increased Proportion of Fiber-Degrading Microbes and Enhanced Cecum Development Jointly Promote Host To Digest Appropriate High-Fiber Diets.
 13.12.2022, _G Pu, L Hou, T Du, W Zhou, C Liu, P Niu, C Wu, W Bao, R Huang, P Li_


Previous study found that appropriate high-fiber diet (containing 19.10% total dietary fiber [TDF], treatment II) did not reduce apparent fiber digestibility of Chinese Suhuai finishing pigs and increased the yield of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), but too high-fiber diet (containing 24.11% TDF, treatment IV) significantly reduced apparent fiber digestibility compared with normal diet (containing 16.70% TDF, control group). However, characteristics of microbiota at the species level and histological structure in pigs with the ability to digest appropriate high-fiber diets were still unknown. This study conducted comparative analysis of cecal physiology and microbial populations colonizing cecal mucosa. The results showed intestinal development indexes including cecum length, densities of cecal goblet cells, and renewal of cecal epithelial cells in treatment II and IV had better performance than those in the control. Paludibacter jiangxiensis, Coprobacter fastidiosus, Bacteroides coprocola CAG:162, Bacteroides barnesiae, and Parabacteroides merdae enriched in treatment II expressed large number of glycoside hydrolase (GH)-encoding genes and had the largest number of GH families. In addition, pathogenic bacteria (Shigella sonnei, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Helicobacter felis) were enriched in treatment IV. Correlation analysis revealed that the intestinal development index positively correlated with the relative abundance of cecal mucosal microbiota and the amount of digested fiber. These results indicated that increased proportions of fiber-degrading microbes and enhanced intestinal development jointly promote the host to digest an appropriate high-fiber diet. However, although too-high fiber levels in diet could maintain the adaptive development of cecal epithelium, the proportions of pathogenic bacteria increased, which might lead to a decrease of fiber digestion in pigs. IMPORTANCE Although studies about the effects of dietary fiber on fiber digestion and intestinal microbiota of pigs were widely in progress, few studies have been conducted on the dynamic response of intestinal microbiota to dietary fiber levels, and the characteristics of intestinal microbiota and intestinal epithelial development adapted to high-fiber diet s were still unclear. Appropriate high fiber promoted the thickness of large intestine wall, increased the density of cecal goblet cells, and promoted the renewal of cecal epithelial cells. In addition, appropriate high fiber improves the microbial abundance with fiber-digesting potential. However, excessive dietary fiber caused an increase in the abundance of pathogenic bacteria. These results indicated that an increased proportion of fiber-degrading microbes and enhanced intestinal development jointly promote host to digest appropriate high-fiber diets. However, although too-high fiber levels in diet could maintain the adaptive development of cecal epithelium, the proportions of pathogenic bacteria increased, which might lead to a decrease of fiber digestion in pigs. Our data provided a theoretical basis for rational and efficient utilization of unconventional feed resources in pig production.
