## An evolving view on biogeochemical cycling of iron.
 19.05.2021, _A Kappler, C Bryce, M Mansor, U Lueder, JM Byrne, ED Swanner_


Biogeochemical cycling of iron is crucial to many environmental processes, such as ocean productivity, carbon storage, greenhouse gas emissions and the fate of nutrients, toxic metals and metalloids. Knowledge of the underlying processes involved in iron cycling has accelerated in recent years along with appreciation of the complex network of biotic and abiotic reactions dictating the speciation, mobility and reactivity of iron in the environment. Recent studies have provided insights into novel processes in the biogeochemical iron cycle such as microbial ammonium oxidation and methane oxidation coupled to Fe(III) reduction. They have also revealed that processes in the biogeochemical iron cycle spatially overlap and may compete with each other, and that oxidation and reduction of iron occur cyclically or simultaneously in many environments. This Review discusses these advances with particular focus on their environmental consequences, including the formation of greenhouse gases and the fate of nutrients and contaminants.

## Beyond horizontal gene transfer: the role of plasmids in bacterial evolution.
 19.05.2021, _J Rodríguez-Beltrán, J DelaFuente, R León-Sampedro, RC MacLean, Á San Millán_


Plasmids have a key role in bacterial ecology and evolution because they mobilize accessory genes by horizontal gene transfer. However, recent studies have revealed that the evolutionary impact of plasmids goes above and beyond their being mere gene delivery platforms. Plasmids are usually kept at multiple copies per cell, producing islands of polyploidy in the bacterial genome. As a consequence, the evolution of plasmid-encoded genes is governed by a set of rules different from those affecting chromosomal genes, and these rules are shaped by unusual concepts in bacterial genetics, such as genetic dominance, heteroplasmy or segregational drift. In this Review, we discuss recent advances that underscore the importance of plasmids in bacterial ecology and evolution beyond horizontal gene transfer. We focus on new evidence that suggests that plasmids might accelerate bacterial evolution, mainly by promoting the evolution of plasmid-encoded genes, but also by enhancing the adaptation of their host chromosome. Finally, we integrate the most relevant theoretical and empirical studies providing a global understanding of the forces that govern plasmid-mediated evolution in bacteria.

## Cells within cells: Rickettsiales and the obligate intracellular bacterial lifestyle.
 19.05.2021, _J Salje_


The Rickettsiales are a group of obligate intracellular vector-borne Gram-negative bacteria that include many organisms of clinical and agricultural importance, including Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Wolbachia, Rickettsia spp. and Orientia tsutsugamushi. This Review provides an overview of the current state of knowledge of the biology of these bacteria and their interactions with host cells, with a focus on pathogenic species or those that are otherwise important for human health. This includes a description of rickettsial genomics, bacterial cell biology, the intracellular lifestyles of Rickettsiales and the mechanisms by which they induce and evade the innate immune response.

## Microbial volatile organic compounds in intra-kingdom and inter-kingdom interactions.
 19.05.2021, _L Weisskopf, S Schulz, P Garbeva_


Microorganisms produce and excrete a versatile array of metabolites with different physico-chemical properties and biological activities. However, the ability of microorganisms to release volatile compounds has only attracted research attention in the past decade. Recent research has revealed that microbial volatiles are chemically very diverse and have important roles in distant interactions and communication. Microbial volatiles can diffuse fast in both gas and water phases, and thus can mediate swift chemical interactions. As well as constitutively emitted volatiles, microorganisms can emit induced volatiles that are triggered by biological interactions or environmental cues. In this Review, we highlight recent discoveries concerning microbial volatile compounds and their roles in intra-kingdom microbial interactions and inter-kingdom interactions with plants and insects. Furthermore, we indicate the potential biotechnological applications of microbial volatiles and discuss challenges and perspectives in this emerging research field.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition associated with high transepidermal water loss, high skin pH, and Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization. The treatment of AD with bath additives remains highly debated. Recent evidence suggests that dilute apple cider vinegar (ACV) may improve skin barrier integrity in AD, but its safety and efficacy are not well studied. This pilot split-arm study analyzed the effect of dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on skin barrier integrity in patients with atopic dermatitis as measured by skin transepidermal water loss and skin pH.

## Metabolomic profiling identifies complex lipid species and amino acid analogues associated with response to weight loss interventions.
 27.05.2021, _NA Bihlmeyer, LC Kwee, CB Clish, AA Deik, RE Gerszten, NJ Pagidipati, B Laferrère, LP Svetkey, CB Newgard, WE Kraus, SH Shah_


Obesity is an epidemic internationally. While weight loss interventions are efficacious, they are compounded by heterogeneity with regards to clinically relevant metabolic responses. Thus, we sought to identify metabolic biomarkers that are associated with beneficial metabolic changes to weight loss and which distinguish individuals with obesity who would most benefit from a given type of intervention. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based profiling was used to measure 765 metabolites in baseline plasma from three different weight loss studies: WLM (behavioral intervention, N = 443), STRRIDE-PD (exercise intervention, N = 163), and CBD (surgical cohort, N = 125). The primary outcome was percent change in insulin resistance (as measured by the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance [%ΔHOMA-IR]) over the intervention. Overall, 92 individual metabolites were associated with %ΔHOMA-IR after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Concordantly, the most significant metabolites were triacylglycerols (TAGs; p = 2.3e-5) and diacylglycerols (DAGs; p = 1.6e-4), with higher baseline TAG and DAG levels associated with a greater improvement in insulin resistance with weight loss. In tests of heterogeneity, 50 metabolites changed differently between weight loss interventions; we found amino acids, peptides, and their analogues to be most significant (4.7e-3) in this category. Our results highlight novel metabolic pathways associated with heterogeneity in response to weight loss interventions, and related biomarkers which could be used in future studies of personalized approaches to weight loss interventions.

## Gut microbiome differences among Mexican Americans with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
 26.05.2021, _AK Kitten, L Ryan, GC Lee, BE Flores, KR Reveles_


Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an urgent public health problem and disproportionately affects Mexican Americans. The gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes; however, no studies have examined this association in Mexican-Americans. The objective of this study was to compare gut microbiome composition between Mexican-Americans with and without T2DM.

In gut microbiome studies, the cultured gut microbial resource plays essential roles, such as helping to unravel gut microbial functions and host-microbe interactions. Although several major studies have been performed to elucidate the cultured human gut microbiota, up to 70% of the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome species have not been cultured to date. Large-scale gut microbial isolation and identification as well as availability to the public are imperative for gut microbial studies and further characterizing human gut microbial functions.

## Gut microbiota profiles of young South Indian children: Child sex-specific relations with growth.
 26.05.2021, _N Shivakumar, A Sivadas, S Devi, F Jahoor, J McLaughlin, CP Smith, AV Kurpad, A Mukhopadhyay_


Gut microbiota has been implicated as a modifier of childhood growth. Here, 16S rRNA sequencing-based fecal microbiota profiles of 18-24 month old Indian children were evaluated (n = 41), in relation to their anthropometric parameters, intestinal permeability, body composition and total energy expenditure. Pathway analyses were conducted to assess microbial functions related to stunting, underweight and wasting. The fecal microbiota was enriched in Prevotella 9, Bifidobacterium and Escherichia-Shigella. Weight, weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ) and weight-for-length Z-scores (WLZ), along with age, acted as covariates of microbiota variation specifically in boys (n = 23). Bifidobacterium longum subsp longum abundance was positively associated with WAZ while Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium breve abundances were negatively associated with age. The lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway was upregulated in stunted (n = 16) and wasted (n = 8) children. Findings from this study indicate that child sex may be a critical modifier of the role of gut microbiota on childhood growth.

## Soybean meal and poultry offal meal effects on digestibility of adult dogs diets: Systematic review.
 27.05.2021, _K Vanelli, ACF de Oliveira, CS Sotomaior, SH Weber, LB Costa_


Soybean meal and poultry offal meal are protein ingredients commonly used in the formulation of commercial diets for dogs. However, there remains great variability in the data on the digestibility of each protein source. This systematic review study aimed to examine the intake, apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients and fecal output of protein sources (soybean meal and poultry offal meal) in adult dog food as reported in published studies. The article search was conducted in August 2018 in the PUBMED, SciELO, Science Direct and AGRIS indexing databases. The literature search was performed using "digestibility", "source protein" and "dog" as the main key terms combined with sub-terms to broaden the scope of the search. Criteria were defined for readability, exclusion and inclusion of articles. Results were organized in groups according to the search in the indexing databases, totaling 1,414 articles. After the works were selected following the inclusion criteria, 17 articles were evaluated in this review. According to most studies, plant-based ingredients have a less variable nutritional composition than animal-derived ingredients and poultry offal meal increases the digestibility coefficients of nutrients and energy and reduces fecal dry matter production. Factors inherent to raw-material origin, ingredient and food processing, as well as the high heterogeneity of the methodologies evaluated in the studies are directly related to the obtained results. To ensure a more accurate evaluation of the quality and of effects on the digestibility of protein sources, we recommended that articles include ingredient processing data and that the variables be evaluated under standardized study conditions.

## A survey of mosquito-borne and insect-specific viruses in hospitals and livestock markets in western Kenya.
 31.05.2021, _T Chiuya, DK Masiga, LC Falzon, ADS Bastos, EM Fèvre, J Villinger_


Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes are prolific vectors of arboviruses that are a global threat to human and animal health. Increased globalization and ease of travel have facilitated the worldwide dissemination of these mosquitoes and the viruses they transmit. To assess disease risk, we determined the frequency of arboviruses in western Kenyan counties bordering an area of high arboviral activity. In addition to pathogenic viruses, insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs), some of which are thought to impair the transmission of specific pathogenic arboviruses, were also evaluated. We trapped mosquitoes in the short and long rainy seasons in 2018 and 2019 at livestock markets and hospitals. Mosquitoes were screened for dengue, chikungunya and other human pathogenic arboviruses, ISFs, and their blood-meal sources as determined by high-resolution melting analysis of (RT-)PCR products. Of 6,848 mosquitoes collected, 89% were trapped during the long rainy season, with A. aegypti (59%) and Cx. pipiens sensu lato (40%) being the most abundant. Most blood-fed mosquitoes were Cx. pipiens s.l. with blood-meals from humans, chicken, and sparrow (Passer sp.). We did not detect dengue or chikungunya viruses. However, one Culex poicilipes female was positive for Sindbis virus, 30 pools of Ae. aegypti had cell fusing agent virus (CFAV; infection rate (IR) = 1.27%, 95% CI = 0.87%-1.78%); 11 pools of Ae. aegypti had Aedes flavivirus (AeFV; IR = 0.43%, 95% CI = 0.23%-0.74%); and seven pools of Cx. pipiens s.l. (IR = 0.23%, 95% CI = 0.1%-0.45%) and one pool of Culex annulioris had Culex flavivirus. Sindbis virus, which causes febrile illness in humans, can complicate the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with fever. The presence of Sindbis virus in a single mosquito from a population of mosquitoes with ISFs calls for further investigation into the role ISFs may play in blocking transmission of other arboviruses in this region.

## Microbiomes of clownfish and their symbiotic host anemone converge before their first physical contact.
 21.05.2021, _AG Émie, S François-Étienne, B Sidki, D Nicolas_


_Animals, Flavobacteriaceae, Microbiota, Perciformes, Sea Anemones, Symbiosis_
One of the most charismatic, and yet not completely resolved example of mutualistic interaction is the partnership of clownfish and its symbiotic sea anemone. The mechanism explaining this tolerance currently relies on the molecular mimicry of clownfish epithelial mucus, which could serve as camouflage, preventing the anemone's nematocysts' discharge. Resident bacteria are known as key drivers of epithelial mucus chemical signature in vertebrates. A recent study has proposed a restructuration of the skin microbiota in a generalist clown fish when first contacting its symbiotic anemone. We explored a novel hypothesis by testing the effect of remote interaction on epithelial microbiota restructuration in both partners.

## Influence of seasonal changes and salinity on spinach phyllosphere bacterial functional assemblage.
 01.06.2021, _AM Ibekwe, S Ors, JFS Ferreira, X Liu, DL Suarez_


The phyllosphere is the aerial part of plants that is exposed to different environmental conditions and is also known to harbor a wide variety of bacteria including both plant and human pathogens. However, studies on phyllosphere bacterial communities have focused on bacterial composition at different stages of plant growth without correlating their functional capabilities to bacterial communities. In this study, we examined the seasonal effects and temporal variabilities driving bacterial community composition and function in spinach phyllosphere due to increasing salinity and season and estimated the functional capacity of bacterial community16S V4 rRNA gene profiles by indirectly inferring the abundance of functional genes based on metagenomics inference tool Piphillin. The experimental design involved three sets of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L., cv. Racoon) grown with saline water during different seasons. Total bacteria DNA from leaf surfaces were sequenced using MiSeq® Illumina platform. About 66.35% of bacteria detected in the phyllosphere were dominated by four phyla- Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) showed that phyllosphere microbiomes were significantly (P &lt; 0.003) affected by season, but not salinity (P = 0.501). The most abundant inferred functional pathways in leaf samples were the amino acids biosynthesis, ABC transporters, ribosome, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, two-component system, carbon metabolism, purine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism. The photosynthesis antenna proteins pathway was significantly enriched in June leaf samples, when compared to March and May. Several genes related to toxin co-regulated pilus biosynthesis proteins were also significantly enriched in June leaf samples, when compared to March and May leaf samples. Therefore, planting and harvesting times must be considered during leafy green production due to the influence of seasons in growth and proliferation of phyllosphere microbial communities.

## Comparison of bacterial and archaeal communities in two fertilizer doses and soil compartments under continuous cultivation system of garlic.
 25.05.2021, _J Zhou, Y Kong, W Zhao, G Wei, Q Wang, L Ma, T Wang, F Shu, W Sha_


Soil microbial communities are affected by interactions between agricultural management (e.g., fertilizer) and soil compartment, but few studies have considered combinations of these factors. We compared the microbial abundance, diversity and community structure in two fertilizer dose (high vs. low NPK) and soil compartment (rhizosphere vs. bulk soils) under 6-year fertilization regimes in a continuous garlic cropping system in China. The soil contents of NO3- and available K were significantly higher in bulk soil in the high-NPK. The 16S rRNA gene-based bacterial and archaeal abundances were positively affected by both the fertilizer dose and soil compartment, and were higher in the high-NPK fertilization and rhizosphere samples. High-NPK fertilization increased the Shannon index and decreased bacterial and archaeal richness, whereas the evenness was marginally positively affected by both the fertilizer dose and soil compartment. Soil compartment exerted a greater effect on the bacterial and archaeal community structure than did the fertilization dose, as demonstrated by both the nonmetric multidimensional scaling and redundancy analysis results. We found that rhizosphere effects significantly distinguished 12 dominant classes of bacterial and archaeal communities, whereas the fertilizer dose significantly identified four dominant classes. In particular, a Linear Effect Size analysis showed that some taxa, including Alphaproteobacteria, Rhizobiales, Xanthomonadaceae and Flavobacterium, were enriched in the garlic rhizosphere of the high-NPK fertilizer samples. Overall, the fertilizer dose interacted with soil compartment to shape the bacterial and archaeal community composition, abundance, and biodiversity in the garlic rhizosphere. These results provide an important basis for further understanding adaptive garlic-microbe feedback, reframing roots as a significant moderating influence in agricultural management and shaping the microbial community.

_Ecosystem, Humans, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Seasons, Sewage, Waste Water_
Microorganisms in urban sanitary sewers exhibit community properties that suggest sewers are a novel ecosystem. Sewer microorganisms present both an opportunity as a control point for wastewater treatment and a risk to human health. If treatment processes are to be improved and health risks quantified, then it is necessary to understand microbial distributions and dynamics within this community. Here, we use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize raw influent wastewater bacterial communities in a 5-year time series from two wastewater treatment plants in Milwaukee, WI; influent wastewater from 77 treatment plants across the USA; and wastewater in 12 Milwaukee residential sewers.

Total DNA (intracellular, iDNA and extracellular, eDNA) from ancient permafrost records the mixed genetic repository of the past and present microbial populations through geological time. Given the exceptional preservation of eDNA under perennial frozen conditions, typical metagenomic sequencing of total DNA precludes the discrimination between fossil and living microorganisms in ancient cryogenic environments. DNA repair protocols were combined with high throughput sequencing (HTS) of separate iDNA and eDNA fraction to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from ancient microbial DNA entrapped in Siberian coastal permafrost.

Beginning in the last century, coral reefs have suffered the consequences of anthropogenic activities, including oil contamination. Chemical remediation methods, such as dispersants, can cause substantial harm to corals and reduce their resilience to stressors. To evaluate the impacts of oil contamination and find potential alternative solutions to chemical dispersants, we conducted a mesocosm experiment with the fire coral Millepora alcicornis, which is sensitive to environmental changes. We exposed M. alcicornis to a realistic oil-spill scenario in which we applied an innovative multi-domain bioremediator consortium (bacteria, filamentous fungi, and yeast) and a chemical dispersant (Corexit® 9500, one of the most widely used dispersants), to assess the effects on host health and host-associated microbial communities.
