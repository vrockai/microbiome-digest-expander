The gut and oral microbiome is altered in people living with HIV (PLWH). While antiretroviral treatment (ART) is pivotal in restoring immune function in PLWH, several studies have identified an association between specific antiretrovirals, particularly integrase inhibitors (INSTI), and weight gain. In our study, we explored the differences in the oral and gut microbiota of PLWH under different ART regimens, and its correlation to Body Mass Index (BMI). Fecal and salivary samples were collected from PLWH (n = 69) and healthy controls (HC, n = 80). We performed taxonomy analysis to determine the microbial composition and relationship between microbial abundance and ART regimens, BMI, CD4+T-cell count, CD4/CD8 ratio, and ART duration. PLWH showed significantly lower richness compared to HC in both the oral and gut environment. The gut microbiome composition of INSTI-treated individuals was enriched with Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium, whereas non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-treated individuals were enriched with Gordonibacter, Megasphaera, and Staphylococcus. In the oral microenvironment, Veillonella was significantly more abundant in INSTI-treated individuals and Fusobacterium and Alloprevotella in the NNRTI-treated individuals. Furthermore, Bifidobacterium and Dorea were enriched in gut milieu of PLWH with high BMI. Collectively, our findings identify distinct microbial profiles, which are associated with different ART regimens and BMI in PLWH on successful ART, thereby highlighting significant effects of specific antiretrovirals on the microbiome.

## Gut Microbiota and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Neuroinflammatory Mediated Mechanism of Pathogenesis?
 02.08.2024, _F Zarimeidani, R Rahmati, M Mostafavi, M Darvishi, S Khodadadi, M Mohammadi, F Shamlou, S Bakhtiyari, I Alipourfard_


Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social communication and behavior, frequently accompanied by restricted and repetitive patterns of interests or activities. The gut microbiota has been implicated in the etiology of ASD due to its impact on the bidirectional communication pathway known as the gut-brain axis. However, the precise involvement of the gut microbiota in the causation of ASD is unclear. This study critically examines recent evidence to rationalize a probable mechanism in which gut microbiota symbiosis can induce neuroinflammation through intermediator cytokines and metabolites. To develop ASD, loss of the integrity of the intestinal barrier, activation of microglia, and dysregulation of neurotransmitters are caused by neural inflammatory factors. It has emphasized the potential role of neuroinflammatory intermediates linked to gut microbiota alterations in individuals with ASD. Specifically, cytokines like brain-derived neurotrophic factor, calprotectin, eotaxin, and some metabolites and microRNAs have been considered etiological biomarkers. We have also overviewed how probiotic trials may be used as a therapeutic strategy in ASD to reestablish a healthy balance in the gut microbiota. Evidence indicates neuroinflammation induced by dysregulated gut microbiota in ASD, yet there is little clarity based on analysis of the circulating immune profile. It deems the repair of microbiota load would lower inflammatory chaos in the GI tract, correct neuroinflammatory mediators, and modulate the neurotransmitters to attenuate autism. The interaction between the gut and the brain, along with alterations in microbiota and neuroinflammatory biomarkers, serves as a foundational background for understanding the etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder.

## Gut microbiota and eating behaviour in circadian syndrome.
 02.08.2024, _JR Soliz-Rueda, C Cuesta-Marti, SM O'Mahony, G Clarke, H Schellekens, B Muguerza_


Eating behaviour and circadian rhythms are closely related. The type, timing, and quantity of food consumed, and host circadian rhythms, directly influence the intestinal microbiota, which in turn impacts host circadian rhythms and regulates food intake beyond homeostatic eating. This Opinion discusses the impact of food intake and circadian disruptions induced by an obesogenic environment on gut-brain axis signalling. We also explore potential mechanisms underlying the effects of altered gut microbiota on food intake behaviour and circadian rhythmicity. Understanding the crosstalk between gut microbiota, circadian rhythms, and unhealthy eating behaviour is crucial to addressing the obesity epidemic, which remains one of the biggest societal challenges of our time.

The resident microbiome in food industries may impact on food quality and safety. In particular, microbes residing on surfaces in dairy industries may actively participate in cheese fermentation and ripening and contribute to the typical flavor and texture. In this work, we carried out an extensive microbiome mapping in 73 cheese-making industries producing different types of cheeses (fresh, medium and long ripened) and located in 4 European countries. We sequenced and analyzed metagenomes from cheese samples, raw materials and environmental swabs collected from both food contact and non-food contact surfaces, as well as operators' hands and aprons. Dairy plants were shown to harbor a very complex microbiome, characterized by high prevalence of genes potentially involved in flavor development, probiotic activities, and resistance to gastro-intestinal transit, suggesting that these microbes may potentially be transferred to the human gut microbiome. More than 6100 high-quality Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) were reconstructed, including MAGs from several Lactic Acid Bacteria species and putative new species. Although microbial pathogens were not prevalent, we found several MAGs harboring genes related to antibiotic resistance, highlighting that dairy industry surfaces represent a potential hotspot for antimicrobial resistance (AR) spreading along the food chain. Finally, we identified facility-specific strains that can represent clear microbial signatures of different cheesemaking facilities, suggesting an interesting potential of microbiome tracking for the traceability of cheese origin.

## Polyphenols: potent protectors against chronic diseases.
 02.08.2024, _G Shanmugam_


Polyphenols, abundant in plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, wine, and chocolate, offer significant health benefits. Known for their potent antioxidant properties, they combat oxidative stress by neutralising free radicals, crucial in preventing chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, cardiovascular issues, obesity, and diabetes. Polyphenols also exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, modulating gene expression and reducing inflammation associated with NCDs. Their anticancer activities involve inhibiting cancer cell growth and promoting apoptosis through various pathways. They enhance cardiovascular health by improving endothelial function, lowering blood pressure, and inhibiting atherosclerosis. Additionally, polyphenols improve metabolic health by enhancing insulin sensitivity and regulating glucose metabolism, aiding in diabetes and obesity management. These bioactive compounds interact with cellular pathways and gut microbiota, highlighting their multifaceted mechanisms. Integrating polyphenol-rich foods into diets could significantly improve health outcomes and alleviate NCD burdens, advocating for their inclusion in public health strategies and further research to optimise their potential.

Probiotic production in commercial culture media is expensive, so, it is necessary to design culture media based on "low-cost" components like agro-industrial by-products. Therefore, this study aimed to design an agro-industrial by-product-based culture media using whey, sugarcane molasses, and palm kernel cake as components to produce Lactococcus lactis A12, Priestia megaterium M4, and Priestia sp. M10 isolated from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) associated gut microbiota. Higher bacterial concentrations were achieved at high whey concentrations and low concentrations of sugarcane molasses and palm kernel cake (PKC) using agitation. The optimal conditions were whey, 3.84% w/v; sugarcane molasses, 7.39% w/v; PKC, 0.77% w/v; and agitation speed, 75 RPM. Bacterial growth under optimal conditions was compared to that in commercial Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. L. lactis A12 showed similar growth in the optimal media and BHI. The estimated cost of the culture media based on component prices was USD $ 3.01/L, which is 86.93% lower than BHI broth (USD $ 23.04/L). It was possible to design a "low-cost agro-industrial by-product-based culture media to produce L. lactis A12 and the two Priestia species under monoculture conditions.

## Gut Microbiome-Driven metabolites influence skin pigmentation in TYRP1 mutant Oujiang Color Common Carp.
 03.08.2024, _R Nathan Mandal, J Ke, N Hasan Kanika, X Hou, Z Zhang, P Zhang, H Chen, C Zeng, X Chen, J Wang, C Wang_


The gut microbiome plays a key role in regulating the gut-skin axis, and host genetics partially influence this regulation. The study investigated the role of gut microbiota and host genetics in the gut-skin axis, focusing on the unusual "coffee-like" color phenotype observed in TYRP1 mutant Oujiang Color Common Carp. We employed comparative high-throughput omics data from wild-type and mutant fish to quantify the influence of both genetics and gut microbes on skin transcriptomic expression and blood metabolites. We found 525 differential metabolites (DMs) and 45 distinct gut microbial genera in TYRP1 mutant fish compared to wild type. Interaction and causal mediation analyses revealed a complex interplay. The TYRP1 mutation likely triggers an inflammatory pathway involving Acinetobacter bacteria, Leukotrience-C4 and Spermine. This inflammatory response appears to be counterbalanced by an anti-inflammatory cardiovascular genetic network. The net effect is the upregulation of COMT, PLG, C2, C3, F10, TDO2, MHC1, and SERPINF2, leading to unusual coffee-like coloration. This study highlights the intricate interplay between gut microbiota, host genetics, and metabolic pathways in shaping complex phenotypes.

## A novel strategy of artificially regulating plant rhizosphere microbial community to promote plant tolerance to cold stress.
 02.08.2024, _J Zhang, K Song, F Jin, F Jia, J Liang, F Wang, J Zhang_


Artificial regulation of plant rhizosphere microbial communities through the synthesis of microbial communities is one of the effective ways to improve plant stress resistance. However, the process of synthesizing stress resistant microbial communities with excellent performance is complex, time-consuming, and costly. To address this issue, we proposed a novel strategy for preparing functional microbial communities. We isolated a cultivable cold tolerant bacterial community (PRCBC) from the rhizosphere of peas, and studied its effectiveness in assisting rice to resist stress. The results indicate that PRCBC can not only improve the ability of rice to resist cold stress, but also promote the increase of rice yield after cold stress relieved. This is partly because PRCBC increases the nitrogen content in the rhizosphere soil, and promotes rice's absorption of nitrogen elements, thereby promoting rice growth and enhancing its ability to resist osmotic stress. More importantly, the application of PRCBC drives the succession of rice rhizosphere microbial communities, and promotes the succession of rice rhizosphere microbial communities towards stress resistance. Surprisingly, PRCBC drives the succession of rice rhizosphere microbial communities towards a composition similar to PRCBC. This provides a feasible novel method for artificially and directionally driving microbial succession. In summary, we not only proposed a novel and efficient strategy for preparing stress resistant microbial communities to promote plant stress resistance, but also unexpectedly discovered a possible directionally driving method for soil microbial community succession.

Despite Corylus avellana L. being an economically important shrub species known for its resilience to adverse environmental conditions, it constantly faces attacks from a plethora of biotic entities. Among these, the mite pest Phytoptus avellanae is gaining importance, causing economic losses every year. This mite colonises the new generative and vegetative buds, leading them to become swollen and reddish, and drastically reducing hazelnut production. The biology behind gall formation is still poorly understood. This study provides a qualitative and quantitative description of the microbiome in both healthy and infested buds of two economically important hazelnut cultivars through metabarcoding of fungal ITS and bacterial 16 S. Potentially pathogenic genera such as Fusarium and Pseudomonas were predominant in the infested buds, along with the obligate intracellular bacterial genus Wolbachia. Akanthomyces muscarius was instead isolated from culture-based methods only from the infested buds. These findings could improve the understanding of gall ecology, supporting the management of mite populations, and they could also serve as a milestone for further studies on low-impact, monitoring-driven, and genetically targeted control strategies.

## Integrating viruses into soil food web biogeochemistry.

The soil microbiome is recognized as an essential component of healthy soils. Viruses are also diverse and abundant in soils, but their roles in soil systems remain unclear. Here we argue for the consideration of viruses in soil microbial food webs and describe the impact of viruses on soil biogeochemistry. The soil food web is an intricate series of trophic levels that span from autotrophic microorganisms to plants and animals. Each soil system encompasses contrasting and dynamic physicochemical conditions, with labyrinthine habitats composed of particles. Conditions are prone to shifts in space and time, and this variability can obstruct or facilitate interactions of microorganisms and viruses. Because viruses can infect all domains of life, they must be considered as key regulators of soil food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling. We highlight future research avenues that will enable a more robust understanding of the roles of viruses in soil function and health.

## Rhizosphere microbiome assembly, drivers and functions in perennial ligneous plant health.
 01.08.2024, _M Duret, A Wallner, M Buée, A Aziz_


Plants shape and interact continuously with their rhizospheric microbiota, which play a key role in plant health and resilience. However, plant-associated microbial community can be shaped by several factors including plant phenotype and cropping system. Thus, understanding the interplay between microbiome assembly during the onset of plant-pathogen interactions and long-lasting resistance traits in ligneous plants remains a major challenge. To date, such attempts were mainly investigated in herbaceous plants, due to their phenotypic characteristics and their short life cycle. However, only few studies have focused on the microbial structure, dynamic and their drivers in perennial ligneous plants. Ligneous plants coevolved in interaction with specific fungal and bacterial communities that differ from those of annual plants. The specificities of such ligneous plants in shaping their own functional microbial communities could be dependent on their high heterozygosis, physiological and molecular status associated to seasonality and their aging processes, root system and above-ground architectures, long-lasting climatic variations, and specific cultural practices. This article provides an overview of the specific characteristics of perennial ligneous plants that are likely to modulate symbiotic interactions in the rhizosphere, thus affecting the plant's fitness and systemic immunity. Plant and microbial traits contributing to the establishment of plant-microbiome interactions and the adaptation of this holobiont are also discussed.

Symbioses between primary producers and bacteria are crucial for nutrient exchange that fosters host growth and niche adaptation. Yet, how viruses that infect bacteria (phages) influence these bacteria-eukaryote interactions is still largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of viruses on the genomic diversity and functional adaptations of bacteria associated with pelagic sargassum. This brown alga has dramatically increased its distribution range in the Atlantic in the past decade and is predicted to continue expanding, imposing severe impacts on coastal ecosystems, economies, and human health.
