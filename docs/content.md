This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

Saliva is a readily accessible and inexpensive biological specimen that enables investigation of the oral microbiome, which can serve as a biomarker of oral and systemic health. There are two routine approaches to collect saliva, stimulated and unstimulated; however, there is no consensus on how sampling method influences oral microbiome metrics. In this study, we analyzed paired saliva samples (unstimulated and stimulated) from 88 individuals, aged 7-18 years. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we investigated the differences in bacterial microbiome composition between sample types and determined how sampling method affects the distribution of taxa associated with untreated dental caries and gingivitis. Our analyses indicated significant differences in microbiome composition between the sample types. Both sampling methods were able to detect significant differences in microbiome composition between healthy subjects and subjects with untreated caries. However, only stimulated saliva revealed a significant association between microbiome diversity and composition in individuals with diagnosed gingivitis. Furthermore, taxa previously associated with dental caries and gingivitis were preferentially enriched in individuals with each respective disease only in stimulated saliva. Our study suggests that stimulated saliva provides a more nuanced readout of microbiome composition and taxa distribution associated with untreated dental caries and gingivitis compared to unstimulated saliva.

Alterations in the composition and abundance of the intestinal microbiota occur in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the results are inconsistent because of differences in the study design, subject area, and sequencing methodology. In this study, we compared the diversity and abundance of the intestinal microbiota of patients with NAFLD and healthy individuals through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

## Gut microbiota differences in stunted and normal-lenght children aged 36-45 months in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia.

The role of the gut microbiota in energy metabolism of the host has been established, both in overweight/obesity, as well as in undernutrition/stunting. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may predispose to stunting. The aim of this study was to compare the gut microbiota composition of stunted Indonesian children and non-stunted children between 36 and 45 months from two sites on the East Nusa Tenggara (ENT) islands. Fecal samples were collected from 100 stunted children and 100 non-stunted children in Kupang and North Kodi. The gut microbiota composition was determined by sequencing amplicons of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Moreover, fecal SCFA concentrations were analyzed. The microbiota composition was correlated to anthropometric parameters and fecal metabolites. The phyla Bacteroidetes (Bacteroidota; q = 0.014) and Cyanobacteria (q = 0.049) were significantly higher in stunted children. Three taxa at genus levels were consistently significantly higher in stunted children at both sampling sites, namely Lachnoclostridium, Faecalibacterium and Veillonella (q &lt; 7 * 10-4). These and 9 other taxa positively correlated to the z-score length-for-age (zlen), while 11 taxa negatively correlated with zlen. Several taxa also correlated with sanitary parameters, some of which were also significantly different between the two groups. All three fecal SCFA concentrations (acetate, propionate and butyrate) and their total were lower in stunted children compared to non-stunted children, although not significant for butyrate, indicating lower energy-extraction by the gut microbiota. Also, since SCFA have been shown to be involved in gut barrier function, barrier integrity may be affected in the stunted children. It remains to be seen if the three taxa are involved in stunting, or are changed due to e.g. differences in diet, hygiene status, or other factors. The observed differences in this study do not agree with our previous observations in children on Java, Indonesia. There are differences in infrastructure facilities such as clean water and sanitation on ENT and Java, which may contribute to the differences observed. The role of the gut microbiota in stunting therefore requires more in depth studies. Trial registration: the trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier number NCT05119218.

## Recommendations for the Use of Dietary Fiber to Improve Blood Pressure Control.
 08.04.2024, _HA Jama, M Snelson, AE Schutte, J Muir, FZ Marques_


According to several international, regional, and national guidelines on hypertension, lifestyle interventions are the first-line treatment to lower blood pressure (BP). Although diet is one of the major lifestyle modifications described in hypertension guidelines, dietary fiber is not specified. Suboptimal intake of foods high in fiber, such as in Westernized diets, is a major contributing factor to mortality and morbidity of noncommunicable diseases due to higher BP and cardiovascular disease. In this review, we address this deficiency by examining and advocating for the incorporation of dietary fiber as a key lifestyle modification to manage elevated BP. We explain what dietary fiber is, review the existing literature that supports its use to lower BP and prevent cardiovascular disease, describe the mechanisms involved, propose evidence-based target levels of fiber intake, provide examples of how patients can achieve the recommended targets, and discuss outstanding questions in the field. According to the evidence reviewed here, the minimum daily dietary fiber for adults with hypertension should be &gt;28 g/day for women and &gt;38 g/day for men, with each extra 5 g/day estimated to reduce systolic BP by 2.8 mm Hg and diastolic BP by 2.1 mm Hg. This would support a healthy gut microbiota and the production of gut microbiota-derived metabolites called short-chain fatty acids that lower BP. Awareness about dietary fiber targets and how to achieve them will guide medical teams on better educating patients and empowering them to increase their fiber intake and, as a result, lower their BP and cardiovascular disease risk.

## Editors' Commentary on the 2023 ESH Management of Arterial Hypertension Guidelines.
 03.10.2023, _PK Whelton, JM Flack, G Jennings, A Schutte, J Wang, RM Touyz_


_Humans, Antihypertensive Agents, Hypertension, Blood Pressure, Blood Pressure Determination, Cardiology_
Clinical practice guidelines are ideally suited to the provision of advice on the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure (BP). The recently published European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension is the latest in a long series of high BP clinical practice guidelines. It closely resembles the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guidelines, with incremental rather than major changes. Although the ESH guidelines are primarily written for European clinicians and public health workers, there is a high degree of concordance between its recommendations and those in the other major BP guidelines. Despite the large number of national and international BP guidelines around the world, general population surveys demonstrate that BP guidelines are not being well implemented in any part of the world. The level of BP, which is the basis for diagnosis and management, continues to be poorly measured in routine clinical practice and control of hypertension remains suboptimal, even to a conservative BP target such as a systolic/diastolic BP &lt;140/90 mm Hg. BP guidelines need to focus much more on implementation of recommendations for accurate diagnosis and strategies for improved control in those being treated for hypertension. An evolving body of implementation science can assist in meeting this goal. Given the enormous health, social, and financial burden of high BP, better diagnosis and management should be an imperative for clinicians, government, and others responsible for the provision of health care services. Hopefully, the 2023 ESH will help enable this.

## Continuous glucose monitoring and intrapersonal variability in fasting glucose.
 08.04.2024, _S Shilo, A Keshet, H Rossman, A Godneva, Y Talmor-Barkan, Y Aviv, E Segal_


Plasma fasting glucose (FG) levels play a pivotal role in the diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes worldwide. Here we investigated FG values using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices in nondiabetic adults aged 40-70 years. FG was measured during 59,565 morning windows of 8,315 individuals (7.16 ± 3.17 days per participant). Mean FG was 96.2 ± 12.87 mg dl-1, rising by 0.234 mg dl-1 per year with age. Intraperson, day-to-day variability expressed as FG standard deviation was 7.52 ± 4.31 mg dl-1. As there are currently no CGM-based criteria for diabetes diagnosis, we analyzed the potential implications of this variability on the classification of glycemic status based on current plasma FG-based diagnostic guidelines. Among 5,328 individuals who would have been considered to have normal FG based on the first FG measurement, 40% and 3% would have been reclassified as having glucose in the prediabetes and diabetes ranges, respectively, based on sequential measurements throughout the study. Finally, we revealed associations between mean FG and various clinical measures. Our findings suggest that careful consideration is necessary when interpreting FG as substantial intraperson variability exists and highlight the potential impact of using CGM data to refine glycemic status assessment.

## Intestinal microbiome profiles in broiler chickens raised without antibiotics exhibit altered microbiome dynamics relative to conventionally raised chickens.
 06.04.2024, _SH Kairmi, K Abdelaziz, H Spahany, J Astill, D Trott, B Wang, A Wang, J Parkinson, S Sharif_


_Animals, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Chickens, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Microbiota, Cecum, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes_
The present study was undertaken to profile and compare the cecal microbial communities in conventionally (CONV) grown and raised without antibiotics (RWA) broiler chickens. Three hundred chickens were collected from five CONV and five RWA chicken farms on days 10, 24, and 35 of age. Microbial genomic DNA was extracted from cecal contents, and the V4-V5 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified and sequenced. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequence data indicated significant differences in the cecal microbial diversity and composition between CONV and RWA chickens on days 10, 24, and 35 days of age. On days 10 and 24, CONV chickens had higher richness and diversity of the cecal microbiome relative to RWA chickens. However, on day 35, this pattern reversed such that RWA chickens had higher richness and diversity of the cecal microbiome than the CONV groups. On days 10 and 24, the microbiomes of both CONV and RWA chickens were dominated by members of the phylum Firmicutes. On day 35, while Firmicutes remained dominant in the RWA chickens, the microbiome of CONV chickens exhibited am abundance of Bacteroidetes. The cecal microbiome of CONV chickens was enriched with the genus Faecalibacterium, Pseudoflavonifractor, unclassified Clostridium_IV, Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Butyricimonas, whereas the cecal microbiome of RWA chickens was enriched with genus Anaerofilum, Butyricicoccu, Clostridium_XlVb and unclassified Lachnospiraceae. Overall, the cecal microbiome richness, diversity, and composition were greatly influenced by the management program applied in these farms. These findings provide a foundation for further research on tailoring feed formulation or developing a consortium to modify the gut microbiome composition of RWA chickens.

## Decoding populations in the ocean microbiome.
 04.04.2024, _R Logares_


_Animals, Ecosystem, Microbiota, Oceans and Seas, Metagenomics_
Understanding the characteristics and structure of populations is fundamental to comprehending ecosystem processes and evolutionary adaptations. While the study of animal and plant populations has spanned a few centuries, microbial populations have been under scientific scrutiny for a considerably shorter period. In the ocean, analyzing the genetic composition of microbial populations and their adaptations to multiple niches can yield important insights into ecosystem function and the microbiome's response to global change. However, microbial populations have remained elusive to the scientific community due to the challenges associated with isolating microorganisms in the laboratory. Today, advancements in large-scale metagenomics and metatranscriptomics facilitate the investigation of populations from many uncultured microbial species directly from their habitats. The knowledge acquired thus far reveals substantial genetic diversity among various microbial species, showcasing distinct patterns of population differentiation and adaptations, and highlighting the significant role of selection in structuring populations. In the coming years, population genomics is expected to significantly increase our understanding of the architecture and functioning of the ocean microbiome, providing insights into its vulnerability or resilience in the face of ongoing global change.

## Progress toward a vaccine for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) II: efficacy of a toxin-autotransporter dual antigen approach.
 09.04.2024, _Y Xing, JR Clark, JD Chang, JJ Zulk, DM Chirman, F-A Piedra, EE Vaughan, HJ Hernandez Santos, KA Patras, AW Maresso_


Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) is a leading cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality, the top cause of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) infections, and the most frequent cause of life-threatening sepsis and urinary tract infections (UTI) in adults. The development of an effective and universal vaccine is complicated by this pathogen's pan-genome, its ability to mix and match virulence factors and AMR genes via horizontal gene transfer, an inability to decipher commensal from pathogens, and its intimate association and co-evolution with mammals. Using a pan virulome analysis of &gt;20,000 sequenced E. coli strains, we identified the secreted cytolysin α-hemolysin (HlyA) as a high priority target for vaccine exploration studies. We demonstrate that a catalytically inactive pure form of HlyA, expressed in an autologous host using its own secretion system, is highly immunogenic in a murine host, protects against several forms of ExPEC infection (including lethal bacteremia), and significantly lowers bacterial burdens in multiple organ systems. Interestingly, the combination of a previously reported autotransporter (SinH) with HlyA was notably effective, inducing near complete protection against lethal challenge, including commonly used infection strains ST73 (CFT073) and ST95 (UTI89), as well as a mixture of 10 of the most highly virulent sequence types and strains from our clinical collection. Both HlyA and HlyA-SinH combinations also afforded some protection against UTI89 colonization in a murine UTI model. These findings suggest recombinant, inactive hemolysin and/or its combination with SinH warrant investigation in the development of an E. coli vaccine against invasive disease.
