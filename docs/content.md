Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump.

Our aim was to assess the relationships of cardiovascular health metrics, cardiorespiratory fitness, lean mass, and fat percentage with arterial structure and function from childhood to adolescence.
