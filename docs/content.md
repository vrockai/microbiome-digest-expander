The impact of the gut microbiome on the initiation and intensity of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) prompted by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is widely acknowledged. Nevertheless, there is inconsistency in the gut microbial associations with irAEs reported across various studies.

There is an unmet need for biomarkers for the diagnosis of lung cancer and decision criteria for lung biopsy. We comparatively investigated the lung microbiomes of patients with lung cancer and benign lung diseases. Patients who underwent bronchoscopy at Chungnam National University Hospital between June 2021 and June 2022 were enrolled. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from 24 patients each with lung cancer and benign lung diseases. The samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA-based metagenomic sequencing. We found that alpha diversity and the beta diversity distribution (P = 0.001) differed significantly between patients with benign lung diseases and those with lung cancer. Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in patients with lung cancer (33.39% ± 17.439), whereas Bacteroidota was the most abundant phylum in patients with benign lung disease (31.132% ± 22.505), respectively. In differential abundance analysis, the most differentially abundant microbiota taxon was unclassified_SAR202_clade, belonging to the phylum Chloroflexi. The established prediction model distinguished patients with benign lung disease from those with lung cancer with a high accuracy (micro area under the curve [AUC] = 0.98 and macro AUC = 0.99). The BALF microbiome may be a novel biomarker for the detection of lung cancer.

Significant differences have been discovered between subtypes of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The role of gut microbiota in promoting the onset of UC and CD is established, but conclusions regarding subtype-specific analyses remain limited.
