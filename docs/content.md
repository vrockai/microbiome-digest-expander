 23.02.2024, _G Conte, SA Pacino, S Urso, D Greiling, P Caponnetto, E Pedullà, L Generali, U Consolo, V Checchi, S Gospodaru, G Bordeniuc, V Fala, J Kowalski, M Nowak, R Górska, A Amaliya, I Chapple, M Milward, R Maclure, GM Nardi, R Polosa_


Although the detrimental effects of conventional combustible cigarettes on oral health and dental esthetics are well known, there is limited information about the long-term impact of combustion-free nicotine alternatives (C-F NA) such as e-cigarettes or heated tobacco products.

## Formulation and development of novel Sulfasalazine bilayer tablets for the treatment of arthritis associated with IBD: In-vitro and In-vivo Investigations.
 24.02.2024, _S Jadiya, N Upmanyu, A Sathiyanarayanan, V Jain, R Dubey, P Buwade_


Sulfasalazine needs frequent daily dosing and the administration of numerous tablets per day pose challenges to patient compliance, contributing to increased adverse effects and difficulties in disease control. These inconveniences result in less effective treatment for arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease i.e. ulcerative colitis etc. To improve drug bioavailability, a delayed-release mechanism that releases the drug at the colon is necessary. To develop and optimise colon-targeted controlled release bilayer tablets coated with pH-dependent polymers. The bilayer tablets containing the immediate release part and sustained release part were developed. The tablets were coated with enteric-coated with Eudragit® S-100 and L-100 to achieve release in the colon. Granule properties and tablets were evaluated. The physicochemical parameters of the tablets were evaluated including, stability study, and drug release in 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2), pH 6.8 phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer for 2, 1, and up to 24 hours respectively. Radiographic imaging and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were also done in Rabbits. The bilayer tablets containing immediate and sustained release were successfully developed for the colon targeting. The granule properties were found within the acceptable range indicating good flow properties. The physicochemical properties of the tablets were also found acceptable. The tablets did not show release in 0.1 N HCl and 6.8 phosphate buffer but drug release was found under control in the 7.4 pH buffer. Sulfasalazine coated bilayer tablets were found stable and no significant changes were observed in the stability studies. Based on the X-ray studies, the formulated tablet remained discernible in the stomach, small intestine, and colon for a duration of up to 24 hours. Finally, by the 32nd hour, the tablet was no longer visible in the X-ray examination, leading to the conclusion of complete drug release. The drug concentration in plasma remained within the therapeutic range for up to 24 hours in vivo. These novel formulations present substantial advantages, providing prolonged targeted drug release and reducing systemic adverse effects. The results suggest promising potential for treating arthritis in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, offering a solution to current delivery systems.

## Inter-epitope spacer variation within polytopic L2-based human papillomavirus antigens affects immunogenicity.
 24.02.2024, _Y Zhang, FC Mariz, P Sehr, G Spagnoli, KM Koenig, S Çelikyürekli, T Kreuziger, X Zhao, A Bolchi, S Ottonello, M Müller_


The human papillomavirus minor capsid protein L2 is being extensively explored in pre-clinical studies as an attractive vaccine antigen capable of inducing broad-spectrum prophylactic antibody responses. Recently, we have developed two HPV vaccine antigens - PANHPVAX and CUT-PANHPVAX- both based on heptameric nanoparticle antigens displaying polytopes of the L2 major cross-neutralizing epitopes of eight mucosal and twelve cutaneous HPV types, respectively. Prompted by the variable neutralizing antibody responses against some of the HPV types targeted by the antigens observed in previous studies, here we investigated the influence on immunogenicity of six distinct glycine-proline spacers inserted upstream to a specific L2 epitope. We show that spacer variants differentially influence antigen immunogenicity in a mouse model, with the antigen constructs M8merV6 and C12merV6 displaying a superior ability in the induction of neutralizing antibodies as determined by pseudovirus-based neutralization assays (PBNAs). L2-peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assessments determined the total anti-L2 antibody level for each antigen variant, showing for the majority of sera a correlation with their repective neutralizing antibody level. Surface Plasmon Resonance revealed that L2 epitope-specific, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) display distinct avidities to different antigen spacer variants. Furthermore, mAb affinity toward individual spacer variants was well correlated with their neutralizing antibody induction capacity, indicating that the mAb affinity assay predicts L2-based antigen immunogenicity. These observations provide insights on the development and optimization of L2-based HPV vaccines.
