 02.02.2021, _X Liu, B Mao, J Gu, J Wu, S Cui, G Wang, J Zhao, H Zhang, W Chen_


Blautia is a genus of anaerobic bacteria with probiotic characteristics that occur widely in the feces and intestines of mammals. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses, some species in the genera Clostridium and Ruminococcus have been reclassified as Blautia, so to date, there are 20 new species with valid published names in this genus. An extensive body of research has recently focused on the probiotic effects of this genus, such as biological transformation and its ability to regulate host health and alleviate metabolic syndrome. This article reviews the origin and biological characteristics of Blautia and the factors that affect its abundance and discusses its role in host health, thus laying a theoretical foundation for the development of new functional microorganisms with probiotic properties.

## Bacterial associations in the healthy human gut microbiome across populations.
 06.02.2021, _M Loftus, SA Hassouneh, S Yooseph_


In a microbial community, associations between constituent members play an important role in determining the overall structure and function of the community. The human gut microbiome is believed to play an integral role in host health and disease. To understand the nature of bacterial associations at the species level in healthy human gut microbiomes, we analyzed previously published collections of whole-genome shotgun sequence data, totaling over 1.6 Tbp, generated from 606 fecal samples obtained from four different healthy human populations. Using a Random Forest Classifier, we identified 202 signature bacterial species that were prevalent in these populations and whose relative abundances could be used to accurately distinguish between the populations. Bacterial association networks were constructed with these signature species using an approach based on the graphical lasso. Network analysis revealed conserved bacterial associations across populations and a dominance of positive associations over negative associations, with this dominance being driven by associations between species that are closely related either taxonomically or functionally. Bacterial species that form network modules, and species that constitute hubs and bottlenecks, were also identified. Functional analysis using protein families suggests that much of the taxonomic variation across human populations does not foment substantial functional or structural differences.

## The Pre-treatment Gut Microbiome is Associated with Lack of Response to Methotrexate in New Onset Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Although oral methotrexate (MTX) remains the anchor drug for RA, up to 50% of patients do not achieve a clinically adequate outcome. Concomitantly, there is a lack of prognostic tools for treatment response prior to drug initiation. Here we study whether inter-individual differences in the human gut microbiome can aid in the prediction of MTX efficacy in new-onset RA (NORA).

## Antibiotic-associated dysbiosis affects the ability of the gut microbiota to control intestinal inflammation upon fecal microbiota transplantation in experimental colitis models.
 07.02.2021, _F Strati, M Pujolassos, C Burrello, MR Giuffrè, G Lattanzi, F Caprioli, J Troisi, F Facciotti_


The gut microbiota plays a central role in host physiology and in several pathological mechanisms in humans. Antibiotics compromise the composition and functions of the gut microbiota inducing long-lasting detrimental effects on the host. Recent studies suggest that the efficacy of different clinical therapies depends on the action of the gut microbiota. Here, we investigated how different antibiotic treatments affect the ability of the gut microbiota to control intestinal inflammation upon fecal microbiota transplantation in an experimental colitis model and in ex vivo experiments with human intestinal biopsies.

## Impacts of Earthworm Introduction and Cadmium on Microbial Communities Composition and Function in Soil.
 05.02.2021, _C Ren, Y Teng, X Chen, Y Shen, H Xiao, H Wang_


Heavy metal contamination of soil has become a public concern. Earthworms are key players in the functioning and service of soil ecosystems, with comprehension of their introduction in the polluted soil offering new insights into the protection of soil resources. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of earthworm (Eisenia fetida) introduction and Cd (0, 10, 30, and 60 mg kg-1 of Cd) exposure upon soil microbial community using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Our research demonstrated that Gemmatimonadetes and Deinococcus-Thermus upregulated significantly, while Chryseolinea showed an obvious decreasing trend after earthworm introduction. In Cd contaminated soil, many genera exhibited a greater presence of Cd-dependent bacteria, namely Cd-tolerant bacteria such as Altererythrobacter and Luteimonas, and a decrease of sensitive bacteria, such as Amaricoccus and Haliangium. Moreover, functional prediction analysis of soil microbiota indicated that earthworm introduction and Cd exposure changed functional pathways of soil microorganisms. The results obtained in this study are beneficial for understanding soil microbial community impacted by earthworm, and for exploring Cd resistant or tolerant bacteria, with potentially significant findings for soil biodiversity and Cd bioremediation.

Imidacloprid, used against mango hopper, is a persistent insecticide in soil. Microbes have the ability to remove toxic pesticides from soil surface. Metagenomic is an approach for understanding the diversity and related metabolic activities in any environmental sample without culturing the microbes. Metagenomic analysis of mango orchard soil was carried out using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to understand the impact of imidacloprid on soil microbial population. In control and imidacloprid applied soil samples, representative sequences clustered were 0.142930 and 0.082320 million, respectively. At the kingdom level, 85 and 88 percent represented to bacteria, 2 and 1 percent to archaea, and 13 and 11 percent to unassigned for control and treated metagenomes, respectively. At phylum level, 16 and 17 percent of OTUs (operational taxonomic units) were assigned with Proteobacteria, while 13 and 11 percent of OTUs were unassigned in control and imidacloprid-treated samples, respectively. The other abundant phyla in both the samples were Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. At class level, 9 and 11 percent of OTUs were assigned with Planctomycetia in control as well as imidacloprid-treated samples, respectively. A number of OTUs present in control and imidacloprid applied samples are 31,173 and 21,909, respectively, with 18,018 number of OTUs shared between the two samples. The genus Gemmata totally disappeared in imidacloprid applied soil, while those belonging to class Phycisphaerae, genus Prevotella and species copri were identified in imidacloprid treatment. Bacterial community transformation was evident from this study indicating possible microbial bioremediation of imidacloprid in mango orchard soil.
