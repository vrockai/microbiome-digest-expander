H2S imbalances in the intestinal tract trigger Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disorder characterized by microbiota dysbiosis and barrier dysfunction. However, a comprehensive understanding of H2S generation in the gut, and the contributions of both microbiota and host to systemic H2S levels in CD, remain to be elucidated. This investigation aimed to enhance comprehension regarding the sulfidogenic potential of both the human host and the gut microbiota.

Gut dysbiosis is closely related to dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in the intestinal epithelial cells, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). We investigated the relationship between fecal gut microbiome (GM) and intestinal tissue miRNAs in different stages of pediatric CD. Metagenomic analysis and miRNA sequencing were conducted to examine the GM and intestinal miRNA profiles of CD patients before and after clinical induction therapy and the controls. Twenty-seven newly diagnosed, therapy-naïve pediatric patients with active CD and 11 non-inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) controls were recruited in this study. Among CD patients, 11 patients completed induction treatment and reached clinical remission. Both GM and miRNA profiles were significantly changed between CD patients and controls. Seven key bacteria were identified at species level including Defluviitalea raffinosedens, Thermotalea metallivorans, Roseburia intestinalis, Dorea sp. AGR2135, Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei, and Salmonella enterica, the exact proportions of which were further validated by real-time quantitative PCR analysis. Eight key miRNAs were also identified including hsa-miR-215-5p, hsa-miR-194-5p, hsa-miR-12135, hsa-miR-509-3-5p, hsa-miR-212-5p, hsa-miR-4448, hsa-miR-501-3p, and hsa-miR-503-5p. The functional enrichment analysis of differential miRNAs indicated the significantly altered cyclin protein, cyclin-dependent protein, and cell cycle pathway. The close interactions between seven key bacteria and eight key miRNAs were further investigated by miRNA target prediction. The association between specific miRNA expressions and key gut bacteria at different stages of CD supported their important roles as potential molecular biomarkers. Understanding the relationship between them will help us to explore the molecular mechanisms of CD.
