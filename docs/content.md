## Bacterial and eukaryotic extracellular vesicles and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: new players in the gut-liver axis?
 20.01.2021, _A Villard, J Boursier, R Andriantsitohaina_


The liver and intestine communicate in a bi-directional way through the biliary tract, portal vein, and other components of the gut-liver axis. The gut microbiota is one of the major contributors to the production of several proteins and bile acids. Imbalance in the gut bacterial community, called dysbiosis, participates in the development and progression of several chronic liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is currently considered the main chronic liver disease worldwide. Dysbiosis contributes to NAFLD development and progression, notably by a greater translocation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the blood. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a PAMP that activates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), induces liver inflammation, and participates in the development of fibrogenesis. LPS can be transported by bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are spherical structures produced by eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells that transfer information to distant cells and may represent new players in NAFLD development and progression. The present review summarizes the role of eukaryotic EVs, either circulating or tissue-derived, in NAFLD features, such as liver inflammation, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. Circulating EV levels are dynamic and correlate with disease stage and severity. However, scarce information is available concerning the involvement of bacterial EVs in liver disease. The present review highlights a potential role of bacterial EVs in insulin resistance and liver inflammation, although the mechanism involved has not been elucidated. Additionally, because of their distinct signatures, eukaryotic and prokaryotic EVs may also represent a promising NAFLD diagnostic tool as a "liquid biopsy" in the future.

## Potential Contribution of the Intestinal Microbiome to Phenethylamine-Induced Hyperthermia.
 20.01.2021, _A Aburahma, S Pachhain, SR Choudhury, S Rana, V Phuntumart, R Larsen, JE Sprague_


Phenethylamines (e.g., methamphetamine) are a common source of drug toxicity. Phenethylamine-induced hyperthermia (PIH) can activate a cascade of events that may result in rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, and even death. Here, we review recent evidence that suggests a potential link between the gut-brain axis and PIH. Within the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, phenethylamines lead to changes in catecholamine levels, that activate the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and increase the peripheral levels of norepinephrine (NE), resulting in: (1) the loss of heat dissipation through α1 adrenergic receptor (α1-AR)-mediated vasoconstriction, (2) heat generation through β-AR activation and subsequent free fatty acid (FFA) activation of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in brown and white adipose tissue, and (3) alteration of the gut microbiome and its link to the gut-brain axis. Recent studies have shown that phenethylamine derivatives can influence the composition of the gut microbiome and thus its metabolic potential. Phenethylamines increase the relative level of Proteuswhich has been linked to enhanced NE turnover. Bidirectional fecal microbial transplants (FMT) between PIH-tolerant and PIH-naïve rats demonstrated that the transplantation of gut microbiome can confer phenotypic hyperthermic and tolerant responses to phenethylamines. These phenethylamine-mediated changes in the gut microbiome were also associated with epigenetic changes in the mediators of thermogenesis. Given the significant role that the microbiome has been shown to play in the maintenance of body temperature, we outline current studies demonstrating the effects of phenethylamines on the gut microbiome and how these microbiome changes may mechanistically contribute to alterations in body temperature.

## Fecal and mucosal microbiota profiling in pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases.
 20.01.2021, _L Putignani, S Oliva, S Isoldi, F Del Chierico, C Carissimi, I Laudadio, S Cucchiara, L Stronati_


An altered gut microbiota profile has been widely documented in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The intestinal microbial community has been more frequently investigated in the stools than at the level of the mucosa, while most of the studies have been performed in adults. We aimed to define the gut microbiota profile either by assessing fecal and colonic mucosa samples (inflamed or not) from pediatric IBD patients.

## Infection trains the host for microbiota-enhanced resistance to pathogens.
 20.01.2021, _A Stacy, V Andrade-Oliveira, JA McCulloch, B Hild, JH Oh, PJ Perez-Chaparro, CK Sim, AI Lim, VM Link, M Enamorado, G Trinchieri, JA Segre, B Rehermann, Y Belkaid_


The microbiota shields the host against infections in a process known as colonization resistance. How infections themselves shape this fundamental process remains largely unknown. Here, we show that gut microbiota from previously infected hosts display enhanced resistance to infection. This long-term functional remodeling is associated with altered bile acid metabolism leading to the expansion of taxa that utilize the sulfonic acid taurine. Notably, supplying exogenous taurine alone is sufficient to induce this alteration in microbiota function and enhance resistance. Mechanistically, taurine potentiates the microbiota's production of sulfide, an inhibitor of cellular respiration, which is key to host invasion by numerous pathogens. As such, pharmaceutical sequestration of sulfide perturbs the microbiota's composition and promotes pathogen invasion. Together, this work reveals a process by which the host, triggered by infection, can deploy taurine as a nutrient to nourish and train the microbiota, promoting its resistance to subsequent infection.

## Changes of Gut Microbiota and Its Correlation With Short Chain Fatty Acids and Bioamine in Piglets at the Early Growth Stage.
 20.01.2021, _R Qi, X Qiu, L Du, J Wang, Q Wang, J Huang, Z Liu_


The change characteristics of intestinal microbial succession and the correlation with the production of two important types of bacterial metabolites (short chain fatty acids and bioamine) in piglets during the early stage were fully explored in this study. Six piglets from different litters with the same birth time were selected, weighted and euthanized at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days of age. During this stage, the piglets grew quickly with gradual increases in blood levels of growth hormone and insulin, and in the intestinal developmental index and immunity. 16s rRNA analysis indicated the alpha diversity of colonic microbiome community was higher than ileum. However, the composition change in the ileal microbiota was more dramatic over time. Lactobacillus genus was the dominant bacteria in piglets' ileum while Prevotella and Ruminococcaceae genera were the dominant bacteria in colon up to weaning. Gut bacterial community of the piglets showed obvious differences between the three different phases: newborn, before weaning, and post weaning. This was similar to the morphological change pattern of pigs' gut. Total SCFA content in the colon of pigs showed almost a 20-fold increase at day 42 compared to the value at day 1. The percentage of acetic acid among the total SCFAs dropped quickly from 74.5% at day 1 to 36.5% at day 42, while butyric acid and propionic acid showed significant increases at the stage. The histamine level increased and putrescine level decreased markedly in the colon with time while the amounts of total bioamines, tyramine and spermidine were devoid of changes. Dozens bacteria taxa showed highly correlations with SCFAs and bioamines. These findings provide an expanded view of the dynamic pig gut and gut microbiome at the important early growth stage.

## Prospecting Human Milk Oligosaccharides as a Defense Against Viral Infections.
 20.01.2021, _RE Moore, LL Xu, SD Townsend_


In addition to providing maximal nutritional value for neonatal growth and development, human milk functions as an early defense mechanism against invading pathogens. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are abundant in human milk, are a diverse group of heterogeneous carbohydrates with wide ranging protective effects. In addition to promoting the colonization of beneficial intestinal flora, HMOs serve as decoy receptors, effectively blocking the attachment of pathogenic bacteria. HMOs also function as bacteriostatic agents, inhibiting the growth of gram-positive bacteria. Based on this precedence, an emerging area in the field has focused on characterizing the antiviral properties of HMOs. Indeed, HMOs have been evaluated as antiviral agents, with many possessing activity against life-threatening infections. This targeted review provides insight into the known glycan-binding interactions between select HMOs and influenza, rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and norovirus. Additionally, we review the role of HMOs in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis, an intestinal disease linked to viral infections. We close with a discussion of what is known broadly regarding human milk oligosaccharides and their interactions with coronaviruses.

## TIPP2: metagenomic taxonomic profiling using phylogenetic markers.
 20.01.2021, _N Shah, EK Molloy, M Pop, T Warnow_


Metagenomics has revolutionized microbiome research by enabling researchers to characterize the composition of complex microbial communities. Taxonomic profiling is one of the critical steps in metagenomic analyses. Marker genes, which are single-copy and universally found across Bacteria and Archaea, can provide accurate estimates of taxon abundances in the sample.

## Precision long-read metagenomics sequencing for food safety by detection and assembly of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in irrigation water.
 14.01.2021, _M Maguire, JA Kase, D Roberson, T Muruvanda, EW Brown, M Allard, SM Musser, N González-Escalona_


Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) contamination of agricultural water might be an important factor to recent foodborne illness and outbreaks involving leafy greens. Closed bacterial genomes from whole genome sequencing play an important role in source tracking. We aimed to determine the limits of detection and classification of STECs by qPCR and nanopore sequencing using 24 hour enriched irrigation water artificially contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 (EDL933). We determined the limit of STEC detection by qPCR to be 30 CFU/reaction, which is equivalent to 105 CFU/ml in the enrichment. By using Oxford Nanopore's EPI2ME WIMP workflow and de novo assembly with Flye followed by taxon classification with a k-mer analysis software (Kraken2), E. coli O157:H7 could be detected at 103 CFU/ml (68 reads) and a complete fragmented E. coli O157:H7 metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) was obtained at 105-108 CFU/ml. Using a custom script to extract the E. coli reads, a completely closed MAG was obtained at 107-108 CFU/ml and a complete, fragmented MAG was obtained at 105-106 CFU/ml. In silico virulence detection for E. coli MAGs for 105-108 CFU/ml showed that the virulotype was indistinguishable from the spiked E. coli O157:H7 strain. We further identified the bacterial species in the un-spiked enrichment, including antimicrobial resistance genes, which could have important implications to food safety. We propose this workflow provides proof of concept for faster detection and complete genomic characterization of STECs from a complex microbial sample compared to current reporting protocols and could be applied to determine the limit of detection and assembly of other foodborne bacterial pathogens.
