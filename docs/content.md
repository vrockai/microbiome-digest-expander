## Gut microbiota in overweight and obesity: crosstalk with adipose tissue.
 08.12.2023, _PD Cani, M Van Hul_


Overweight and obesity are characterized by excessive fat mass accumulation produced when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. One plausible way to control energy expenditure is to modulate thermogenic pathways in white adipose tissue (WAT) and/or brown adipose tissue (BAT). Among the different environmental factors capable of influencing host metabolism and energy balance, the gut microbiota is now considered a key player. Following pioneering studies showing that mice lacking gut microbes (that is, germ-free mice) or depleted of their gut microbiota (that is, using antibiotics) developed less adipose tissue, numerous studies have investigated the complex interactions existing between gut bacteria, some of their membrane components (that is, lipopolysaccharides), and their metabolites (that is, short-chain fatty acids, endocannabinoids, bile acids, aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands and tryptophan derivatives) as well as their contribution to the browning and/or beiging of WAT and changes in BAT activity. In this Review, we discuss the general physiology of both WAT and BAT. Subsequently, we introduce how gut bacteria and different microbiota-derived metabolites, their receptors and signalling pathways can regulate the development of adipose tissue and its metabolic capacities. Finally, we describe the key challenges in moving from bench to bedside by presenting specific key examples.

 08.12.2023, _MAM Roslan, MN Omar, NAM Sharif, NHA Raston, MH Arzmi, HM Neoh, AB Ramzi_


The human microbiome has emerged as a key player in maintaining skin health, and dysbiosis has been linked to various skin disorders. Amidst growing concerns regarding the side effects of antibiotic treatments, the potential of live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) in restoring a healthy microbiome has garnered significant attention. This review aims to evaluate the current state of the art of the genetically or metabolically engineered LBPs, termed single-cell engineered LBPs (eLBPs), for skin repair and disease treatment. While some studies demonstrate promising outcomes, the translation of eLBPs into clinical applications remains a significant hurdle. Substantial concerns arise regarding the practical implementation and scalability of eLBPs, despite the evident potential they hold in targeting specific cells and delivering therapeutic agents. This review underscores the need for further research, robust clinical trials, and the exploration of current advances in eLBP-based bioengineered bacterial chassis and new outlooks to substantiate the viability and effectiveness of eLBPs as a transformative approach in skin repair and disease intervention.

## Periodontitis salivary microbiota exacerbates colitis-induced anxiety-like behavior via gut microbiota.
 07.12.2023, _J Qian, J Lu, S Cheng, X Zou, Q Tao, M Wang, N Wang, L Zheng, W Liao, Y Li, F Yan_


The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system between the gut and central nervous system. Many host-related factors can affect gut microbiota, including oral bacteria, making the brain a vulnerable target via the gut-brain axis. Saliva contains a large number of oral bacteria, and periodontitis, a common oral disease, can change the composition of salivary microbiota. However, the role and mechanism of periodontitis salivary microbiota (PSM) on the gut-brain axis remain unclear. Herein, we investigated the nature and mechanisms of this relationship using the mice with dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced anxiety-like behavior. Compared with healthy salivary microbiota, PSM worsened anxiety-like behavior; it significantly reduced the number of normal neurons and activated microglia in DSS mice. Antibiotic treatment eliminated the effect of PSM on anxiety-like behavior, and transplantation of fecal microbiota from PSM-gavaged mice exacerbated anxiety-like behavior. These observations indicated that the anxiety-exacerbating effect of PSM was dependent on the gut microbiota. Moreover, the PSM effect on anxiety-like behavior was not present in non-DSS mice, indicating that DSS treatment was a prerequisite for PSM to exacerbate anxiety. Mechanistically, PSM altered the histidine metabolism in both gut and brain metabolomics. Supplementation of histidine-related metabolites had a similar anxiety-exacerbating effect as that of PSM, suggesting that histidine metabolism may be a critical pathway in this process. Our results demonstrate that PSM can exacerbate colitis-induced anxiety-like behavior by directly affecting the host gut microbiota, emphasizing the importance of oral diseases in the gut-brain axis.

## Genomic and Phenotypic Insight into the Probiotic Potential of Lactic Acid Bacterial spp. Associated with the Human Gut Mucosa.
 09.12.2023, _K Aziz, JA Gilbert, AH Zaidi_


Commensal microbiome-based health support is gaining respect in the medical community and new human gut-associated Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) strains must be evaluated for their probiotic potential. Here we characterized the phenotype and genomes of human ileocecal mucosa-associated LAB strains using metagenomic sequencing and in vitro testing. The strains characterized belonged to the genus Enterococcus (Enterococcus lactis NPL1366, NPL1371, and Enterococcus mundtii NPL1379) and Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus paragasseri, NPL1369, NPL1370, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NPL1378). Genome annotation suggested bacterial adaptation to both human physiological and industrial manufacturing-related stressors. Genes for histidine kinases in enterococci and Na + /K + antiporters and F0F1 ATP synthases in Lactobacillus strains may support their tolerance to acid seen in vitro. The bile salt hydrolase (BSH) gene in Lp. plantarum and L. paragasseri may help explain their reported bile salt deconjugation and cholesterol-lowering behavior. Thioredoxin is the principal antioxidant system, and several oxidases and general stress-related proteins are found in lactobacilli, most notably in L. plantarum NPL1378. Multiple adhesion and biofilm-related genes were predicted in the LAB genomes. Adhesion and biofilm-related genes figured prominently in the genomes of enterococcal strains, especially E. lactis, corresponding to its biofilm formation capacity in vitro. Bacteriocin and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters in the sequenced genomes of E. lactis NPL1366 and Lp. plantarum NPL1378 may explain their in vitro pathogenic antagonism. Moreover, folate producing Lp. plantarum strain holds potential to be used in therapeutics or biofortification of food. All the strains were deemed safe through in vitro and in silico analysis. This basic genetic and phenotypic information supports their contention as probiotic adjuncts to conventional medical therapy.

## A review on the use of prebiotics in ulcerative colitis.
 08.12.2023, _JM Kennedy, A De Silva, GE Walton, GR Gibson_


The gut microbiome in the inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), is different to that of healthy controls. Patients with UC have relative reductions in abundance of Firmicutes and Bifidobacterium in the colon, and an increase in sulfate-reducing bacteria. Prebiotics are dietary substrates which are selectively metabolised by the human colonic microbiota to confer health benefits to the host. This review explores our current understanding of the potential benefits of prebiotics on various clinical, biochemical, and microbiological endpoints in UC, including new perspectives gained from recent studies in the field. This review looks to the future and highlights the need for appropriately designed trials to explore this potentially exciting new avenue for the treatment of UC.

## Oral magnesium prevents acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury by modulating microbial metabolism.
 06.12.2023, _D Li, Y Chen, M Wan, F Mei, F Wang, P Gu, X Zhang, R Wei, Y Zeng, H Zheng, B Chen, Q Xiong, T Xue, T Guan, J Guo, Y Tian, LY Zeng, Z Liu, H Yuan, L Yang, H Liu, L Dai, Y Yu, Y Qiu, P Wu, S Win, TA Than, R Wei, B Schnabl, N Kaplowitz, Y Jiang, Q Ma, P Chen_


Acetaminophen overuse is a common cause of acute liver failure (ALF). During ALF, toxins are metabolized by enzymes such as CYP2E1 and transformed into reactive species, leading to oxidative damage and liver failure. Here, we found that oral magnesium (Mg) alleviated acetaminophen-induced ALF through metabolic changes in gut microbiota that inhibit CYP2E1. The gut microbiota from Mg-supplemented humans prevented acetaminophen-induced ALF in mice. Mg exposure modulated Bifidobacterium metabolism and enriched indole-3-carboxylic acid (I3C) levels. Formate C-acetyltransferase (pflB) was identified as a key Bifidobacterium enzyme involved in I3C generation. Accordingly, a Bifidobacterium pflB knockout showed diminished I3C generation and reduced the beneficial effects of Mg. Conversely, treatment with I3C or an engineered bacteria overexpressing Bifidobacterium pflB protected against ALF. Mechanistically, I3C bound and inactivated CYP2E1, thus suppressing formation of harmful reactive intermediates and diminishing hepatocyte oxidative damage. These findings highlight how interactions between Mg and gut microbiota may help combat ALF.

## Triangulating nutrigenomics, metabolomics and microbiomics toward personalized nutrition and healthy living.
 08.12.2023, _G Lagoumintzis, GP Patrinos_


The unique physiological and genetic characteristics of individuals influence their reactions to different dietary constituents and nutrients. This notion is the foundation of personalized nutrition. The field of nutrigenetics has witnessed significant progress in understanding the impact of genetic variants on macronutrient and micronutrient levels and the individual's responsiveness to dietary intake. These variants hold significant value in facilitating the development of personalized nutritional interventions, thereby enabling the effective translation from conventional dietary guidelines to genome-guided nutrition. Nevertheless, certain obstacles could impede the extensive implementation of individualized nutrition, which is still in its infancy, such as the polygenic nature of nutrition-related pathologies. Consequently, many disorders are susceptible to the collective influence of multiple genes and environmental interplay, wherein each gene exerts a moderate to modest effect. Furthermore, it is widely accepted that diseases emerge because of the intricate interplay between genetic predisposition and external environmental influences. In the context of this specific paradigm, the utilization of advanced "omic" technologies, including epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiome analysis, in conjunction with comprehensive phenotyping, has the potential to unveil hitherto undisclosed hereditary elements and interactions between genes and the environment. This review aims to provide up-to-date information regarding the fundamentals of personalized nutrition, specifically emphasizing the complex triangulation interplay among microbiota, dietary metabolites, and genes. Furthermore, it highlights the intestinal microbiota's unique makeup, its influence on nutrigenomics, and the tailoring of dietary suggestions. Finally, this article provides an overview of genotyping versus microbiomics, focusing on investigating the potential applications of this knowledge in the context of tailored dietary plans that aim to improve human well-being and overall health.

## The role of diet and host species in shaping the seasonal dynamics of the gut microbiome.
 09.12.2023, _CE Williams, AE Brown, CL Williams_


The gut microbiome plays an important role in the health and fitness of hosts. While previous studies have characterized the importance of various ecological and evolutionary factors in shaping the composition of the gut microbiome, most studies have been cross-sectional in nature, ignoring temporal variation. Thus, it remains unknown how these same factors might affect the stability and dynamics of the gut microbiome over time, resulting in variation across the tree of life. Here, we used samples collected in each of four seasons for three taxa: the herbivorous southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum, n = 5); carnivorous Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae, n = 5), and the red panda (Ailurus fulgens, n = 9), an herbivorous carnivore which underwent a diet shift in its evolutionary history from carnivory to a primarily bamboo-based diet. We characterize the variability of the gut microbiome among these three taxa across time to elucidate the influence of diet and host species on these dynamics. Altogether, we found that red pandas exhibit marked seasonal variation in their gut microbial communities, both experiencing high microbial community turnover as well as high variation in how individual red panda's gut microbiota respond to seasonal changes. Conversely, while the gut microbiota of rhinoceros change throughout the year, all individuals respond in the same way to seasonal changes. Tigers experience relatively low levels of turnover throughout the year, yet the ways in which individuals respond to seasonal transitions is more highly varied. We highlight how the differences in microbiome richness and network connectivity between these three species may affect the level of temporal stability in the gut microbiota across the year.

## Increased environmental microbial diversity reduces the disease risk of a mosquitocidal pathogen.
 06.12.2023, _Z Kang, VG Martinson, Y Wang, KL Coon, L Valzania, MR Strand_


The host-specific microbiotas of animals can both reduce and increase disease risks from pathogens. In contrast, how environmental microbial communities affect pathogens is largely unexplored. Aquatic habitats are of interest because water enables environmental microbes to readily interact with animal pathogens. Here, we focused on mosquitoes, which are important disease vectors as terrestrial adults but are strictly aquatic as larvae. We identified a pathogen of mosquito larvae from the field as a strain of Chromobacterium haemolyticum. Comparative genomic analyses and functional assays indicate this strain and other Chromobacterium are mosquitocidal but are also opportunistic pathogens of other animals. We also identify a critical role for diversity of the environmental microbiota in disease risk. Our study characterizes both the virulence mechanisms of a pathogen and the role of the environmental microbiota in disease risk to an aquatic animal of significant importance to human health.

## Metagenomics reveals effects of fluctuating water conditions on functional pathways in plant litter microbial community.
 08.12.2023, _M Likar, M Grašič, B Stres, M Regvar, A Gaberščik_


Climate change modifies environmental conditions, resulting in altered precipitation patterns, moisture availability and nutrient distribution for microbial communities. Changes in water availability are projected to affect a range of ecological processes, including the decomposition of plant litter and carbon cycling. However, a detailed understanding of microbial stress response to drought/flooding is missing. In this study, an intermittent lake is taken up as a model for changes in water availability and how they affect the functional pathways in microbial communities of the decomposing Phragmites australis litter. The results show that most enriched functions in both habitats belonged to the classes of Carbohydrates and Clustering-based subsystems (terms with unknown function) from SEED subsystems classification. We confirmed that changes in water availability resulted in altered functional makeup of microbial communities. Our results indicate that microbial communities under more frequent water stress (due to fluctuating conditions) could sustain an additional metabolic cost due to the production or uptake of compatible solutes to maintain cellular osmotic balance. Nevertheless, although prolonged submergence seemed to have a negative impact on several functional traits in the fungal community, the decomposition rate was not affected.

## Crop rotation and native microbiome inoculation restore soil capacity to suppress a root disease.
 08.12.2023, _Y Zhou, Z Yang, J Liu, X Li, X Wang, C Dai, T Zhang, VJ Carrión, Z Wei, F Cao, M Delgado-Baquerizo, X Li_


It is widely known that some soils have strong levels of disease suppression and prevent the establishment of pathogens in the rhizosphere of plants. However, what soils are better suppressing disease, and how management can help us to boost disease suppression remain unclear. Here, we used field, greenhouse and laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of management (monocropping and rotation) on the capacity of rhizosphere microbiomes in suppressing peanut root rot disease. Compared with crop rotations, monocropping resulted in microbial assemblies that were less effective in suppressing root rot diseases. Further, the depletion of key rhizosphere taxa in monocropping, which were at a disadvantage in the competition for limited exudates resources, reduced capacity to protect plants against pathogen invasion. However, the supplementation of depleted strains restored rhizosphere resistance to pathogen. Taken together, our findings highlight the role of native soil microbes in fighting disease and supporting plant health, and indicate the potential of using microbial inocula to regenerate the natural capacity of soil to fight disease.

## Environmental determinants and demographic influences on global urban microbiomes, antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity.
 07.12.2023, _Y Chen, X Fu, Z Ou, J Li, S Lin, Y Wu, X Wang, Y Deng, Y Sun_


Urban microbiome plays crucial roles in human health and are related to various diseases. The MetaSUB Consortium has conducted the most comprehensive global survey of urban microbiomes to date, profiling microbial taxa/functional genes across 60 cities worldwide. However, the influence of environmental/demographic factors on urban microbiome remains to be elucidated. We collected 35 environmental and demographic characteristics to examine their effects on global urban microbiome diversity/composition by PERMANOVA and regression models. PM10 concentration was the primary determinant factor positively associated with microbial α-diversity (observed species: p = 0.004, β = 1.66, R2 = 0.46; Fisher's alpha: p = 0.005, β = 0.68, R2 = 0.43), whereas GDP per capita was negatively associated (observed species: p = 0.046, β = -0.70, R2 = 0.10; Fisher's alpha: p = 0.004, β = -0.34, R2 = 0.22). The β-diversity of urban microbiome was shaped by seven environmental characteristics, including Köppen climate type, vegetation type, greenness fraction, soil type, PM2.5 concentration, annual average precipitation and temperature (PERMANOVA, p &lt; 0.001, R2 = 0.01-0.06), cumulatively accounted for 20.3% of the microbial community variance. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) identified microbial species most strongly associated with environmental characteristic variation. Cities in East Asia with higher precipitation showed an increased abundance of Corynebacterium metruchotii, and cities in America with a higher greenness fraction exhibited a higher abundance of Corynebacterium casei. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were negatively associated with GDP per capita and positively associated with solar radiation (p &lt; 0.005). Total pathogens prevalence was positively associated with urban population and negatively associated with average temperature in June (p &lt; 0.05). Our study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the influence of environmental/demographic characteristics on global urban microbiome. Our findings indicate that managing air quality and urban greenness is essential for regulating urban microbial diversity and composition. Meanwhile, socio-economic considerations, particularly reducing antibiotic usage in regions with lower GDP, are paramount in curbing the spread of antimicrobial resistance in urban environments.

## Multiple spatial scales of bacterial and fungal structural and functional traits affect carbon mineralization.
 08.12.2023, _Z Ma, S Jiao, K Zheng, H Ni, D Li, N Zhang, Y Yang, J Zhou, B Sun, Y Liang_


Studying the functional heterogeneity of soil microorganisms at different spatial scales and linking it to soil carbon mineralization is crucial for predicting the response of soil carbon stability to environmental changes and human disturbance. Here, a total of 429 soil samples were collected from typical paddy fields in China, and the bacterial and fungal communities as well as functional genes related to carbon mineralization in the soil were analysed using MiSeq sequencing and GeoChip gene microarray technology. We postulate that CO2 emissions resulting from bacterial and fungal carbon mineralization are contingent upon their respective carbon consumption strategies, which rely on the regulation of interactions between biodiversity and functional genes. Our results showed that the spatial turnover of the fungal community was 2-4 times that of the bacterial community from hundreds of meters to thousands of kilometres. The effect of spatial scale exerted a greater impact on the composition rather than the functional characteristics of the microbial community. Furthermore, based on the establishment of functional networks at different spatial scales, we observed that both bacteria and fungi within the top 10 taxa associated with carbon mineralization exhibited a prevalence of generalist species at the regional scale. This study emphasizes the significance of spatial scaling patterns in soil bacterial and fungal carbon degradation functions, deepening our understanding of how the relationship between microbial decomposers and soil heterogeneity impacts carbon mineralization and subsequent greenhouse gas emissions.

## Establishing genetic manipulation for novel strains of human gut bacteria.
 08.12.2023, _PO Sheridan, MA Odat, KP Scott_


Recent years have seen the development of high-accuracy and high-throughput genetic manipulation techniques, which have greatly improved our understanding of genetically tractable microbes. However, challenges remain in establishing genetic manipulation techniques in novel organisms, owing largely to exogenous DNA defence mechanisms, lack of selectable markers, lack of efficient methods to introduce exogenous DNA and an inability of genetic vectors to replicate in their new host. In this review, we describe some of the techniques that are available for genetic manipulation of novel microorganisms. While many reviews exist that focus on the final step in genetic manipulation, the editing of recipient DNA, we particularly focus on the first step in this process, the transfer of exogenous DNA into a strain of interest. Examples illustrating the use of these techniques are provided for a selection of human gut bacteria in which genetic tractability has been established, such as Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides and Roseburia. Ultimately, this review aims to provide an information source for researchers interested in developing genetic manipulation techniques for novel bacterial strains, particularly those of the human gut microbiota.
