Antibiotic application during the perinatal period is unavoidable in the clinic, but the potential effects on mothers and infants remain unknown. Herein, 25 breast milk samples from mothers who received cefuroxime (CXM) or CXM + cefoxitin (CFX) treatments and fecal samples from their infants were collected to investigate the undesirable effects of antibiotics on the microbiota of mothers and neonates. Furthermore, five fecal samples of infants, whose mothers had antibiotic treatments, were collected at a 6-month postpartum follow-up visit to evaluate the long-term effects on infants' gut microbiota. Moreover, the relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in fecal samples was compared to investigate the transfer of ARGs in the infant gut microbiota. The results indicated that the antibiotic treatments had no influence on the microbiota of breast milk. The dominant bacterial phyla in the fecal samples changed to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria after antibiotic treatments, while the bacterial community showed a recuperative trend at the follow-up visits. In addition, the abundance of ARGs in the infant gut microbiota demonstrated a declining trend in the CXM- and CXM + CFX-treated groups, while ARG abundance presented a significant increasing trend after a 6-month recovery period.

Although gingivitis frequently occurs in young cats, spirochetes are often found in the early stages of periodontal disease. This study was conducted to determine the association between gingivitis and oral spirochetes in young cats and dogs. The degree of gingivitis was evaluated in a total of 68 cats and 31 dogs under one year of age, and plaques were collected from each carnassial. To detect spirochetes or Porphyromonas gulae in plaque samples, 16S rRNA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. All data were analyzed using Fisher's exact probability test and odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). The prevalence of gingivitis was significantly higher in young cats (92.6%) than in young dogs (45.2%). The positive rate of spirochetes by PCR in gingivitis cases was 85.4% in young cats and 15.4% in young dogs, and the positive rate of P. gulae was 66.7% in young cats and 15.4% in young dogs. Both results were significantly higher in young cats than in young dogs. In young cats, spirochetes were significantly associated with gingivitis (OR = 7.95; 95% CI = 1.17, 53.83; P &lt; 0.05), but P. gulae was not (OR = 2.44; 95% CI = 0.38, 15.66; P = 0.23). These results suggest that spirochetes may be associated with the early stages of periodontal disease in cats.

## Maternal rumen and milk microbiota shapes the establishment of early-life rumen microbiota in grazing yak calves.
 29.01.2023, _W Guo, SS Bi, WW Wang, M Zhou, ALA Neves, AA Degen, LL Guan, RJ Long_


Early-life gut microbial colonization and development exert a profound impact on the health and metabolism of the host throughout the life span. The transmission of microbes from the mother to the offspring affects the succession and establishment of the early-life rumen microbiome in newborns, but the contributions of different maternal sites to the rumen microbial establishment remain unclear. In the present study, samples from different dam sites (namely, oral, rumen fluid, milk, and teat skin) and rumen fluid of yak calves were collected at 6 time points between d 7 and 180 postpartum to determine the contributions of the different maternal sites to the establishment of the bacterial and archaeal communities in the rumen during early life. Our analysis demonstrated that the dam's microbial communities clustered according to the sites, and the calves' rumen microbiota resembled that of the dam consistently regardless of fluctuations at d 7 and 14. The dam's rumen microbiota was the major source of the calves' rumen bacteria (7.9%) and archaea (49.7%) compared with the other sites, whereas the potential sources of the calf rumen microbiota from other sites varied according to the age. The contribution of dam's rumen bacteria increased with age from 0.36% at d 7 to 14.8% at d 180, whereas the contribution of the milk microbiota showed the opposite trend, with its contribution reduced from 2.7% at d 7 to 0.2% at d 180. Maternal oral archaea were the main sources of the calves' rumen archaea at d 14 (50.4%), but maternal rumen archaea became the main source gradually and reached 66.2% at d 180. These findings demonstrated the potential microbial transfer from the dam to the offspring that could influence the rumen microbiota colonization and establishment in yak calves raised under grazing regimens, providing the basis for future microbiota manipulation strategies during their early life.

## Local conditions matter: Minimal and variable effects of soil disturbance on microbial communities and functions in European vineyards.
 02.02.2023, _M Steiner, M Pingel, L Falquet, B Giffard, M Griesser, I Leyer, C Preda, D Uzman, S Bacher, A Reineke_


_Soil, Farms, Soil Microbiology, Microbiota, Herbicides_
Soil tillage or herbicide applications are commonly used in agriculture for weed control. These measures may also represent a disturbance for soil microbial communities and their functions. However, the generality of response patterns of microbial communities and functions to disturbance have rarely been studied at large geographical scales. We investigated how a soil disturbance gradient (low, intermediate, high), realized by either tillage or herbicide application, affects diversity and composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities as well as soil functions in vineyards across five European countries. Microbial alpha-diversity metrics responded to soil disturbance sporadically, but inconsistently across countries. Increasing soil disturbance changed soil microbial community composition at the European level. However, the effects of soil disturbance on the variation of microbial communities were smaller compared to the effects of location and soil covariates. Microbial respiration was consistently impaired by soil disturbance, while effects on decomposition of organic substrates were inconsistent and showed positive and negative responses depending on the respective country. Therefore, we conclude that it is difficult to extrapolate results from one locality to others because microbial communities and environmental conditions vary strongly over larger geographical scales.

## Viral infection in the ocean-A journey across scales.

Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in the ocean and infect a wide range of microbial life across bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. In this essay, we take a journey across several orders of magnitude in the scales of biological organization, time, and space of host-virus interactions in the ocean, aiming to shed light on their ecological relevance. We start from viruses infecting microbial host cells by delivering their genetic material in seconds across nanometer-size membranes, which highjack their host's metabolism in a few minutes to hours, leading to a profound transcriptomic and metabolic rewiring. The outcome of lytic infection leads to a release of virions and signaling molecules that can reach neighboring cells a few millimeters away, resulting in a population whose heterogeneous infection level impacts the surrounding community for days. These population dynamics can leave unique metabolic and biogeochemical fingerprints across scales of kilometers and over several decades. One of the biggest challenges in marine microbiology is to assess the impact of viruses across these scales, from the single cell to the ecosystem level. Here, we argue that the advent of new methodologies and conceptual frameworks represents an exciting time to pursue these efforts and propose a set of important challenges for the field. A better understanding of host-virus interactions across scales will inform models of global ocean ecosystem function in different climate change scenarios.
