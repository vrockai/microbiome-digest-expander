Candida auris is a newly emerged multidrug-resistant fungus capable of causing invasive infections with high mortality. Despite intense efforts to understand how this pathogen rapidly emerged and spread worldwide, its environmental reservoirs are poorly understood. Here, we present a collaborative effort between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Center for Biotechnology Information, and GridRepublic (a volunteer computing platform) to identify C. auris sequences in publicly available metagenomic datasets. We developed the MetaNISH pipeline that uses SRPRISM to align sequences to a set of reference genomes and computes a score for each reference genome. We used MetaNISH to scan ~300,000 SRA metagenomic runs from 2010 onwards and identified five datasets containing C. auris reads. Finally, GridRepublic has implemented a prospective C. auris molecular monitoring system using MetaNISH and volunteer computing.

The infant gut microbiome is a crucial factor in health and development. In preterm infants, altered gut microbiome composition and function have been linked to serious neonatal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis, which can lead to long-term disability. Although many studies have described links between microbiome composition and disease risk, there is a need for biomarkers to identify infants at risk of these complications in practice. In this pilot study, we obtained stool samples from preterm infant participants longitudinally during the first postnatal months, and measured pH and redox, as well as SCFA content and microbiome composition by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. These outcomes were compared to clinical data to better understand the role of pH and redox in infant gut microbiome development and overall health, and to assess the potential utility of pH and redox as biomarkers. We found that infants born earlier or exposed to antibiotics exhibited increased fecal pH, and that redox potential increased with postnatal age. These differences may be linked to changes in SCFA content, which was correlated with pH and increased with age. Microbiome composition was also related to birth weight, age, pH, and redox. Our findings suggest that pH and redox may serve as biomarkers of metabolic state in the preterm infant gut.

The nasal cavity harbors diverse microbiota that contributes to human health and respiratory diseases. However, whether and to what extent the host genome shapes the nasal microbiome remains largely unknown. Here, by dissecting the human genome and nasal metagenome data from 1401 healthy individuals, we demonstrated that the top three host genetic principal components strongly correlated with the nasal microbiota diversity and composition. The genetic association analyses identified 63 genome-wide significant loci affecting the nasal microbial taxa and functions, of which 2 loci reached study-wide significance (p &lt; 1.7 × 10-10): rs73268759 within CAMK2A associated with genus Actinomyces and family Actinomycetaceae; and rs35211877 near POM121L12 with Gemella asaccharolytica. In addition to respiratory-related diseases, the associated loci are mainly implicated in cardiometabolic or neuropsychiatric diseases. Functional analysis showed the associated genes were most significantly expressed in the nasal airway epithelium tissue and enriched in the calcium signaling and hippo signaling pathway. Further observational correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses consistently suggested the causal effects of Serratia grimesii and Yokenella regensburgei on cardiometabolic biomarkers (cystine, glutamic acid, and creatine). This study suggested that the host genome plays an important role in shaping the nasal microbiome.

Nutrition has broad impacts on all physiological processes. However, how nutrition affects human immunity remains largely unknown. Here we explored the impact of a dietary intervention on both immunity and the microbiota by performing a post hoc analysis of a clinical trial in which each of the 20 participants sequentially consumed vegan or ketogenic diets for 2 weeks ( NCT03878108 ). Using a multiomics approach including multidimensional flow cytometry, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and metagenomic datasets, we assessed the impact of each diet, and dietary switch, on host immunity and the microbiota. Our data revealed that overall, a ketogenic diet was associated with a significant upregulation of pathways and enrichment in cells associated with the adaptive immune system. In contrast, a vegan diet had a significant impact on the innate immune system, including upregulation of pathways associated with antiviral immunity. Both diets significantly and differentially impacted the microbiome and host-associated amino acid metabolism, with a strong downregulation of most microbial pathways following ketogenic diet compared with baseline and vegan diet. Despite the diversity of participants, we also observed a tightly connected network between datasets driven by compounds associated with amino acids, lipids and the immune system. Collectively, this work demonstrates that in diverse participants 2 weeks of controlled dietary intervention is sufficient to significantly and divergently impact host immunity, which could have implications for precision nutritional interventions. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT03878108 .

## Metagenomic analyses of 7000 to 5500 years old coprolites excavated from the Torihama shell-mound site in the Japanese archipelago.

_Humans, Japan, Metagenome, Metagenomics, Genomics, Archaeology_
Coprolites contain various kinds of ancient DNAs derived from gut micro-organisms, viruses, and foods, which can help to determine the gut environment of ancient peoples. Their genomic information should be helpful in elucidating the interaction between hosts and microbes for thousands of years, as well as characterizing the dietary behaviors of ancient people. We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on four coprolites excavated from the Torihama shell-mound site in the Japanese archipelago. The coprolites were found in the layers of the Early Jomon period, corresponding stratigraphically to 7000 to 5500 years ago. After shotgun sequencing, we found that a significant number of reads showed homology with known gut microbe, viruses, and food genomes typically found in the feces of modern humans. We detected reads derived from several types of phages and their host bacteria simultaneously, suggesting the coexistence of viruses and their hosts. The food genomes provide biological evidence for the dietary behavior of the Jomon people, consistent with previous archaeological findings. These results indicate that ancient genomic analysis of coprolites is useful for understanding the gut environment and lifestyle of ancient peoples.

## Streptococcus anginosus promotes gastric inflammation, atrophy, and tumorigenesis in mice.

Streptococcus anginosus (S. anginosus) was enriched in the gastric mucosa of patients with gastric cancer (GC). Here, we show that S. anginosus colonized the mouse stomach and induced acute gastritis. S. anginosus infection spontaneously induced progressive chronic gastritis, parietal cell atrophy, mucinous metaplasia, and dysplasia in conventional mice, and the findings were confirmed in germ-free mice. In addition, S. anginosus accelerated GC progression in carcinogen-induced gastric tumorigenesis and YTN16 GC cell allografts. Consistently, S. anginosus disrupted gastric barrier function, promoted cell proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis. Mechanistically, we identified an S. anginosus surface protein, TMPC, that interacts with Annexin A2 (ANXA2) receptor on gastric epithelial cells. Interaction of TMPC with ANXA2 mediated attachment and colonization of S. anginosus and induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. ANXA2 knockout abrogated the induction of MAPK by S. anginosus. Thus, this study reveals S. anginosus as a pathogen that promotes gastric tumorigenesis via direct interactions with gastric epithelial cells in the TMPC-ANXA2-MAPK axis.

## Gut complement induced by the microbiota combats pathogens and spares commensals.
 27.01.2024, _M Wu, W Zheng, X Song, B Bao, Y Wang, D Ramanan, D Yang, R Liu, JC Macbeth, EA Do, WA Andrade, T Yang, HS Cho, FS Gazzaniga, M Ilves, D Coronado, C Thompson, S Hang, IM Chiu, JR Moffitt, A Hsiao, JJ Mekalanos, C Benoist, DL Kasper_


Canonically, the complement system is known for its rapid response to remove microbes in the bloodstream. However, relatively little is known about a functioning complement system on intestinal mucosal surfaces. Herein, we report the local synthesis of complement component 3 (C3) in the gut, primarily by stromal cells. C3 is expressed upon commensal colonization and is regulated by the composition of the microbiota in healthy humans and mice, leading to an individual host's specific luminal C3 levels. The absence of membrane attack complex (MAC) components in the gut ensures that C3 deposition does not result in the lysis of commensals. Pathogen infection triggers the immune system to recruit neutrophils to the infection site for pathogen clearance. Basal C3 levels directly correlate with protection against enteric infection. Our study reveals the gut complement system as an innate immune mechanism acting as a vigilant sentinel that combats pathogens and spares commensals.

## Complement in breast milk modifies offspring gut microbiota to promote infant health.
 24.01.2024, _D Xu, S Zhou, Y Liu, AL Scott, J Yang, F Wan_


Breastfeeding offers demonstrable benefits to newborns and infants by providing nourishment and immune protection and by shaping the gut commensal microbiota. Although it has been appreciated for decades that breast milk contains complement components, the physiological relevance of complement in breast milk remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that weanling mice fostered by complement-deficient dams rapidly succumb when exposed to murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (CR), whereas pups fostered on complement-containing milk from wild-type dams can tolerate CR challenge. The complement components in breast milk were shown to directly lyse specific members of gram-positive gut commensal microbiota via a C1-dependent, antibody-independent mechanism, resulting in the deposition of the membrane attack complex and subsequent bacterial lysis. By selectively eliminating members of the commensal gut community, complement components from breast milk shape neonate and infant gut microbial composition to be protective against environmental pathogens such as CR.

## Antidiabetic effects and mechanism of γ-polyglutamic acid on type II diabetes mice.
 30.01.2024, _Y Li, W Zhang, C Tang, C Wang, C Liu, Q Chen, K Yang, Y Gu, P Lei, H Xu, R Wang_


Diabetes is one of the foremost chronic non-communicable diseases worldwide, which significantly impacts people's quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the hypoglycemic effects of γ-polyglutamic acid (γ-PGA) on STZ-induced type II diabetes mice and its potential mechanisms. The results indicated that γ-PGA intervention contributed to reducing fasting blood glucose levels in diabetic mice, regulating lipid metabolism in type II diabetes mice, and improving insulin resistance. Additionally, γ-PGA could alleviate liver inflammation, enhancing the activity of hepatic antioxidant enzymes. Investigation into the insulin signaling pathway revealed that γ-PGA significantly increased the expression of INSR, IRS-1, Akt, PI3K in diabetic mice, thereby enhancing insulin sensitivity and improving insulin resistance to regulate glucose metabolism. High-throughput sequencing of mouse gut microbiota using 16S rRNA showed that γ-PGA increased the abundance and evenness of beneficial bacteria in the intestines of type II diabetic mice, inhibited the growth of harmful bacteria, and may exerted hypoglycemic effects by modulating and improving relevant metabolic pathways associated with diabetes symptoms. This study provides new insights into the treatment of type II diabetes and highlights the significant potential of γ-PGA in treating type II diabetes.

_Animals, Coleoptera, Bacteria, Diet, Microbiota, Tobacco Products_
Insect-microbial symbiosis contributes positively to the physiology of the insect and diet is considered as one important factor determining microbial symbiosis. In this study, we have characterized the microbiota of cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (Fabricius) on different diets and phases. The beetles were reared on different diet sources (exposed phase) for six generations and were reverted to their natal source (reverted phase) and further maintained for six more generations. The bacterial diversity and richness were higher in the exposed phase and once reverted to the natal source, the microbial abundance has re-assembled according to the natal diet source. There was re-assemblage of microbial composition in accordance to the diet and the bacterial cells are able to establish and proliferate on reverting to their natal source. The bacterial composition of the beetle was mainly dynamic and not transient where the bacterial cells were maintained at low abundance and were re-established according to the diet source. Overall, we found that the microbiota of cigarette beetle to be dynamic and bacterial composition to re-assemble in a diet-specific manner. The study provides insights on diet associated microbial plasticity of cigarette beetle and a further comprehensive understanding on mechanisms involved in microbial plasticity will help develop novel pest management strategies for this invasive insect pest.

The gut microbiome of domestic animals carries antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) which can be transmitted to the environment and humans, resulting in challenges of antibiotic resistance. Although it has been reported that the rumen microbiome of ruminants may be a reservoir of ARGs, the factors affecting the temporal dynamics of the rumen resistome are still unclear. Here, we collected rumen content samples of goats at 1, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84 days of age, analyzed their microbiome and resistome profiles using metagenomics, and assessed the temporal dynamics of the rumen resistome in goats at the early stage of life under a conventional feeding system.
