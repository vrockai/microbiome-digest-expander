## Microbial driven genetic variation in holobionts.
 30.04.2021, _I Zilber-Rosenberg, E Rosenberg_


Genetic variation in holobionts, (host and microbiome), occurring by changes in both host and microbiome genomes, can be observed from two perspectives: observable variations and the processes that bring about the variation. The observable includes the enormous genetic diversity of prokaryotes, which gave rise to eukaryotic organisms. Holobionts then evolved a rich microbiome with a stable core containing essential genes, less so common taxa, and a more diverse non-core enabling considerable genetic variation. The result being that, the human gut microbiome, for example, contains 1,000 times more unique genes than are present in the human genome. Microbial driven genetic variation processes in holobionts include: (1) Acquisition of novel microbes from the environment, which bring in multiple genes in one step, (2) amplification/reduction of certain microbes in the microbiome, that contribute to holobiont` s adaptation to changing conditions, (3) horizontal gene transfer between microbes and between microbes and host, (4) mutation, which plays an important role in optimizing interactions between different microbiota and between microbiota and host. We suggest that invertebrates and plants, where microbes can live intracellularly, have a greater chance of genetic exchange between microbiota and host, thus a greater chance of vertical transmission and a greater effect of microbiome on evolution of host than vertebrates. However, even in vertebrates the microbiome can aid in environmental fluctuations by amplification/reduction and by acquisition of novel microorganisms.

## Butyrate: A Link between Early Life Nutrition and Gut Microbiome in the Development of Food Allergy.
 30.04.2021, _M Di Costanzo, N De Paulis, G Biasucci_


Increased prevalence of food allergies in the last thirty years has been attributed to lifestyle changes in Westernized countries. Among the environmental factors, nutritional factors and their interaction with the gut microbiome in early life are thought to have an important role in the observed epidemiological change. The gut microbiome synthesizes bacterial metabolites, which represent a link among gut microbiome, nutrition, and immune system. The main metabolites produced by gut microbiome are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs have multiple beneficial effects on human health including protective effects in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Among SCFAs, butyrate is essential for maintaining gut immune homeostasis and exerts a pivotal role in immune tolerance with strong anti-inflammatory effects in allergic diseases. Recent findings suggest that butyrate takes part in the development of immunological tolerance to food, especially in the first 1000 days of life. Herein, we provide a critical review of the scientific literature on the role of butyrate for prevention and treatment of food allergies with focus on the complex interplay among early life nutrition, gut microbiome, and immune system.

## Next-Generation Probiotics and Their Metabolites in COVID-19.
 30.04.2021, _T Gautier, S David-Le Gall, A Sweidan, Z Tamanai-Shacoori, A Jolivet-Gougeon, O Lor√©al, L Bousarghin_


Since December 2019, a global pandemic has been observed, caused by the emergence of a new coronavirus, SARS CoV-2. The latter is responsible for the respiratory disease, COVID-19. The infection is also characterized by renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal dysfunctions suggesting the spread of the virus to other organs. A dysregulated immune response was also reported. To date, there is no measure to treat or prevent SARS CoV-2 infection. Additionally, as gut microbiota composition is altered in patients with COVID-19, alternative therapies using probiotics can be considered to fight SARS CoV-2 infection. This review aims at summarizing the current knowledge about next-generation probiotics (NGPs) and their benefits in viral respiratory tract infections and in COVID-19. We describe these bacteria, highlighted by studies using metagenomic approaches. In addition, these bacteria generate metabolites such as butyrate, desaminotyrosine, and secondary bile acid, suggested to prevent viral respiratory infections. Gut microbial metabolites transported via the circulation to the lungs could inhibit viral replication or improve the immune response against viruses. The use of probiotics and/or their metabolites may target either the virus itself and/or the immunologic process. However, this review showed that more studies are needed to determine the benefits of probiotics and metabolite products in COVID-19.

## Circulating bile acids as a link between the gut microbiota and cardiovascular health: Impact of Prebiotics, probiotics and polyphenol-rich foods.
 30.04.2021, _RAG Pushpass, S Alzoufairi, KG Jackson, JA Lovegrove_


Beneficial effects of probiotic, prebiotic and polyphenol-rich interventions on fasting lipid profiles have been reported, with changes in the gut microbiota composition believed to play an important role in lipid regulation. Primary bile acids, which are involved in the digestion of fats and cholesterol metabolism, can be converted by the gut microbiota to secondary bile acids, some species of which are less well reabsorbed and consequently may be excreted in the stool. This can lead to increased hepatic bile acid neo-synthesis, resulting in a net loss of circulating low density lipoprotein. Bile acids may therefore provide a link between the gut microbiota and cardiovascular health. This narrative review presents an overview of bile acid metabolism and the role of probiotics, prebiotics and polyphenol-rich foods in modulating circulating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers and bile acids. Although findings from human studies are inconsistent, there is growing evidence for associations between these dietary components and improved lipid CVD risk markers, attributed to modulation of the gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism. These include increased bile acid neo-synthesis, due to bile sequestering action, bile salt metabolising activity and effects of short chain fatty acids generated through bacterial fermentation of fibres. Animal studies have demonstrated effects on the FXR/FGF-15 axis and hepatic genes involved in bile acid synthesis (CYP7A1) and cholesterol synthesis (SREBP and HMGR). Further human studies are needed to determine the relationship between diet and bile acid metabolism and whether circulating bile acids can be utilised as a potential CVD risk biomarker.

## Two Gut Microbiota-Derived Toxins Are Closely Associated with Cardiovascular Diseases: A Review.
 30.04.2021, _T Yamashita, N Yoshida, T Emoto, Y Saito, KI Hirata_


Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have become a major health problem because of the associated high morbidity and mortality rates observed in affected patients. Gut microbiota has recently been implicated as a novel endocrine organ that plays critical roles in the regulation of cardiometabolic and renal functions of the host via the production of bioactive metabolites. This review investigated the evidence from several clinical and experimental studies that indicated an association between the gut microbiota-derived toxins and CVDs. We mainly focused on the pro-inflammatory gut microbiota-derived toxins, namely lipopolysaccharides, derived from Gram-negative bacteria, and trimethylamine N-oxide and described the present status of research in association with these toxins, including our previous research findings. Several clinical studies aimed at exploring the effectiveness of reducing the levels of these toxins to inhibit cardiovascular events are currently under investigation or in the planning stages. We believe that some of the methods discussed in this review to eliminate or reduce the levels of such toxins in the body could be clinically applied to prevent CVDs in the near future.

## Dietary Strategies for Management of Metabolic Syndrome: Role of Gut Microbiota Metabolites.
 30.04.2021, _S Croci, LI D'Apolito, V Gasperi, MV Catani, I Savini_


Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex pathophysiological state with incidence similar to that of a global epidemic and represents a risk factor for the onset of chronic non-communicable degenerative diseases (NCDDs), including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and some types of cancer. A plethora of literature data suggest the potential role of gut microbiota in interfering with the host metabolism, thus influencing several MetS risk factors. Perturbation of the gut microbiota's composition and activity, a condition known as dysbiosis, is involved in the etiopathogenesis of multiple chronic diseases. Recent studies have shown that some micro-organism-derived metabolites (including trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate) induce subclinical inflammatory processes involved in MetS. Gut microbiota's taxonomic species or abundance are modified by many factors, including diet, lifestyle and medications. The main purpose of this review is to highlight the correlation between different dietary strategies and changes in gut microbiota metabolites. We mainly focus on the validity/inadequacy of specific dietary patterns to reduce inflammatory processes, including leaky gut and subsequent endotoxemia. We also describe the chance of probiotic supplementation to interact with the immune system and limit negative consequences associated with MetS.

## Challenging Cosmetic Innovation: The Skin Microbiota and Probiotics Protect the Skin from UV-Induced Damage.
 30.04.2021, _D Souak, M Barreau, A Courtois, V Andr√©, C Duclairoir Poc, MGJ Feuilloley, M Gault_


Many studies performed in the last decade have focused on the cutaneous microbiota. It has been shown that this microbiota plays a key role in skin homeostasis. Considered as "a second barrier" to the environment, it is very important to know how it reacts to exogenous aggressions. The cosmetics industry has a started to use this microbiota as a source of natural ingredients, particularly ones that confer photoprotection against ultraviolet (UV) rays. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that bacterial molecules can block UV rays or reverse their harmful effects. Oral probiotics containing living microorganisms have also shown promising results in restoring skin homeostasis and reversing the negative effects of UV rays. Microbial-based active sunscreen compounds have huge potential for use as next-generation photoprotection products.

## Isolation and identification of a human intestinal bacterium capable of daidzein conversion.
 30.04.2021, _Y Guo, L Zhao, X Fang, Q Zhong, H Liang, W Liang, L Wang_


Equol, which produced from daidzein (one of the principal isoflavones), is recognized to be the most resultful in stimulating an estrogenic and antioxidant response. The daidzein transformation was studied during fermentation of five growth media inoculated with feces from a healthy human, and a daidzein conversion strain was isolated. To enrich the bacterial population involved in daidzein metabolism in a complex mixture, fecal samples were treated with antibiotics. The improved propidium monoazide combined with the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PMAxx-qPCR) assay showed that the ampicillin treatment of samples did result in a reduction of the total visible bacteria counts by 52.2% compared to the treatment without antibiotics. On this basis, the newly isolated rod-shaped, gram-positive anaerobic bacterium, named strain Y11 (MN560033), was able to metabolize daidzein to equol under anaerobic conditions, with a conversion ratio (equol ratio: the amount of equol produced/amount of supplemented daizein) of 0.56 over 120 h. The 16S rRNA partial sequence of the strain Y11 exhibited 99.8% identity to that of Slackia equolifaciens strain DZE (NR116295). This study will provide new insights into the biotransformation of equol from daidzein by intestinal microbiota from the strain-level and explore the possibility of probiotic interventions.

## Nutritional immunity: the impact of metals on lung immune cells and the airway microbiome during chronic respiratory disease.
 30.04.2021, _C Healy, N Munoz-Wolf, J Strydom, L Faherty, NC Williams, S Kenny, SC Donnelly, SM Cloonan_


Nutritional immunity is the sequestration of bioavailable trace metals such as iron, zinc and copper by the host to limit pathogenicity by invading microorganisms. As one of the most conserved activities of the innate immune system, limiting the availability of free trace metals by cells of the immune system serves not only to conceal these vital nutrients from invading bacteria but also operates to tightly regulate host immune cell responses and function. In the setting of chronic lung disease, the regulation of trace metals by the host is often disrupted, leading to the altered availability of these nutrients to commensal and invading opportunistic pathogenic microbes. Similarly, alterations in the uptake, secretion, turnover and redox activity of these vitally important metals has significant repercussions for immune cell function including the response to and resolution of infection. This review will discuss the intricate role of nutritional immunity in host immune cells of the lung and how changes in this fundamental process as a result of chronic lung disease may alter the airway microbiome, disease progression and the response to infection.

Childhood malnutrition is a multifactorial disease, responsible for nearly half of all deaths in children under five. Lately, the probable association of a dysbiotic gut to malnutrition is also being eagerly investigated. The current study is an attempt to investigate this purported association through assessing the abundance of major gut bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria), probionts (Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus), butyrogens (Faecalibacterium and Roseburia) and pathogens (Escherichia and Klebsiella).

## The sugar composition of the fibre in selected plant foods modulates weaning infants' gut microbiome composition and fermentation metabolites in vitro.
 30.04.2021, _SG Parkar, JKT Frost, D Rosendale, HM Stoklosinski, CMH Jobsis, DI Hedderley, P Gopal_


Eight plant-based foods: oat flour and pureed apple, blackcurrant, carrot, gold- and green-fleshed kiwifruit, pumpkin, sweetcorn, were pre-digested and fermented with pooled inocula of weaning infants' faecal bacteria in an in vitro hindgut model. Inulin and water were included as controls. The pre-digested foods were analysed for digestion-resistant fibre-derived sugar composition and standardised to the same total fibre concentration prior to fermentation. The food-microbiome interactions were then characterised by measuring microbial acid and gas metabolites, microbial glycosidase activity and determining microbiome structure. At the physiologically relevant time of 10 h of fermentation, the xyloglucan-rich apple and blackcurrant favoured a propiogenic metabolic and microbiome profile with no measurable gas production. Glucose-rich, xyloglucan-poor pumpkin caused the greatest increases in lactate and acetate (indicative of high fermentability) commensurate with increased bifidobacteria. Glucose-rich, xyloglucan-poor oats and sweetcorn, and arabinogalactan-rich carrot also increased lactate and acetate, and were more stimulatory of clostridial families, which are indicative of increased microbial diversity and gut and immune health. Inulin favoured a probiotic-driven consortium, while water supported a proteolytic microbiome. This study shows that the fibre-derived sugar composition of complementary foods may shape infant gut microbiome structure and metabolic activity, at least in vitro.

## Oral-Gut Microbiome Axis in Gastrointestinal Disease and Cancer.
 30.04.2021, _SY Park, BO Hwang, M Lim, SH Ok, SK Lee, KS Chun, KK Park, Y Hu, WY Chung, NY Song_


It is well-known that microbiota dysbiosis is closely associated with numerous diseases in the human body. The oral cavity and gut are the two largest microbial habitats, playing a major role in microbiome-associated diseases. Even though the oral cavity and gut are continuous regions connected through the gastrointestinal tract, the oral and gut microbiome profiles are well-segregated due to the oral-gut barrier. However, the oral microbiota can translocate to the intestinal mucosa in conditions of the oral-gut barrier dysfunction. Inversely, the gut-to-oral microbial transmission occurs as well in inter- and intrapersonal manners. Recently, it has been reported that oral and gut microbiomes interdependently regulate physiological functions and pathological processes. Oral-to-gut and gut-to-oral microbial transmissions can shape and/or reshape the microbial ecosystem in both habitats, eventually modulating pathogenesis of disease. However, the oral-gut microbial interaction in pathogenesis has been underappreciated to date. Here, we will highlight the oral-gut microbiome crosstalk and its implications in the pathogenesis of the gastrointestinal disease and cancer. Better understanding the role of the oral-gut microbiome axis in pathogenesis will be advantageous for precise diagnosis/prognosis and effective treatment.

## Effects of Whole-Grain and Sugar Content in Infant Cereals on Gut Microbiota at Weaning: A Randomized Trial.
 30.04.2021, _J Plaza-Diaz, MJ Bernal, S Schutte, E Chenoll, S Genov√©s, FM Codo√±er, A Gil, LM Sanchez-Siles_


The introduction of complementary foods during infancy marks an important step in the development of the infant gut microbiome. Infant cereals are popular weaning foods but consistent evidence on their effect on the intestinal microbiota, especially when differing in nutritional quality, is lacking. Fecal samples from 4-7-month-old Spanish infants who consumed infant cereals differing in whole grain and sugar content as first weaning foods were analyzed on changes in microbial composition by massively parallel sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene at baseline and after 7 weeks of intervention. Samples were obtained from a previous trial conducted in Spain demonstrating whole-grain cereal acceptability. In total, samples of 18 infants consuming 0% whole grain cereals with 24 g sugar (0-WG) and 25 infants consuming 50% whole grain cereals with 12 g sugar (50-WG) were analyzed. Microbial composition changed significantly over time (p = 0.001), per intervention group (p = 0.029) and per infant (p = 0.001). Abundance of genus Veillonella increased in both groups while Enterococcus decreased. Within the 0-WG group, phylum Actinobacteria decreased along with genus Bifidobacterium. In the 50-WG, we observed an increase in Lachnoclostridium and Bacteroides. In addition, 50-WG decreased Proteobacteria and Escherichia to levels lower than 0-WG. Although weaning itself appeared to be responsible for most changes, the increased presence of anaerobic fermenters together with inhibition of pathogenic Escherichia may indicate a supporting effect of infant cereals with 50% whole grains and a reduced sugar content over infant cereals manufactured with refined hydrolyzed flours on the infant microbiota. In fact, using a novel methodology for the identification of microbial signatures, we found two groups of microbial taxa predictive of infants consuming enriched whole-grain infant cereals with a high predictive value of about 93%.

## Association between Dietary Habits and Fecal Microbiota Composition in Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: A Pilot Study.

Intestinal dysbiosis seems to play a role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The present pilot study aimed to elucidate the association between nutrient intake and Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence with IBS symptoms and gut microbiota in IBS patients. The nutrient intake of 28 IBS patients and 21 controls was assessed through a food diary, the reference intake ranges (RIs) for energy-yielding macronutrients and the MD serving score (MDSS) index. MD adherence and nutrients intake were compared to IBS symptoms and fecal microbiota, obtained by 16S rRNA targeted-metagenomics. In IBS patients MDSS index was altered compared to controls (p &lt; 0.01). IBS patients with low-MD score reported severe abdominal pain and higher flatulence point-scales. Through Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), Erysipelotrichaceae were detected as a microbial biomarker in IBS patients with altered RIs for macronutrients intake, compared to controls. Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillus were associated to an altered carbohydrates intake in IBS patients, while specific taxonomic biomarkers, such as Aldercreuzia, Mogibacteriaceae, Rikenellaceae, Parabacteroides and F. prausnitzii were associated with an adequate intake of nutrient in these patients. This study supports an association between dietary patterns and gut microbial biomarkers in IBS patients. Further investigations are needed to clarify these connections.

## Altered Composition of Microbiota in Women with Ovarian Endometrioma: Microbiome Analyses of Extracellular Vesicles in the Peritoneal Fluid.
 30.04.2021, _SR Lee, JC Lee, SH Kim, YS Oh, HD Chae, H Seo, CS Kang, TS Shin_


Human microbiota refers to living microorganisms which colonize our body and crucially contribute to the metabolism of nutrients and various physiologic functions. According to recently accumulated evidence, human microbiota dysbiosis in the genital tract or pelvic cavity could be involved in the pathogenesis and/or pathophysiology of endometriosis. We aimed to investigate whether the composition of microbiome is altered in the peritoneal fluid in women with endometriosis. We recruited 45 women with histological evidence of ovarian endometrioma and 45 surgical controls without endometriosis. Following the isolation of extracellular vesicles from peritoneal fluid samples from women with and without endometriosis, bacterial genomic DNA was sequenced using next-generation sequencing of the 16S rDNA V3-V4 regions. Diversity analysis showed significant differences in the microbial community at phylum, class, order, family, and genus levels between the two groups. The abundance of Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, and Enhydrobacter significantly increased while the abundance of Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Rothia significantly decreased in the endometriosis group compared with those in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). These findings strongly suggest that microbiome composition is altered in the peritoneal environment in women with endometriosis. Further studies are necessary to verify whether dysbiosis itself can cause establishment and/or progression of endometriosis.

## A plasmid locus associated with Klebsiella clinical infections encodes a microbiome-dependent gut fitness factor.

Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is an important cause of healthcare-associated infections, which increases patient morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization costs. Gut colonization by Kp is consistently associated with subsequent Kp disease, and patients are predominantly infected with their colonizing strain. Our previous comparative genomics study, between disease-causing and asymptomatically colonizing Kp isolates, identified a plasmid-encoded tellurite (TeO3-2)-resistance (ter) operon as strongly associated with infection. However, TeO3-2 is extremely rare and toxic to humans. Thus, we used a multidisciplinary approach to determine the biological link between ter and Kp infection. First, we used a genomic and bioinformatic approach to extensively characterize Kp plasmids encoding the ter locus. These plasmids displayed substantial variation in plasmid incompatibility type and gene content. Moreover, the ter operon was genetically independent of other plasmid-encoded virulence and antibiotic resistance loci, both in our original patient cohort and in a large set (n = 88) of publicly available ter operon-encoding Kp plasmids, indicating that the ter operon is likely playing a direct, but yet undescribed role in Kp disease. Next, we employed multiple mouse models of infection and colonization to show that 1) the ter operon is dispensable during bacteremia, 2) the ter operon enhances fitness in the gut, 3) this phenotype is dependent on the colony of origin of mice, and 4) antibiotic disruption of the gut microbiota eliminates the requirement for ter. Furthermore, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we show that the ter operon enhances Kp fitness in the gut in the presence of specific indigenous microbiota, including those predicted to produce short chain fatty acids. Finally, administration of exogenous short-chain fatty acids in our mouse model of colonization was sufficient to reduce fitness of a ter mutant. These findings indicate that the ter operon, strongly associated with human infection, encodes factors that resist stress induced by the indigenous gut microbiota during colonization. This work represents a substantial advancement in our molecular understanding of Kp pathogenesis and gut colonization, directly relevant to Kp disease in healthcare settings.

## OTUs and ASVs Produce Comparable Taxonomic and Diversity from Shrimp Microbiota 16S Profiles Using Tailored Abundance Filters.
 30.04.2021, _R Garc√≠a-L√≥pez, F Cornejo-Granados, AA Lopez-Zavala, A Cota-Hu√≠zar, RR Sotelo-Mundo, B G√≥mez-Gil, A Ochoa-Leyva_


The interplay between shrimp immune system, its environment, and microbiota contributes to the organism's homeostasis and optimal production. The metagenomic composition is typically studied using 16S rDNA profiling by clustering amplicon sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and, more recently, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Establish the compatibility of the taxonomy, Œ±, and Œ≤ diversity described by both methods is necessary to compare past and future shrimp microbiota studies. Here, we used identical sequences to survey the V3 16S hypervariable-region using 97% and 99% OTUs and ASVs to assess the hepatopancreas and intestine microbiota of L. vannamei from two ponds under standardized rearing conditions. We found that applying filters to retain clusters &gt;0.1% of the total abundance per sample enabled a consistent taxonomy comparison while preserving &gt;94% of the total reads. The three sets turned comparable at the family level, whereas the 97% identity OTU set produced divergent genus and species profiles. Interestingly, the detection of organ and pond variations was robust to the clustering method's choice, producing comparable Œ± and Œ≤-diversity profiles. For comparisons on shrimp microbiota between past and future studies, we strongly recommend that ASVs be compared at the family level to 97% identity OTUs or use 99% identity OTUs, both using tailored frequency filters.

## Impact of pesticide/fertilizer mixtures on the rhizosphere microbial community of field-grown sugarcane.
 30.04.2021, _W Huang, Y Lu, L Chen, D Sun, Y An_


The rhizosphere microbial community is important for plant health and is shaped by numerous environmental factors. This study aimed to unravel the effects of a pesticide/fertilizer mixture on the soil rhizosphere microbiome of field-grown sugarcane. A field trial on sugarcane was conducted in Zhanjian City, Guangdong Province, China, and soil samples from the rhizosphere were collected after clothianidin pesticide and/or organic fertilizer treatments. The effects of pesticide and/or organic fertilizer treatments on the composition, diversity, and predictive function of the rhizosphere microbial communities were examined using 16S rRNA gene and ITS1 amplicon sequencing. Compared with the controls (no pesticide or fertilizer used), the microbial community that resulted from treatment with the pesticide/fertilizer mixture (SPF) had a higher relative bacterial diversity and fungal richness, and contributed more beneficial functions to sugarcane, including xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism of amino acids. The bacterial and fungal compositions at various taxonomic levels were not significantly different in SPF and SP (pesticide only) treatments compared to treatments without the pesticide, suggesting that the clothianidin addition did not cause a detrimental impact on the soil microbiome. Moreover, five bacterial genera, including Dyella, Sphingomonas, Catenulispora, Mucilaginibacter, and Tumebacillus, were significantly more abundant in the SPF and SP treatments, which could be associated with the pesticide addition. With the addition of organic fertilizers in SPF, the abundances of some soil-beneficial bacteria Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and Brevibacillus were highly increased. Our study provides insights into the interactions between the rhizosphere soil microbiome and pesticide-fertilizer integration, which may help improve the application of pesticide-fertilizer to sugarcane fields.

The aspiration these days is to apply rapid methods for parallel analysis of bacteriome and resistome of food samples to increase food safety and prevent antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) spreading. In this work, we used nanopore sequencing (NS) to determine the diversity and dynamics of the microbiome and resistome in two types of bean sprouts. We proved that NS provided an easy, quick, and reliable way to identify the microbiome and resistome of a food sample also. The species diversity obtained by NS and by cultivation methods with MALDI-TOF MS identification was comparable. In both samples, before and after cultivation (30 ¬∞C, 48 h), the dominant part of bacteriome formed Gammaproteobacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Erwiniaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Moraxellaceae) and then Firmicutes (Streptococcaceae). The diversity and abundance of single ARGs groups were comparable for both samples despite bacteriome differences. More than 50% of the detected ARGs alignments were mutations conferring resistance to aminoglycosides (16S rRNA), resistance to fluoroquinolones (gyrA, gyrB, parC, parD) and elfamycin (EF-Tu). ARGs encoding efflux pumps formed more than 30% of the detected alignments. Beta-lactamases were represented by many variants, but were less abundant.

## Sources and Assembly of Microbial Communities in Vineyards as a Functional Component of Winegrowing.
 30.04.2021, _RG Griggs, KL Steenwerth, DA Mills, D Cantu, NA Bokulich_


Microbiomes are integral to viticulture and winemaking - collectively termed winegrowing - where diverse fungi and bacteria can exert positive and negative effects on grape health and wine quality. Wine is a fermented natural product, and the vineyard serves as a key point of entry for quality-modulating microbiota, particularly in wine fermentations that are conducted without the addition of exogenous yeasts. Thus, the sources and persistence of wine-relevant microbiota in vineyards critically impact its quality. Site-specific variations in microbiota within and between vineyards may contribute to regional wine characteristics. This includes distinctions in microbiomes and microbiota at the strain level, which can contribute to wine flavor and aroma, supporting the role of microbes in the accepted notion of terroir as a biological phenomenon. Little is known about the factors driving microbial biodiversity within and between vineyards, or those that influence annual assembly of the fruit microbiome. Fruit is a seasonally ephemeral, yet annually recurrent product of vineyards, and as such, understanding the sources of microbiota in vineyards is critical to the assessment of whether or not microbial terroir persists with inter-annual stability, and is a key factor in regional wine character, as stable as the geographic distances between vineyards. This review examines the potential sources and vectors of microbiota within vineyards, general rules governing plant microbiome assembly, and how these factors combine to influence plant-microbe interactions relevant to winemaking.

## Draft Genome Sequences of Various Bacterial Phyla Isolated from the International Space Station.
 30.04.2021, _AC Simpson, C Urbaniak, NK Singh, JM Wood, M Debieu, NB O'Hara, CE Mason, K Venkateswaran_


Whole-genome sequences were generated from 96 bacterial strains of 14 species that were isolated from International Space Station surfaces during the Microbial Tracking 2 study. Continued characterization of this closed habitat's microbiome enables tracking of the spread and evolution of secondary pathogens, which is vital for astronaut health.
