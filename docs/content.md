This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

The infant gut microbiota affects childhood health. This pioneer microbiota may be vulnerable to antibiotic exposures, but could be supported by prebiotic oligosaccharides found in breast milk and some infant formulas. We sought to characterize the effects of several exposures on the neonatal gut microbiota, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and infant/maternal antimicrobial exposures. We profiled the stool microbiota of 1023 one-month-old infants from the KOALA Birth Cohort using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We quantified 15 HMOs in breast milk from the mothers of 220 infants, using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both breastfeeding and antibiotic exposure decreased gut microbial diversity, but each was associated with contrasting shifts in microbiota composition. Other factors associated with microbiota composition included C-section, homebirth, siblings, and exposure to animals. Neither infant exposure to oral antifungals nor maternal exposure to antibiotics during pregnancy were associated with infant microbiota composition. Four distinct groups of breast milk HMO compositions were evident, corresponding to maternal Secretor status and Lewis group combinations defined by the presence/absence of certain fucosylated HMOs. However, we found the strongest evidence for microbiota associations between two non-fucosylated HMOs: 6'-sialyllactose (6'-SL) and lacto-N-hexaose (LNH), which were associated with lower and higher relative abundances of Bifidobacterium, respectively. Among 111 exclusively formula-fed infants, the GOS-supplemented formula was associated with a lower relative abundance of Clostridium perfringens. In conclusion, the gut microbiota is sensitive to some prebiotic and antibiotic exposures during early infancy and understanding their effects could inform future strategies for safeguarding a health-promoting infant gut microbiota.

## Joint Analysis of Microbial and Immune Cell Abundance in Liver Cancer Tissue Using a Gene Expression Profile Deconvolution Algorithm Combined With Foreign Read Remapping.
 16.07.2022, _D Ai, Y Xing, Q Zhang, Y Wang, X Liu, G Liu, LC Xia_

Recent transcriptomics and metagenomics studies showed that tissue-infiltrating immune cells and bacteria interact with cancer cells to shape oncogenesis. This interaction and its effects remain to be elucidated. However, it is technically difficult to co-quantify immune cells and bacteria in their respective microenvironments. To address this challenge, we herein report the development of a complete a bioinformatics pipeline, which accurately estimates the number of infiltrating immune cells using a novel Particle Swarming Optimized Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR) algorithm, and the number of infiltrating bacterial using foreign read remapping and the GRAMMy algorithm. It also performs systematic differential abundance analyses between tumor-normal pairs. We applied the pipeline to a collection of paired liver cancer tumor and normal samples, and we identified bacteria and immune cell species that were significantly different between tissues in terms of health status. Our analysis showed that this dual model of microbial and immune cell abundance had a better differentiation (84%) between healthy and diseased tissue. Caldatribacterium sp., Acidaminococcaceae sp., Planctopirus sp., Desulfobulbaceae sp.,Nocardia farcinica as well as regulatory T cells (Tregs), resting mast cells, monocytes, M2 macrophases, neutrophils were identified as significantly different (Mann Whitney Test, FDR&lt; 0.05). Our open-source software is freely available from GitHub at https://github.com/gutmicrobes/PSO-SVR.git.

## SPCIS: Standardized Plant Community with Introduced Status database.

The movement of plant species across the globe exposes native communities to new species introductions. While introductions are pervasive, two aspects of variability underlie patterns and processes of biological invasions at macroecological scales. First, only a portion of introduced species become invaders capable of substantially impacting ecosystems. Second, species that do become invasive at one location may not be invasive in others; impacts depend on invader abundance and recipient species and conditions. Accounting for these phenomena is essential to accurately understand the patterns of plant invasion and explain the idiosyncratic results reflected in the literature on biological invasions. The lack of community-level richness and the abundance of data spanning broad scales and environmental conditions have until now hindered our understanding of invasions at a macroecological scale. To address this limitation, we leveraged quantitative surveys of plant communities in the USA and integrated and harmonized nine datasets into the Standardized Plant Community with Introduced Status (SPCIS) database. The database contains 14,056 unique taxa identified within 83,391 sampling units, of which 52.6% have at least one introduced species. The SPCIS database includes comparable information on plant species occurrence, abundance, and native status across the 50 U.S. States and Puerto Rico. SPCIS can be used to answer macro-scale questions about native plant communities and interactions with invasive plants. There are no copyright restrictions on the data, and we ask the users of this dataset to cite this paper, the respective paper(s) corresponding to the dataset sampling design (all references are provided in Data S1: Metadata S1: Class II-B-2), and the references described in Data S1: Metadata S1: Class III-B-4 as applicable to the dataset being utilized.

Allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis detects the relative abundance of alleles at heterozygous loci as a proxy for cis-regulatory variation, which affects the personal transcriptome and proteome. This study describes the development and application of an ASE analysis pipeline on a unique cohort of 87 well phenotyped and RNA sequenced patients from the Maastricht Cardiomyopathy Registry with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a complex genetic disorder with a remaining gap in explained heritability. Regulatory processes for which ASE is a proxy might explain this gap. We found an overrepresentation of known DCM-associated genes among the significant results across the cohort. In addition, we were able to find genes of interest that have not been associated with DCM through conventional methods such as genome-wide association or differential gene expression studies. The pipeline offers RNA sequencing data processing, individual and population level ASE analyses as well as group comparisons and several intuitive visualizations such as Manhattan plots and protein-protein interaction networks. With this pipeline, we found evidence supporting the case that cis-regulatory variation contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity of DCM. Additionally, our results highlight that ASE analysis offers an additional layer to conventional genomic and transcriptomic analyses for candidate gene identification and biological insight.

## Expression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase increases non-polar lipid accumulation in Nannochloropsis oceanica.
 18.01.2023, _C Südfeld, A Kiyani, K Wefelmeier, RH Wijffels, MJ Barbosa, S D'Adamo_


_Glycerol, Oils, Genetic Engineering, Glycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase, Stramenopiles, Microalgae, Biomass, Phosphates_
Microalgae are considered a suitable production platform for high-value lipids and oleochemicals. Several species including Nannochloropsis oceanica produce large amounts of essential [Formula: see text]-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which are integral components of food and feed and have been associated with health-promoting effects. N. oceanica can further accumulate high contents of non-polar lipids with chemical properties that render them a potential replacement for plant oils such as palm oil. However, biomass and lipid productivities obtained with microalgae need to be improved to reach commercial feasibility. Genetic engineering can improve biomass and lipid productivities, for instance by increasing carbon flux to lipids. Here, we report the overexpression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) in N. oceanica during favorable growth conditions as a strategy to increase non-polar lipid content. Transformants overproducing either an endogenous (NoGPAT) or a heterologous (Acutodesmus obliquus GPAT) GPAT enzyme targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum had up to 42% and 51% increased non-polar lipid contents, respectively, compared to the wild type. Biomass productivities of transformant strains were not substantially impaired, resulting in lipid productivities that were increased by up to 37% and 42% for NoGPAT and AoGPAT transformants, respectively. When exposed to nutrient stress, transformants and wild type had similar lipid contents, suggesting that GPAT enzyme exerts strong flux control on lipid synthesis in N. oceanica under favorable growth conditions. NoGPAT transformants further accumulated PUFAs in non-polar lipids, reaching a total of 6.8% PUFAs per biomass, an increase of 24% relative to the wild type. Overall, our results indicate that GPAT is an interesting target for engineering of lipid metabolism in microalgae, in order to improve non-polar lipid and PUFAs accumulation in microalgae.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the brain and spinal cord resulting in physical and cognitive impairment in young adults. It is hypothesized that a disrupted bacterial and viral gut microbiota is a part of the pathogenesis mediating disease impact through an altered gut microbiota-brain axis. The aim of this study is to explore the characteristics of gut microbiota in multiple sclerosis and to associate it with disease variables, as the etiology of the disease remains only partially known.

## Circadian Rhythms and Melatonin Metabolism in Patients With Disorders of Gut-Brain Interactions.
 01.04.2022, _S Fowler, EC Hoedt, NJ Talley, S Keely, GL Burns_


Circadian rhythms are cyclic patterns of physiological, behavioural and molecular events that occur over a 24-h period. They are controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's master pacemaker which governs peripheral clocks and melatonin release. While circadian systems are endogenous, there are external factors that synchronise the SCN to the ambient environment including light/dark cycles, fasting/fed state, temperature and physical activity. Circadian rhythms also provide internal temporal organisation which ensures that any internal changes that take place are centrally coordinated. Melatonin synchronises peripheral clocks to the external time and circadian rhythms are regulated by gene expression to control physiological function. Synchronisation of the circadian system with the external environment is vital for the health and survival of an organism and as circadian rhythms play a pivotal role in regulating GI physiology, disruption may lead to gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBIs), also known as functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), are a group of diseases where patients experience reoccurring gastrointestinal symptoms which cannot be explained by obvious structural abnormalities and include functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Food timing impacts on the production of melatonin and given the correlation between food intake and symptom onset reported by patients with DGBIs, chronodisruption may be a feature of these conditions. Recent advances in immunology implicate circadian rhythms in the regulation of immune responses, and DGBI patients report fatigue and disordered sleep, suggesting circadian disruption. Further, melatonin treatment has been demonstrated to improve symptom burden in IBS patients, however, the mechanisms underlying this efficacy are unclear. Given the influence of circadian rhythms on gastrointestinal physiology and the immune system, modulation of these rhythms may be a potential therapeutic option for reducing symptom burden in these patients.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition in which women without diabetes are diagnosed with glucose intolerance during pregnancy, typically in the second or third trimester. Early diagnosis, along with a better understanding of its pathophysiology during the first trimester of pregnancy, may be effective in reducing incidence and associated short-term and long-term morbidities.

## A Systematic Review of Mixed Studies Exploring the Effects of Probiotics on Gut-Microbiome to Modulate Therapy in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.
 13.01.2023, _M Patel, LM Atluri, NA Gonzalez, N Sakhamuri, S Athiyaman, B Randhi, SD Gutlapalli, J Pu, MF Zaidi, S Khan_


Autism spectrum disorder(ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits, repetitive typical behaviors, insistence on the same routines, and communication impairments. The prevalence of ASD has increased in the past decade. While we are aware that there is no cure for ASD, attempts are being made to reduce its symptoms and improve the learning, overall growth, and well-being of ASD patients. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are frequent occurrences in patients with ASD, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Recent studies show that the microbiota-gut-brain axis is the key modulator of neuropsychiatric health. Although fecal transplants have shown positive outcomes in treating dysbiosis and symptoms of autism, lifestyle modifications such as dietary intervention will prevent and treat this disorder without causing major adverse effects. Probiotics enhance the microbiome to provide necessary metabolites, which help in gut permeability, cognitive function, and immunity. In some studies, children with increased GI symptoms have also shown increased behavioral disturbances. In this study, a systematic review of mixed studies is conducted to obtain more robust and conclusive results. We included randomized controlled studies with larger sample sizes and specifications on probiotics.

## How the geometry and mechanics of bighorn sheep horns mitigate the effects of impact and reduce the head injury criterion.
 18.01.2023, _BB Wheatley, EC Gilmore, LH Fuller, AM Drake, SW Donahue_


Male bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) participate in seasonal ramming bouts that can last for hours, yet they do not appear to suffer significant brain injury. Previous work has shown that the keratin-rich horn and boney horncore may play an important role in mitigating brain injury by reducing brain cavity accelerations through energy dissipating elastic mechanisms. However, the extent to which specific horn shapes (such as the tapered spiral of bighorn sheep) may reduce accelerations post-impact remains unclear. Thus, the goals of this work were to 1) quantify bighorn sheep horn shape, particularly the cross-sectional areal properties related to bending that largely dictate post-impact deformations, and 2) investigate the effects of different tapered horn shapes on reducing post-impact accelerations in an impact model with finite element analysis. Cross-sectional areal properties indicate bighorn sheep horns have a medial-lateral bending preference at the horn tip (p=0.006), which is likely to dissipate energy through medial-lateral horn tip oscillations after impact. Finite element modeling showed bighorn sheep native horn geometry reduced the head injury criterion (HIC15) by 48% compared to horns with cross-sections rotated by 90 degrees to have a cranial-caudal bending preference, and by 125% compared to a circular tapered spiral model. These results suggest that the tapered spiral horn shape of bighorn sheep is advantageous for dissipating energy through elastic mechanisms following an impact. These findings can be used to broadly inform the design of improved safety equipment and impact systems.

## Aging alters the cell cycle control and mitogenic signaling responses of human hematopoietic stem cells.
 18.01.2023, _CA Hammond, SW Wu, F Wang, ME MacAldaz, CJ Eaves_


Human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), like their counterparts in mice, comprise a functionally and molecularly heterogeneous population of cells throughout life that, collectively, maintain required outputs of mature blood cellsunder homeostatic conditions. An early developmental change in the HSC population in both species includes a postnatal switch from most of these cells existing in a rapidly cycling state and maintenance of a high self-renewal potential to a majority in a quiescent state with an overall reduced self-renewal potential. However, despite the well-established growth factor dependence of HSC proliferation, if and how this mechanism of HSC regulation might be affected by aging has remained poorly understood. To address this gap, we isolated highly HSC-enriched CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+CD49f+ ("CD49f+") cells from cord blood and adult bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood samples obtained from normal humans spanning 7 decades of age and then measured their functional and molecular responses to growth-factor stimulation in vitro and regenerative activity in vivo in transplanted mice. Initial experiments revealed advancing donor age was accompanied by a significant and progressively delayed proliferative response but not the altered mature cell outputs seen in normal older individuals. Importantly, subsequent dose-response analyses revealed an age-associated reduction in the growth-factor stimulated proliferation of CD49f+ cells mediated by reduced intrinsic activation of AKT and altered cell-cycle entry and progression. These findings identify a new intrinsic, pervasive, and progressive aging-related alteration in the biological and signaling mechanisms required to drive the proliferation of very primitive normal human hematopoietic cells.

## Preterm birth is associated with xenobiotics and predicted by the vaginal metabolome.
 12.01.2023, _WF Kindschuh, F Baldini, MC Liu, J Liao, Y Meydan, HH Lee, A Heinken, I Thiele, CA Thaiss, M Levy, T Korem_


Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, yet its prevention and early risk stratification are limited. Previous investigations have suggested that vaginal microbes and metabolites may be implicated in sPTB. Here we performed untargeted metabolomics on 232 second-trimester vaginal samples, 80 from pregnancies ending preterm. We find multiple associations between vaginal metabolites and subsequent preterm birth, and propose that several of these metabolites, including diethanolamine and ethyl glucoside, are exogenous. We observe associations between the metabolome and microbiome profiles previously obtained using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing, including correlations between bacteria considered suboptimal, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, and metabolites enriched in term pregnancies, such as tyramine. We investigate these associations using metabolic models. We use machine learning models to predict sPTB risk from metabolite levels, weeks to months before birth, with good accuracy (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78). These models, which we validate using two external cohorts, are more accurate than microbiome-based and maternal covariates-based models (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.55-0.59). Our results demonstrate the potential of vaginal metabolites as early biomarkers of sPTB and highlight exogenous exposures as potential risk factors for prematurity.

 12.01.2023, _LA Santorelli, T Wilkinson, R Abdulmalik, Y Rai, CJ Creevey, S Huws, J Gutierrez-Merino_


Honeybees use plant material to manufacture their own food. These insect pollinators visit flowers repeatedly to collect nectar and pollen, which are shared with other hive bees to produce honey and beebread. While producing these products, beehives accumulate a considerable number of microbes, including bacteria that derive from plants and different parts of the honeybees' body. Whether bacteria form similar communities amongst beehives, even if located in close proximity, is an ecologically important question that has been addressed in this study. Specific ecological factors such as the surrounding environment and the beekeeping methods used can shape the microbiome of the beehive as a whole, and eventually influence the health of the honeybees and their ecosystem.

## Differential carbon utilization enables co-existence of recently speciated Campylobacteraceae in the cow rumen epithelial microbiome.
 12.01.2023, _CR Strachan, XA Yu, V Neubauer, AJ Mueller, M Wagner, Q Zebeli, E Selberherr, MF Polz_


The activities of different microbes in the cow rumen have been shown to modulate the host's ability to utilize plant biomass, while the host-rumen interface has received little attention. As datasets collected worldwide have pointed to Campylobacteraceae as particularly abundant members of the rumen epithelial microbiome, we targeted this group in a subset of seven cows with meta- and isolate genome analysis. We show that the dominant Campylobacteraceae lineage has recently speciated into two populations that were structured by genome-wide selective sweeps followed by population-specific gene import and recombination. These processes led to differences in gene expression and enzyme domain composition that correspond to the ability to utilize acetate, the main carbon source for the host, at the cost of inhibition by propionate. This trade-off in competitive ability further manifests itself in differential dynamics of the two populations in vivo. By exploring population-level adaptations that otherwise remain cryptic in culture-independent analyses, our results highlight how recent evolutionary dynamics can shape key functional roles in the rumen microbiome.

## Ecological landscapes guide the assembly of optimal microbial communities.
 13.01.2023, _AB George, KS Korolev_


_Humans, Soil Microbiology, Microbiota, Microbial Consortia, Agriculture_
Assembling optimal microbial communities is key for various applications in biofuel production, agriculture, and human health. Finding the optimal community is challenging because the number of possible communities grows exponentially with the number of species, and so an exhaustive search cannot be performed even for a dozen species. A heuristic search that improves community function by adding or removing one species at a time is more practical, but it is unknown whether this strategy can discover an optimal or nearly optimal community. Using consumer-resource models with and without cross-feeding, we investigate how the efficacy of search depends on the distribution of resources, niche overlap, cross-feeding, and other aspects of community ecology. We show that search efficacy is determined by the ruggedness of the appropriately-defined ecological landscape. We identify specific ruggedness measures that are both predictive of search performance and robust to noise and low sampling density. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated using experimental data from a soil microbial community. Overall, our results establish the conditions necessary for the success of the heuristic search and provide concrete design principles for building high-performing microbial consortia.

## Over-optimism in unsupervised microbiome analysis: Insights from network learning and clustering.
 06.01.2023, _T Ullmann, S Peschel, P Finger, CL Müller, AL Boulesteix_


In recent years, unsupervised analysis of microbiome data, such as microbial network analysis and clustering, has increased in popularity. Many new statistical and computational methods have been proposed for these tasks. This multiplicity of analysis strategies poses a challenge for researchers, who are often unsure which method(s) to use and might be tempted to try different methods on their dataset to look for the "best" ones. However, if only the best results are selectively reported, this may cause over-optimism: the "best" method is overly fitted to the specific dataset, and the results might be non-replicable on validation data. Such effects will ultimately hinder research progress. Yet so far, these topics have been given little attention in the context of unsupervised microbiome analysis. In our illustrative study, we aim to quantify over-optimism effects in this context. We model the approach of a hypothetical microbiome researcher who undertakes four unsupervised research tasks: clustering of bacterial genera, hub detection in microbial networks, differential microbial network analysis, and clustering of samples. While these tasks are unsupervised, the researcher might still have certain expectations as to what constitutes interesting results. We translate these expectations into concrete evaluation criteria that the hypothetical researcher might want to optimize. We then randomly split an exemplary dataset from the American Gut Project into discovery and validation sets multiple times. For each research task, multiple method combinations (e.g., methods for data normalization, network generation, and/or clustering) are tried on the discovery data, and the combination that yields the best result according to the evaluation criterion is chosen. While the hypothetical researcher might only report this result, we also apply the "best" method combination to the validation dataset. The results are then compared between discovery and validation data. In all four research tasks, there are notable over-optimism effects; the results on the validation data set are worse compared to the discovery data, averaged over multiple random splits into discovery/validation data. Our study thus highlights the importance of validation and replication in microbiome analysis to obtain reliable results and demonstrates that the issue of over-optimism goes beyond the context of statistical testing and fishing for significance.

_Reproducibility of Results, Information Storage and Retrieval_
With an increasing amount of biological data available publicly, there is a need for a guide on how to successfully download and use this data. The 10 simple rules for using public biological data are: (1) use public data purposefully in your research; (2) evaluate data for your use case; (3) check data reuse requirements and embargoes; (4) be aware of ethics for data reuse; (5) plan for data storage and compute requirements; (6) know what you are downloading; (7) download programmatically and verify integrity; (8) properly cite data; (9) make reprocessed data and models Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) and share; and (10) make pipelines and code FAIR and share. These rules are intended as a guide for researchers wanting to make use of available data and to increase data reuse and reproducibility.
