Microbiota play critical roles in regulating colitis and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is unclear how the microbiota generate protective immunity against these disease states. Here, we find that loss of the innate and adaptive immune signaling molecule, TAK1, in myeloid cells (Tak1ΔM/ΔM) yields complete resistance to chemical-induced colitis and CRC through microbiome alterations that drive protective immunity. Tak1ΔM/ΔM mice exhibit altered microbiota that are critical for resistance, with antibiotic-mediated disruption ablating protection and Tak1ΔM/ΔM microbiota transfer conferring protection against colitis or CRC. The altered microbiota of Tak1ΔM/ΔM mice promote IL-1β and IL-6 signaling pathways, which are required for induction of protective intestinal Th17 cells and resistance. Specifically, Odoribacter splanchnicus is abundant in Tak1ΔM/ΔM mice and sufficient to induce intestinal Th17 cell development and confer resistance against colitis and CRC in wild-type mice. These findings identify specific microbiota strains and immune mechanisms that protect against colitis and CRC.

## Impact of Maternal Nutritional Supplementation during Pregnancy and Lactation on the Infant Gut or Breastmilk Microbiota: A Systematic Review.
 26.04.2021, _AZ Zaidi, SE Moore, SG Okala_


Recent evidence indicates that maternal dietary intake, including dietary supplements, during pregnancy and lactation may alter the infant gut or breastmilk microbiota, with implications for health outcomes in both the mother and infant. To review the effects of maternal nutritional supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the infant gut or breastmilk microbiota a systematic literature search was conducted. A total of 967 studies published until February 2020 were found, 31 were eligible and 29 randomized control trials were included in the qualitative synthesis. There were 23 studies that investigated the effects of probiotic supplementation, with the remaining studies investigating vitamin D, prebiotics or lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS). The effects of maternal nutritional supplementation on the infant gut microbiota or breastmilk microbiota were examined in 21 and 12 studies, respectively. Maternal probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and lactation generally resulted in the probiotic colonization of the infant gut microbiota, and although most studies also reported alterations in the infant gut bacterial loads, there was limited evidence of effects on bacterial diversity. The data available show that maternal probiotic supplementation during pregnancy or lactation results in probiotic colonization of the breastmilk microbiota. There were no observed effects between probiotic supplementation and breastmilk bacterial counts of healthy women, however, administration of Lactobacillus probiotic to nursing women affected by mastitis was associated with significant reductions in breastmilk Staphylococcal loads. Maternal LNS supplementation during pregnancy and lactation increased bacterial diversity in the infant gut, whilst vitamin D and prebiotic supplementation did not alter either infant gut bacterial diversity or counts. Heterogeneity in study design precludes any firm conclusions on the effects of maternal nutritional supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the infant gut or breastmilk microbiota, warranting further research.

## Impacts of radiation exposure on the bacterial and fungal microbiome of small mammals in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.

Environmental impacts of the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident are much debated, but the effects of radiation on host microbiomes have received little attention to date. We present the first analysis of small mammal gut microbiome from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in relation to total absorbed dose rate and including caecum as well as faeces sample. We provide novel evidence that host species determines fungal community composition, and that associations between microbiome (both bacterial and fungal) communities and radiation exposure varies between host species. Using ambient versus total weighted absorbed dose rates in analyses produced different results, with the latter more robust for interpreting microbiome changes at the individual level. We found considerable variation between results for faecal and gut samples of bank voles, suggesting faecal samples are not an accurate indicator of gut composition. Associations between radiation exposure and microbiome composition of gut samples were not robust against geographical variation, although we identified families of bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Muribaculaceae) and fungi (Steccherinaceae and Strophariaceae) in the guts of bank voles that may serve as biomarkers of radiation exposure. Further studies considering a range of small mammal species are needed to establish the robustness of these potential biomarkers.
