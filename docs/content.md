## Strategizing the human microbiome for small molecules: approaches and perspectives.
 26.11.2022, _A Hussain, U Patwekar, DS Mongad, YS Shouche_


Studies of the human microbiome are providing a deeper understanding of its significance to human health {AuQ: Edit OK?}, and increasing evidence links the microbiota with several diseases. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms involved in human-microbe interactions are mostly undefined. The genomic potential of the human microbiome to biosynthesize distinct molecules outmatches its known chemical space, and small-molecule discovery in this context remains in its infancy. The profiling of {AuQ: Edit OK?} microbiome-derived small molecules and their contextualization through cause-effect mechanistic studies may provide a better understanding of host-microbe interactions, guide new therapeutic interventions, and modulate microbiome-based therapies. This review describes the advances, approaches, and allied challenges in mining new microbial scaffolds from the human microbiome using genomic, microbe cultivation {AuQ: Edit OK?}, and chemical analytic platforms. In the future, the complete biological characterization of a single microbe-derived molecule that has a specific therapeutic application could resolve the current limitations of microbiota-modulating therapies.

## Hypomagnetic Field Exposure Affecting Gut Microbiota, Reactive Oxygen Species Levels, and Colonic Cell Proliferation in Mice.
 26.11.2022, _A Zhan, Y Luo, H Qin, W Lin, L Tian_


The gut microbiota has been considered one of the key factors in host health, which is influenced by many environmental factors. The geomagnetic field (GMF) represents one of the important environmental conditions for living organisms. Previous studies have shown that the elimination of GMF, the so-called hypomagnetic field (HMF), could affect the physiological functions and resistance to antibiotics of some microorganisms. However, whether long-term HMF exposure could alter the gut microbiota to some extent in mammals remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term (8- and 12-week) HMF exposure on the gut microbiota in C57BL/6J mice. Our results clearly showed that 8-week HMF significantly affected the diversity and function of the mouse gut microbiota. Compared with the GMF group, the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids tended to decrease in the HMF group. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that HMF promoted colonic cell proliferation, concomitant with an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo finding that long-term HMF exposure could affect the mouse gut microbiota, ROS levels, and colonic cell proliferation in the colon. Moreover, the changes in gut microbiota can be restored by returning mice to the GMF environment, thus the possible harm to the microbiota caused by HMF exposure can be alleviated.
