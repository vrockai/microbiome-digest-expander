Iron reduction and sulfate reduction are two of the major biogeochemical processes that occur in anoxic sediments. Microbes that catalyze these reactions are therefore some of the most abundant organisms in the subsurface, and some of the most important. Due to the variety of mechanisms that microbes employ to derive energy from these reactions, including the use of soluble electron shuttles, the dynamics between iron- and sulfate-reducing populations under changing biogeochemical conditions still elude complete characterization. Here, we amended experimental bioreactors comprised of freshwater aquifer sediment with ferric iron, sulfate, acetate, and the model electron shuttle AQDS (9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate) and monitored both the changing redox conditions as well as changes in the microbial community over time. The addition of the electron shuttle AQDS did increase the initial rate of FeIII reduction; however, it had little effect on the composition of the microbial community. Our results show that in both AQDS- and AQDS+ systems there was an initial dominance of organisms classified as Geobacter (a genus of dissimilatory FeIII-reducing bacteria), after which sequences classified as Desulfosporosinus (a genus of dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bacteria) came to dominate both experimental systems. Furthermore, most of the ferric iron reduction occurred under this later, ostensibly "sulfate-reducing" phase of the experiment. This calls into question the usefulness of classifying subsurface sediments by the dominant microbial process alone because of their interrelated biogeochemical consequences. To better inform models of microbially-catalyzed subsurface processes, such interactions must be more thoroughly understood under a broad range of conditions.

## Host specificity of the gut microbiome.
 28.05.2021, _EK Mallott, KR Amato_


Developing general principles of host-microorganism interactions necessitates a robust understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes that structure microbiota. Phylosymbiosis, or patterns of microbiome composition that can be predicted by host phylogeny, is a unique framework for interrogating these processes. Identifying the contexts in which phylosymbiosis does and does not occur facilitates an evaluation of the relative importance of different ecological processes in shaping the microbial community. In this Review, we summarize the prevalence of phylosymbiosis across the animal kingdom on the basis of the current literature and explore the microbial community assembly processes and related host traits that contribute to phylosymbiosis. We find that phylosymbiosis is less prevalent in taxonomically richer microbiomes and hypothesize that this pattern is a result of increased stochasticity in the assembly of complex microbial communities. We also note that despite hosting rich microbiomes, mammals commonly exhibit phylosymbiosis. We hypothesize that this pattern is a result of a unique combination of mammalian traits, including viviparous birth, lactation and the co-evolution of haemochorial placentas and the eutherian immune system, which compound to ensure deterministic microbial community assembly. Examining both the individual and the combined importance of these traits in driving phylosymbiosis provides a new framework for research in this area moving forward.

## Influence of genetic background and dietary oleic acid on gut microbiota composition in Duroc and Iberian pigs.

Phenotypic variability for productive and meat quality traits has been largely studied in Iberian pigs, especially in genetic selection and nutritional experiments. Complex interactions among genetic background, diet composition and gut microbiota hinder the correct assessment of each factor's contribution on phenotypes. In order to disentangle these interactions, we evaluated changes in gut microbiota composition comparing 48 Iberian and Duroc pigs fed diets with different energy source (standard diet with carbohydrates vs sunflower oil-enriched diet with high oleic acid content).

## Compartmentalization of bacterial and fungal microbiomes in the gut of adult honeybees.
 13.05.2021, _M Callegari, E Crotti, M Fusi, R Marasco, E Gonella, I De Noni, D Romano, S Borin, G Tsiamis, A Cherif, A Alma, D Daffonchio_


The core gut microbiome of adult honeybee comprises a set of recurring bacterial phylotypes, accompanied by lineage-specific, variable, and less abundant environmental bacterial phylotypes. Several mutual interactions and functional services to the host, including the support provided for growth, hormonal signaling, and behavior, are attributed to the core and lineage-specific taxa. By contrast, the diversity and distribution of the minor environmental phylotypes and fungal members in the gut remain overlooked. In the present study, we hypothesized that the microbial components of forager honeybees (i.e., core bacteria, minor environmental phylotypes, and fungal members) are compartmentalized along the gut portions. The diversity and distribution of such three microbial components were investigated in the context of the physico-chemical conditions of different gut compartments. We observed that changes in the distribution and abundance of microbial components in the gut are consistently compartment-specific for all the three microbial components, indicating that the ecological and physiological interactions among the host and microbiome vary with changing physico-chemical and metabolic conditions of the gut.

## Soil microbial community responses to short-term nitrogen addition in China's Horqin Sandy Land.
 20.05.2021, _N Yayi, D Yulong, L Yuqiang, W Xuyang, C Yun, W Lilong_


Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) addition has increased soil nutrient availability, thereby affecting ecosystem processes and functions in N-limited ecosystems. Long-term N addition decreases plant biodiversity, but the effects of short-term N addition on soil microbial community is poorly understood. The present study examined the impacts of short-term N addition (NH4NO3) on these factors in a sandy grassland and semi-fixed sandy land in the Horqin Sandy Land. We measured the responses of soil microbial biomass C and N; on soil β-1,4-glucosidase (BG) and β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity; and soil microflora characteristics to N additions gradient with 0 (control), 5 (N5), 10 (N10), and 15 (N15) g N m-2 yr-1. The soil microbial biomass indices, NAG activity, and soil microflora characteristics did not differ significantly among the N levels, and there was no difference at the two sites. The competition for N between plants and soil microbes was not eliminated by short-term N addition due to the low soil nutrient and moisture contents, and the relationships among the original soil microbes did not change. However, N addition increased BG activity in the N5 and N10 additions in the sandy grassland, and in the N5, N10, and N15 additions in the semi-fixed sandy land. This may be due to increased accumulation and fixation of plant litter into soils in response to N addition, leading to increased microbial demand for a C source and increased soil BG activity. Future research should explore the relationships between soil microbial community and N addition at the two sites.

## Integrating Viral Metagenomics into an Ecological Framework.
 25.05.2021, _P Sommers, A Chatterjee, A Varsani, G Trubl_


Viral metagenomics has expanded our knowledge of the ecology of uncultured viruses, within both environmental (e.g., terrestrial and aquatic) and host-associated (e.g., plants and animals, including humans) contexts. Here, we emphasize the implementation of an ecological framework in viral metagenomic studies to address questions in virology rarely considered ecological, which can change our perception of viruses and how they interact with their surroundings. An ecological framework explicitly considers diverse variants of viruses in populations that make up communities of interacting viruses, with ecosystem-level effects. It provides a structure for the study of the diversity, distributions, dynamics, and interactions of viruses with one another, hosts, and the ecosystem, including interactions with abiotic factors. An ecological framework in viral metagenomics stands poised to broadly expand our knowledge in basic and applied virology. We highlight specific fundamental research needs to capitalize on its potential and advance the field. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Virology, Volume 8 is September 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
