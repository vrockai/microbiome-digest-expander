Culture-independent metagenomic studies have revolutionized our understanding of the gut microbiota. However, the lack of full genomes from cultured species is still a limitation for in-depth studies of the gut microbiota. Here we present a substantially expanded version of our Cultivated Genome Reference (CGR), termed CGR2, providing 3324 high-quality draft genomes from isolates selected from a large-scale cultivation of bacterial isolates from fecal samples of healthy Chinese individuals. The CGR2 classifies 527 species (179 previously unidentified species) from 8 phyla, and uncovers a genomic and functional diversity of Collinsella aerofaciens. The CGR2 genomes match 126 metagenome-assembled genomes without cultured representatives in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection and harbor 3767 unidentified secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, providing a source of natural compounds with pharmaceutical potentials. We uncover accurate phage-bacterium linkages providing information on the evolutionary characteristics of interaction between bacteriophages and bacteria at the strain level.

Acute lung injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a diffuse lung inflammation that commonly evolves into acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. The lung microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Corisin, a proapoptotic peptide derived from the lung microbiota, plays a role in acute lung injury and acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis. Preventive therapeutic intervention with a monoclonal anticorisin antibody inhibits acute lung injury in mice. However, whether inhibition of corisin with the antibody ameliorates established acute lung injury is unknown. Here, the therapeutic effectiveness of the anticorisin antibody in already established acute lung injury in mice was assessed. Lipopolysaccharide was used to induce acute lung injury in mice. After causing acute lung injury, the mice were treated with a neutralizing anticorisin antibody. Mice treated with the antibody showed significant improvement in lung radiological and histopathological findings, decreased lung infiltration of inflammatory cells, reduced markers of lung tissue damage, and inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared to untreated mice. In addition, the mice treated with anticorisin antibody showed significantly increased expression of antiapoptotic proteins with decreased caspase-3 activation in the lungs compared to control mice treated with an irrelevant antibody. In conclusion, these observations suggest that the inhibition of corisin is a novel and promising approach for treating established acute lung injury.

Rifaximin effectively treats symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) and has shown eubiotic potential (i.e., an increase in resident microbial elements with potential beneficial effects) in other diseases. This study investigated changes in the fecal microbiome of patients with SUDD after repeated monthly treatment with rifaximin and the association of these changes with the severity of abdominal pain.

Human microbiome composition is closely tied to health, but how the host manages its microbial inhabitants remains unclear. One important, but understudied, factor is the natural host environment: mucus, which contains gel-forming glycoproteins (mucins) that display hundreds of glycan structures with potential regulatory function. Leveraging a tractable culture-based system to study how mucins influence oral microbial communities, we found that mucin glycans enable the coexistence of diverse microbes, while resisting disease-associated compositional shifts. Mucins from tissues with unique glycosylation differentially tuned microbial composition, as did isolated mucin glycan libraries, uncovering the importance of specific glycan patterns in microbiome modulation. We found that mucins shape microbial communities in several ways: serving as nutrients to support metabolic diversity, organizing spatial structure through reduced aggregation, and possibly limiting antagonism between competing taxa. Overall, this work identifies mucin glycans as a natural host mechanism and potential therapeutic intervention to maintain healthy microbial communities.

With the increasing incidence and mortality of chronic kidney disease (CKD), targeted therapies for CKD have been explored constantly. The important role of gut microbiota on CKD has been emphasized increasingly, it is necessary to analyze the metabolic mechanism of CKD patients from the perspective of gut microbiota. In this study, bioinformatics was used to analyze the changes of gut microbiota between CKD and healthy control (HC) groups using 315 samples from NCBI database. Diversity analysis showed significant changes in evenness compared to the HC group. PCoA analysis revealed significant differences between the two groups at phylum level. In addition, the F/B ratio was higher in CKD group than in HC group, suggesting the disorder of gut microbiota, imbalance of energy absorption and the occurrence of metabolic syndrome in CKD group. The study found that compared with HC group, the abundance of bacteria associated with impaired kidney was increased in CKD group, such as Ralstonia and Porphyromonas, which were negatively associated with eGFR. PICRUSt2 was used to predict related functions and found that different pathways between the two groups were mainly related to metabolism, involving the metabolism of exogenous and endogenous substances, as well as Glycerophospholipid metabolism, which provided evidence for exploring the relationship between gut microbiota and lipid metabolism. Therefore, in subsequent studies, special attention should be paid to these bacteria and metabolic pathway, and animal experiments and metabolomics studies should be conducted explore the association between bacterial community and CKD, as well as the therapeutic effects of these microbial populations on CKD.

Exclusive breastfeeding promotes gut microbial compositions associated with lower rates of metabolic and autoimmune diseases. Its cessation is implicated in increased microbiome-metabolome discordance, suggesting a vulnerability to dietary changes. Formula supplementation is common within our low-income, ethnic-minority community. We studied exclusively breastfed (EBF) neonates' early microbiome-metabolome coupling in efforts to build foundational knowledge needed to target this inequality.

## Realising respiratory microbiomic meta-analyses: time for a standardised framework.
 24.03.2023, _D Broderick, R Marsh, D Waite, N Pillarisetti, AB Chang, MW Taylor_


_Humans, Child, Microbiota, Respiratory System_
In microbiome fields of study, meta-analyses have proven to be a valuable tool for identifying the technical drivers of variation among studies and results of investigations in several diseases, such as those of the gut and sinuses. Meta-analyses also represent a powerful and efficient approach to leverage existing scientific data to both reaffirm existing findings and generate new hypotheses within the field. However, there are currently limited data in other fields, such as the paediatric respiratory tract, where extension of original data becomes even more critical due to samples often being difficult to obtain and process for a range of both technical and ethical reasons. Performing such analyses in an evolving field comes with challenges related to data accessibility and heterogeneity. This is particularly the case in paediatric respiratory microbiomics - a field in which best microbiome-related practices are not yet firmly established, clinical heterogeneity abounds and ethical challenges can complicate sharing of patient data. Having recently conducted a large-scale, individual participant data meta-analysis of the paediatric respiratory microbiota (n = 2624 children from 20 studies), we discuss here some of the unique barriers facing these studies and open and invite a dialogue towards future opportunities.

Vulvovaginal yeast infections in pregnancy are common and can cause extensive inflammation, which could contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Symptomatic yeast infections are likely to cause more inflammation than asymptomatic. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between symptomatic and asymptomatic vulvovaginal yeast infections in pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.

## Membrane lipids from gut microbiome-associated bacteria as structural and signalling molecules.
 27.03.2023, _E Ryan, SA Joyce, DJ Clarke_


_Membrane Lipids, Escherichia coli, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Cardiolipins_
Bacteria produce an array of diverse, dynamic and often complex lipid structures, some of which function beyond their typical role in membrane structure. The model organism, E. coli, has three major membrane lipids, which are glycerophosphoglycerol (phosphatidylglycerol), glycerophosphoethanolamine (phosphatidylethanolamine) and cardiolipin. However, it is now appreciated that some bacteria have the capacity to synthesize a range of lipids, including glycerophosphocholines, glycerophosphoinositols, 'phosphorous-free' N-acyl amines, sphingolipids and plasmalogens. In recent years, some of these bacterial lipids have emerged as influential contributors to the microbe-host molecular dialogue. This review outlines our current knowledge of bacterial lipid diversity, with a focus on the membrane lipids of microbiome-associated bacteria that have documented roles as signalling molecules.

## Impact of Intermittent Fasting on the Gut Microbiota: A Systematic Review.
 23.03.2023, _T PÃ©rez-Gerdel, M Camargo, M Alvarado, JD RamÃ­rez_


Obesity often results in severe negative health consequences and represents a growing issue for global health. Reducing food intake is a crucial factor for weight loss. Intermittent fasting is a relatively new intervention that contributes to weight reduction. Considering the intimate relationship between obesity and inflammatory pathologies with gut microbiota alterations, a systematic review of the literature was herein conducted to elucidate the relationship between time-restricted food intake and gut microbiota diversity in humans. Searches are carried out in three databases (PubMed, MedLine/OVID, and Academic Search Complete) between April 2019 and April 2022. Nine studies (all with longitudinal design) were identified as eligible by presenting data about the impact of intermittent fasting schemes on gut microbiota. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increase throughout follow-ups, while 16 bacteria genera change their abundance in response to intermittent fasting. Finally, some genera associated with clinical predictors such as weight change, abdominal circumference, and metabolic variables were reported. Changes induced by fasting schemes positively impact the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota and the biomarkers described here. However, the changes previously reported have been studied in short periods and some return to their basal state after fasting intervention.

## Co-occurrence network analysis unveils the actual differential impact on the olive root microbiota by two Verticillium wilt biocontrol rhizobacteria.
 25.03.2023, _M Cardoni, AJ FernÃ¡ndez-GonzÃ¡lez, A Valverde-Corredor, M FernÃ¡ndez-LÃ³pez, J Mercado-Blanco_


Verticillium wilt of olive (VWO), caused by Verticillium dahliae Kleb, is one of the most threatening diseases affecting olive cultivation. An integrated disease management strategy is recommended for the effective control of VWO. Within this framework, the use of biological control agents (BCAs) is a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach. No studies are available on the impact that the introduction of BCAs has on the resident microbiota of olive roots. Pseudomonas simiae PICF7 and Paenibacillus polymyxa PIC73 are two BCAs effective against VWO. We examined the effects of the introduction of these BCAs on the structure, composition and co-occurrence networks of the olive (cv. Picual) root-associated microbial communities. The consequences of the subsequent inoculation with V. dahliae on BCA-treated plants were also assessed.

## Investigating the eco-evolutionary response of microbiomes to environmental change.
 25.03.2023, _JBH Martiny, AC Martiny, E Brodie, AB Chase, A RodrÃ­guez-Verdugo, KK Treseder, SD Allison_


Microorganisms are the primary engines of biogeochemical processes and foundational to the provisioning of ecosystem services to human society. Free-living microbial communities (microbiomes) and their functioning are now known to be highly sensitive to environmental change. Given microorganisms' capacity for rapid evolution, evolutionary processes could play a role in this response. Currently, however, few models of biogeochemical processes explicitly consider how microbial evolution will affect biogeochemical responses to environmental change. Here, we propose a conceptual framework for explicitly integrating evolution into microbiome-functioning relationships. We consider how microbiomes respond simultaneously to environmental change via four interrelated processes that affect overall microbiome functioning (physiological acclimation, demography, dispersal and evolution). Recent evidence in both the laboratory and the field suggests that ecological and evolutionary dynamics occur simultaneously within microbiomes; however, the implications for biogeochemistry under environmental change will depend on the timescales over which these processes contribute to a microbiome's response. Over the long term, evolution may play an increasingly important role for microbially driven biogeochemical responses to environmental change, particularly to conditions without recent historical precedent.

Sequencing has been widely used to study the composition of the oral microbiome present in various health conditions. The extent of the coverage of the 16S rRNA gene primers employed for this purpose has not, however, been evaluated in silico using oral-specific databases. This paper analyses these primers using two databases containing 16S rRNA sequences from bacteria and archaea found in the human mouth and describes some of the best primers for each domain.

Recent studies revealed that gut microbiota modulates the response to cancer immunotherapy and fecal microbiota transplantation has clinical benefits in melanoma patients during treatment. Understanding how microbiota affects individual responses is crucial for precision oncology. However, it is challenging to identify key microbial taxa with limited data as statistical and machine learning models often lose their generalizability. In this study, DeepGeni, a deep generalized interpretable autoencoder, is proposed to improve the generalizability and interpretability of microbiome profiles by augmenting data and by introducing interpretable links in the autoencoder. DeepGeni-based machine learning classifier outperforms state-of-the-art classifier in the microbiome-driven prediction of responsiveness of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Moreover, the interpretable links of DeepGeni elucidate the most informative microbiota associated with cancer immunotherapy response. DeepGeni not only improves microbiome-driven prediction of immune checkpoint inhibitor responsiveness but also suggests potential microbial targets for fecal microbiota transplant or probiotics improving the outcome of cancer immunotherapy.

## Flex Meta-Storms elucidates the microbiome local beta-diversity under specific phenotypes.
 22.03.2023, _M Zhang, W Zhang, Y Chen, J Zhao, S Wu, X Su_


Beta-diversity quantitatively measures the difference among microbial communities, thus enlightening the association between microbiome composition and environment properties or host phenotypes. The beta-diversity analysis mainly relies on distances among microbiomes that are calculated by all microbial features. However, in some cases, only a small fraction of members in a community plays crucial roles. Such tiny proportion is insufficient to alter the overall distance, which is always missed by end-to-end comparison. On the other hand, beta-diversity pattern can also be interfered due to the data sparsity when only focusing on non-abundant microbes.
