Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been identified as a potentially promising therapeutic target in acute pancreatitis (AP). However, the role of intestinal TLR4 in AP and AP-associated gut injury remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between intestinal TLR4 and gut microbiota during AP. A mouse AP model was establish by intraperitoneal injection of L-arginine. Pancreatic injury and intestinal barrier function were evaluated in wild-type and intestinal epithelial TLR4 knockout (TLR4ΔIEC) mice. Gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Quadruple antibiotics were applied to induce microbiota-depleted mice. Differentially expressed genes in gut were detected by RNA sequencing. L. reuteri treatment was carried out in vivo and vitro study. Compared with wild-type mice, AP and AP-associated gut injury were exacerbated in TLR4ΔIEC mice in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus and number of Paneth cells remarkably decreased in TLR4ΔIEC mice. The KEGG pathway analysis derived from RNA sequencing suggested that genes affected by intestinal TLR4 deletion were related to the activation of nod-like receptor pathway. Furthermore, L. reuteri treatment could significantly improve the pancreatic and intestinal injury in TLR4ΔIEC mice through promoting Paneth cells in a NOD2-dependent manner. Loss of intestinal epithelial TLR4 exacerbated pancreatic and intestinal damage during AP, which might be attributed to the gut microbiota dysbiosis especially the exhausted Lactobacillus. L. reuteri might maintain intestinal homeostasis and alleviate AP via Paneth cells modulation.Abbreviations: AP Acute pancreatitis, TLR4 Toll-like receptor 4, IL-1β Interleukin-1β, IL-6 Interleukin-6, TNF-α Tumor necrosis factor-α, SIRS Systematic inflammatory response syndrome, LPS Lipopolysaccharides, SPF Specific pathogen-free, ZO-1 Zonula occludens-1, CON Control, H&amp;E Hematoxylin and eosin, FISH Fluorescence in situ hybridization, DAPI 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, PCoA Principal co-ordinates analysis, SCFA Short chain fatty acid, LEfSe Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size, ANOVA Analysis of variance, F/B Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, PCA Principal component analysis, NOD2 Nod-like receptor 2, ABX antibiotics, PCNA proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

## A biosynthetic pathway for the selective sulfonation of steroidal metabolites by human gut bacteria.

Members of the human gut microbiome enzymatically process many bioactive molecules in the gastrointestinal tract. Most gut bacterial modifications characterized so far are hydrolytic or reductive in nature. Here we report that abundant human gut bacteria from the phylum Bacteroidetes perform conjugative modifications by selectively sulfonating steroidal metabolites. While sulfonation is a ubiquitous biochemical modification, this activity has not yet been characterized in gut microbes. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we identify a widespread biosynthetic gene cluster that encodes both a sulfotransferase (BtSULT, BT0416) and enzymes that synthesize the sulfonate donor adenosine 3'-phosphate-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), including an APS kinase (CysC, BT0413) and an ATP sulfurylase (CysD and CysN, BT0414-BT0415). BtSULT selectively sulfonates steroidal metabolites with a flat A/B ring fusion, including cholesterol. Germ-free mice monocolonized with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ΔBT0416 exhibited reduced gastrointestinal levels of cholesterol sulfate (Ch-S) compared with wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron-colonized mice. The presence of BtSULT and BtSULT homologues in bacteria inhibited leucocyte migration in vitro and in vivo, and abundances of cluster genes were significantly reduced in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Together, these data provide a mechanism by which gut bacteria sulfonate steroidal metabolites and suggest that these compounds can modulate immune cell trafficking in the host.

## Altered gut microbiota patterns in COVID-19: Markers for inflammation and disease severity.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection leads to a severe respiratory illness and alters the gut microbiota, which dynamically interacts with the human immune system. Microbiota alterations include decreased levels of beneficial bacteria and augmentation of opportunistic pathogens. Here, we describe critical factors affecting the microbiota in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. These include, such as gut microbiota imbalance and gastrointestinal symptoms, the pattern of altered gut microbiota composition in COVID-19 patients, and crosstalk between the microbiome and the gut-lung axis/gut-brain-lung axis. Moreover, we have illustrated the hypoxia state in COVID-19 associated gut microbiota alteration. The role of ACE2 in the digestive system, and control of its expression using the gut microbiota is discussed, highlighting the interactions between the lungs, the gut, and the brain during COVID-19 infection. Similarly, we address the gut microbiota in elderly or co-morbid patients as well as gut microbiota dysbiosis of in severe COVID-19. Several clinical trials to understand the role of probiotics in COVID-19 patients are listed in this review. Augmented inflammation is one of the major driving forces for COVID-19 symptoms and gut microbiome disruption and is associated with disease severity. However, understanding the role of the gut microbiota in immune modulation during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help improve therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment.

## Characterization of interactions of dietary cholesterol with the murine and human gut microbiome.

Consumption of dietary lipids, such as cholesterol, modulates the gut microbiome with consequences for host health through the production of microbiome-derived metabolites. Despite the implications for host metabolism, a limited number of specific interactions of the gut microbiome with diet-derived lipids have been characterized. This is partially because obtaining species-level resolution of the responsible taxa can be challenging and additional approaches are needed to identify health-relevant metabolites produced from cholesterol-microbiome interactions. Here we performed bio-orthogonal labelling sort sequence spectrometry, a click chemistry based workflow, to profile cholesterol-specific host-microbe interactions. Mice were exposed to an alkyne-functionalized variant of cholesterol and 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing of faecal samples identified diet-derived cholesterol-interacting microbes from the genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus and Parabacteroides. Shotgun metagenomic analysis provided species-level resolution of diet-derived cholesterol-interacting microbes with enrichment of bile acid-like and sulfotransferase-like activities. Using untargeted metabolomics, we identify that cholesterol is converted to cholesterol sulfate in a Bacteroides-specific manner via the enzyme BT_0416. Mice monocolonized with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron lacking Bt_0416 showed altered host cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate compared with wild-type mice, identifying a previously uncharacterized microbiome-transformation of cholesterol and a mechanism for microbiome-dependent contributions to host phenotype. Moreover, identification of a cholesterol-responsive sulfotransferase in Bacteroides suggests diet-dependent mechanisms for altering microbiome-specific cholesterol metabolism. Overall, our work identifies numerous cholesterol-interacting microbes with implications for more precise microbiome-conscious regulation of host cholesterol homeostasis.

## Gut-derived bacterial flagellin induces beta-cell inflammation and dysfunction.

Hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are caused by failure of pancreatic beta cells. The role of the gut microbiota in T2D has been studied, but causal links remain enigmatic. Obese individuals with or without T2D were included from two independent Dutch cohorts. Human data were translated in vitro and in vivo by using pancreatic islets from C57BL6/J mice and by injecting flagellin into obese mice. Flagellin is part of the bacterial locomotor appendage flagellum, present in gut bacteria including Enterobacteriaceae, which we show to be more abundant in the gut of individuals with T2D. Subsequently, flagellin induces a pro-inflammatory response in pancreatic islets mediated by the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-5 expressed on resident islet macrophages. This inflammatory response is associated with beta-cell dysfunction, characterized by reduced insulin gene expression, impaired proinsulin processing and stress-induced insulin hypersecretion in vitro and in vivo in mice. We postulate that increased systemically disseminated flagellin in T2D is a contributing factor to beta-cell failure in time and represents a novel therapeutic target.
