_Humans, Isometric Contraction, Muscle Stretching Exercises, Male, Adult, Muscle Strength, Range of Motion, Articular, Middle Aged, Muscle, Skeletal, Female_
Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump.

Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease characterized by loss of pigmentation in the skin. It affects 0.4 to 2% of the global population, but the factors that trigger autoimmunity remain elusive. Previous work on several immune-mediated dermatological disorders has illuminated the substantial roles of the gut microbiome in disease pathogenesis. Here, we examined the gut microbiome composition in a cohort of vitiligo patients and healthy controls from India, including patients with a family history of the disease.

## Design and reporting of prebiotic and probiotic clinical trials in the context of diet and the gut microbiome.
 05.11.2024, _K Whelan, M Alexander, C Gaiani, G Lunken, A Holmes, HM Staudacher, S Theis, ML Marco_


_Probiotics, Prebiotics, Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Diet, Clinical Trials as Topic, Research Design_
Diet is a major determinant of the gastrointestinal microbiome composition and function, yet our understanding of how it impacts the efficacy of prebiotics and probiotics is limited. Here we examine current evidence of dietary influence on prebiotic and probiotic efficacy in human studies, including potential mechanisms. We propose that habitual diet be included as a variable in prebiotic and probiotic intervention studies. This recommendation is based on the potential mechanisms via which diet can affect study outcomes, either directly or through the gut microbiome. We consider the challenges and opportunities of dietary assessment in this context. Lastly, we provide recommendations for the design, conduct and reporting of human clinical trials of prebiotics and probiotics (and other biotic interventions) to account for any effect of diet and nutrition.

## Gut and oral microbial compositional differences in women with breast cancer, women with ductal carcinoma in situ, and healthy women.
 29.10.2024, _E McCune, A Sharma, B Johnson, T O'Meara, S Theiner, M Campos, D Heditsian, S Brain, JA Gilbert, L Esserman, MJ Campbell_


This study characterized and compared the fecal and oral microbiota from women with early-stage breast cancer (BC), women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and healthy women. Fecal and oral samples were collected from newly diagnosed patients prior to any therapy and characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing. Measures of gut microbial alpha diversity were significantly lower in the BC vs healthy cohort. Beta diversity differed significantly between the BC or DCIS and healthy groups, and several differentially abundant taxa were identified. Clustering (non-negative matrix factorization) of the gut microbiota identified five bacterial guilds dominated by Prevotella, Enterobacteriaceae, Akkermansia, Clostridiales, or Bacteroides. The Bacteroides and Enterobacteriaceae guilds were significantly more abundant in the BC cohort compared to healthy controls, whereas the Clostridiales guild was more abundant in the healthy group. Finally, prediction of functional pathways identified 23 pathways that differed between the BC and healthy gut microbiota including lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, lipid metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. In contrast to the gut microbiomes, there were no significant differences in alpha or beta diversity in the oral microbiomes, and very few differentially abundant taxa were observed. Non-negative matrix factorization analysis of the oral microbiota samples identified seven guilds dominated by Veillonella, Prevotella, Gemellaceae, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Propionibacterium, and Streptococcus; however, none of these guilds were differentially associated with the different cohorts. Our results suggest that alterations in the gut microbiota may provide the basis for interventions targeting the gut microbiome to improve treatment outcomes and long-term prognosis.

## Gut microbiota regulates stress responsivity via the circadian system.
 06.11.2024, _GSS Tofani, SJ Leigh, CE Gheorghe, TFS Bastiaanssen, L Wilmes, P Sen, G Clarke, JF Cryan_


Stress and circadian systems are interconnected through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to maintain responses to external stimuli. Yet, the mechanisms of how such signals are orchestrated remain unknown. Here, we uncover the gut microbiota as a regulator of HPA-axis rhythmicity. Microbial depletion disturbs the brain transcriptome and metabolome in stress-responding pathways in the hippocampus and amygdala across the day. This is coupled with a dysregulation of the circadian pacemaker in the brain that results in perturbed glucocorticoid rhythmicity. The resulting hyper-activation of the HPA axis at the sleep/wake transition drives time-of-day-specific impairments of the stress response and stress-sensitive behaviors. Finally, microbiota transplantation confirmed that diurnal oscillations of gut microbes underlie altered glucocorticoid secretion and that L. reuteri is a candidate strain for such effects. Our data offer compelling evidence that the microbiota regulates stress responsiveness in a circadian manner and is necessary to respond adaptively to stressors throughout the day.

Periodontitis, a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease, offers insights into the broader landscape of chronic inflammatory conditions. The progression and treatment outcomes of periodontitis are closely related to the oral microbiota's composition. Adjunctive systemic Amoxicillin 500 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg, often prescribed thrice daily for 7 days to enhance periodontal therapy's efficacy, have lasting effects on the oral microbiome. However, the precise mechanism through which the oral microbiome influences clinical outcomes in periodontitis patients remains debated. This investigation explores the pivotal role of the oral microbiome's composition in mediating the outcomes of adjunctive systemic antibiotic treatment.

Vaginitis is a prevalent clinical disorder associated with several adverse health consequences, prompting women to seek medical care. In this study we evaluate the Vaginal Panel Real-Time PCR kit (qPCR test) against routinely used diagnostics for detection of bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomoniasis. A total of 1011 vaginal swab specimens were analyzed. The routinely diagnostic methods for BV was Gram stain-based Nugent score. VVC presence was detected by culture, and Candida species were identified using MALDI-TOF MS. Trichomonas vaginalis was identified by culture in a selective medium. Molecular analyses were conducted on the MagXtract® 3200 System and analyzed using the CFX96™ Real-Time PCR Detection System. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the qPCR test compared to the reference method for BV diagnosis was 93.1%, 88.8%, 90.1% and 92.2%, respectively, with a Kappa value of 0.82. For Candida species, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 96.0%, 98.4%, 95.3%, and 98.7%, respectively. The qPCR test detected 32 additional positive samples for Candida not reported by the routinely used diagnostics. For trichomoniasis, the qPCR test identified T. vaginalis in fifteen specimens, despite no microscopic detection in cultured specimens. Our results demonstrate that the Vaginal Panel Real-Time PCR kit shows optimal concordance with routinely used diagnostics for diagnosing vaginitis. Furthermore, enhancing detection of T. vaginalis. However, further validation studies are necessary to confirm its full diagnostic accuracy. The use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) provides rapid and accurate diagnosis, crucial for early detection and treatment of vaginitis.

## Novel fermentations integrate traditional practice and rational design of fermented-food microbiomes.
 05.11.2024, _D Arrigan, CI Kothe, A Oliverio, JD Evans, BE Wolfe_


_Fermented Foods, Fermentation, Microbiota, Food Microbiology, Humans_
Fermented foods and beverages have been produced around the world for millennia, providing humans with a range of gastronomic, cultural, health, and scientific benefits. Building on these traditional forms, a convergence of factors, including culinary innovation, globalization, shifts in consumer preferences, and advances in microbiome sciences, has led to the emergence of so-called 'novel fermentations'. In this review, we define novel fermentation as the confluence of traditional food practices and rational microbiome design. Using principles of microbial ecology and evolution, we develop a microbiological framework that outlines several strategies for producing and characterizing novel fermentations, including switching substrates, engrafting target species, assembling whole-community chimeras, and generating novel phenotypes. A subsequent analysis of existing traditional ferments points to gaps in 'fermentation space' where novel ferments could potentially be produced using new combinations of microbes and food substrates. We highlight some important safety and sociocultural issues presented by the repurposing and modification of microbes from traditional ferments that fermented-food producers and microbiologists need to address.
