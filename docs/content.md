The vast majority of microorganisms on Earth reside in often-inseparable environment-specific communities-microbiomes. Meta-genomic/-transcriptomic sequencing could reveal the otherwise inaccessible functionality of microbiomes. However, existing analytical approaches focus on attributing sequencing reads to known genes/genomes, often failing to make maximal use of available data. We created faser (functional annotation of sequencing reads), an algorithm that is optimized to map reads to molecular functions encoded by the read-correspondent genes. The mi-faser microbiome analysis pipeline, combining faser with our manually curated reference database of protein functions, accurately annotates microbiome molecular functionality. mi-faser's minutes-per-microbiome processing speed is significantly faster than that of other methods, allowing for large scale comparisons. Microbiome function vectors can be compared between different conditions to highlight environment-specific and/or time-dependent changes in functionality. Here, we identified previously unseen oil degradation-specific functions in BP oil-spill data, as well as functional signatures of individual-specific gut microbiome responses to a dietary intervention in children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Our method also revealed variability in Crohn's Disease patient microbiomes and clearly distinguished them from those of related healthy individuals. Our analysis highlighted the microbiome role in CD pathogenicity, demonstrating enrichment of patient microbiomes in functions that promote inflammation and that help bacteria survive it.

## Matching the Directions of Electric Fields from Triboelectric and Ferroelectric Charges in Nanogenerator Devices for Boosted Performance.
 09.04.2020, _A Šutka, K Mālnieks, L Lapčinskis, M Timusk, K Pudzs, M Rutkis_


Embedding additional ferroelectric dipoles in contacting polymer layers is known to enhance the performance of triboelectricnanogenerator (TENG) devices. However, the influence of dipoles formed between the triboelectric surface charges on two contacting ferroelectric films has been ignored in all relevant studies. We demonstrate that proper attention to the alignment of the distinct dipoles present between two contacting surfaces and in composite polymer/BaTiO3 ferroelectric films can lead to up to four times higher energy and power density output compared with cases when dipole arrangement is mismatched. For example, TENG device based on PVAc/BaTiO3 shows energy density increase from 32.4 μJ m-2 to 132.9 μJ m-2 when comparing devices with matched and mismatched dipoles. The presented strategy and understanding of resulting stronger electrostatic induction in the contacting layers enable the development of TENG devices with greatly enhanced properties.

Virophages are small viruses with double-stranded DNA genomes that replicate along with giant viruses and co-infect eukaryotic cells. Due to the paucity of virophage reference genomes, a collective understanding of the global virophage diversity, distribution, and evolution is lacking.

## Structure of the Mucosal and Stool Microbiome in Lynch Syndrome.
 09.04.2020, _Y Yan, DA Drew, A Markowitz, J Lloyd-Price, G Abu-Ali, LH Nguyen, C Tran, DC Chung, KK Gilpin, D Meixell, M Parziale, M Schuck, Z Patel, JM Richter, PB Kelsey, WS Garrett, AT Chan, ZK Stadler, C Huttenhower_


The gut microbiota has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but causal alterations preceding CRC have not been elucidated. To prospectively assess microbiome changes prior to colorectal neoplasia, we investigated samples from 100 Lynch syndrome patients using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of colon biopsies, coupled with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of feces. Colectomy and CRC history represented the largest effects on microbiome profiles. A subset of Clostridiaceae were depleted in stool corresponding with baseline adenomas, while Desulfovibrio was enriched both in stool and in mucosal biopsies. A classifier leveraging stool metatranscriptomes resulted in modest power to predict interval development of preneoplastic colonic adenoma. Predictive transcripts corresponded with a shift in flagellin contributors and oxidative metabolic microenvironment, potentially factors in local CRC pathogenesis. This suggests that the effectiveness of prospective microbiome monitoring for adenomas may be limited but supports the potential causality of these consistent, early microbial changes in colonic neoplasia.

## Systems approaches for the clinical diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile infection.
 09.04.2020, _Q Wu, TC Savidge_


Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an urgent threat to global public health. Patient susceptibility to C. difficile is highly dependent on host immune status and gut dysbiosis resulting in loss of protective microbiota consortia that prevent spore germination, pathogen colonization, and disease pathogenesis. Recent clinical studies highlight the problems of differentiating symptomatic CDI from asymptomatic C. difficile carriage in patients with diarrhea. In this review, we consider how integration of microbiome and host immune systems biology data may aid in the clinical diagnosis of CDI when validated against gold standard testing and combined with standard microbiology laboratory assays.

## Developing a new class of engineered live bacterial therapeutics to treat human diseases.
 09.04.2020, _MR Charbonneau, VM Isabella, N Li, CB Kurtz_


A complex interplay of metabolic and immunological mechanisms underlies many diseases that represent a substantial unmet medical need. There is an increasing appreciation of the role microbes play in human health and disease, and evidence is accumulating that a new class of live biotherapeutics comprised of engineered microbes could address specific mechanisms of disease. Using the tools of synthetic biology, nonpathogenic bacteria can be designed to sense and respond to environmental signals in order to consume harmful compounds and deliver therapeutic effectors. In this perspective, we describe considerations for the design and development of engineered live biotherapeutics to achieve regulatory and patient acceptance.

## Intestinal enteroids recapitulate the effects of short-chain fatty acids on the intestinal epithelium.
 02.04.2020, _SC Pearce, GJ Weber, DM van Sambeek, JW Soares, K Racicot, DT Breault_


Enteroids are cultured primary intestinal epithelial cells that recapitulate epithelial lineage development allowing for a more complex and physiologically relevant model for scientific study. The large presence of intestinal stem cells (ISC) in these enteroids allows for the study of metabolite effects on cellular processes and resulting progeny cells. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as butyrate (BUT) are bacterial metabolites produced in the gastrointestinal tract that are considered to be beneficial to host cells. Therefore, the objective was to study the effects of SCFAs on biomarkers of ISC activity, differentiation, barrier function and epithelial defense in the intestine using mouse and human enteroid models. Enteroids were treated with two concentrations of acetate (ACET), propionate (PROP), or BUT for 24 h. Enteroids treated with BUT or PROP showed a decrease in proliferation via EdU uptake relative to the controls in both mouse and human models. Gene expression of Lgr5 was shown to decrease with BUT and PROP treatments, but increased with ACET. As a result of BUT and PROP treatments, there was an increase in differentiation markers for enterocyte, Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine cells. Gene expression of antimicrobial proteins Reg3β, Reg3γ, and Defb1 were stimulated by BUT and PROP, but not by ACET which had a greater effect on expression of tight junction genes Cldn3 and Ocln in 3D enteroids. Similar results were obtained with human enteroids treated with 10 mM SCFAs and grown in either 3D or Transwell™ model cultures, although tight junctions were influenced by BUT and PROP, but not ACET in monolayer format. Furthermore, BUT and PROP treatments increased transepithelial electrical resistance after 24 h compared to ACET or control. Overall, individual SCFAs are potent stimulators of cellular gene expression, however, PROP and especially BUT show great efficacy for driving cell differentiation and gene expression.

## A combination of monosodium glutamate and high-fat and high-fructose diets increases the risk of kidney injury, gut dysbiosis and host-microbial co-metabolism.
 08.04.2020, _T Pongking, O Haonon, R Dangtakot, S Onsurathum, A Jusakul, K Intuyod, A Sangka, S Anutrakulchai, U Cha'on, S Pinlaor, P Pinlaor_


Consumption of either monosodium glutamate (MSG) or high-fat and high-fructose (HFF) diets changes the gut microbiome and hence contributes to development of several diseases. In this study, with an emphasis on kidney injury, hamsters were divided into 4 groups as follows: (1) hamsters fed with standard diet (control); (2) hamsters fed with standard diet and MSG in drinking water (MSG); (3) hamsters fed with high-fat and high-fructose diets (HFF), and (4) animals fed MSG+HFF. After 8 months, the animals were used for the study. Despite showing normal kidney function, hamsters fed with MSG+HFF exhibited signs of kidney damage as demonstrated by the highest expression levels of high-mobility group box-1 and kidney injury molecule-1 in kidney tissues, while slight changes of histopathological features in H&amp;E-stained sections and normal levels of creatinine were observed, indicating possible early stages of kidney injury. Sequencing of the microbial 16S rRNA gene revealed that animals fed with the MSG+HFF diet had a higher ratio of gut Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes along with marked changes in abundance and diversity of gut microbiome compared to hamsters fed with MSG or HFF alone. In addition, 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an elevation of urine p-cresol sulfate levels in the MSG+HFF group. These results indicate that consumption of both MSG and HFF increases the risk of kidney injury, induces gut dysbiosis and an increase in the amount of p-cresol sulfate in hamsters.

## Bacterial community composition of vermicompost-treated tomato rhizospheres.
 06.04.2020, _J Munoz-Ucros, K Panke-Buisse, J Robe_


Vermicompost application has been shown to promote plant growth, alter the rhizosphere microbiome, and suppress plant pathogens. These beneficial properties are often attributed to the activity of vermicompost-associated microorganisms. However, little is known about the microbial shifts that occur in the rhizosphere after vermicompost application. To better understand the impact of vermicompost treatments on the assembly of rhizosphere bacterial communities, 16S rDNA communities of vermicompost and rhizospheres of each peat- and soil-grown tomatoes were profiled after conventional fertigation, irrigation without additional nutrients, and addition of three different vermicompost-extracts. The full dataset consisted of 412 identified genera, of which 317 remained following stringent quality filtration. Tomato rhizosphere microbiome responses to treatments were complex and unique between peat and soil growth substrates. Direct colonization of vermicompost-origin taxa into rhizospheres was limited, with genera Photobacterium and Luteimonas colonizing peat rhizospheres, genera Truepera, Phenylobacterium, and Lysinibacillus colonizing soil rhizospheres, and genus Pelagibius appearing in both soil and peat rhizospheres. Further patterns of differential abundance and presence/absence between treatments highlight vermicompost-mediated effects on rhizosphere microbiome assembly as an interplay of rhizosphere medium, direct colonization of vermicompost-origin taxa and vermicompost-induced shifts in the rhizosphere microbial community. This exploratory analysis is intended to provide an initial look at 16S community composition of vermicompost and the effects of vermicompost treatment on the rhizosphere microbiome assembly to highlight interactions of potential merit for subsequent investigations.

## Detection of potential biodeterioration risks for tempera painting in 16th century exhibits from State Tretyakov Gallery.
 02.04.2020, _A Zhgun, D Avdanina, K Shumikhin, N Simonenko, E Lyubavskaya, I Volkov, V Ivanov_


In this study, we investigated biodeterioration of materials used in tempera painting by analyzing the structure of the microbiome in ancient tempera paintings exhibited in State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, Russia. Samples were obtained from 16th-century paintings, including a grand Russian Orthodox icon "The Church Militant" (all exhibits were without visible signs of biodeterioration), and from surrounding walls and ceilings (with vast zones of visible microbial growth). A number of microorganisms isolated from visible signs of environmental bio-damage were also detected in tempera paintings kept in temperature- and humidity-controlled conditions unfavorable for the growth of microflora. To determine the biodegrading potential of the microbiome for tempera paintings, we developed a set of mock layers from paintwork materials used in tempera painting of 16th century and their modern analogues and inoculated them with cultures containing filamentous fungi and bacteria. The susceptibility to microbial degradation of individual tempera painting materials was examined by micro-Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which enabled detection of even invisible signs of biodeterioration. The results indicate that the microorganisms isolated from paintings and surrounding areas in the museum are capable of causing significant damage of various tempera materials, among which varnishes were the most resistant; however, the addition of antiseptic (sodium pentachlorophenolate) can inhibit microbial growth on sturgeon glue.

## Microbiome and antibiotic resistome in household dust from Beijing, China.
 09.04.2020, _LJ Ding, XY Zhou, YG Zhu_


We spend ever-increasing time indoors along with urbanization; however, the geographical distribution patterns of microbiome and antibiotic resistome, and their driving forces in household environment remains poorly characterized. Here, we surveyed the bacterial and fungal communities, and the resistome in settled dust gathered from 82 homes located across Beijing, China, employing Illumina sequencing and high-throughput quantitative PCR techniques. There was no clear geographical distribution pattern in dust-related bacterial communities although a slight but significant (P &lt; 0.05) distance-decay relationship occurred in its community similarity; by contrast, a relatively distinct geographical clustering and a stronger distance-decay relationship were observed in fungal communities at the local scale. The cross-domain (bacteria versus fungi) relationships in the microbiome of the dust samples were mostly observed as robust co-occurrence correlations. The bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla, with human skin, soil and plants being potential major sources. The fungal communities largely comprised potential allergens (a median 61% of the fungal sequences), with Alternaria genus within Ascomycota phylum being the most predominant taxa. The profile of dust-related bacterial communities was mainly affected by housing factors related to occupants and houseplants, while that of fungal communities was determined by georeferenced environmental factors, particularly vascular plant diversity. Additionally, a great diversity (1.96 on average for Shannon index) and normalized abundance (2.22 copies per bacterial cell on average) of antibiotic resistance genes were detected across the dust samples, with the dominance of genes resistant to vancomycin and Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin B. The resistome profile exhibited no distinct geographical pattern, and was primarily driven by certain bacterial phyla and occupancy-related factors. Overall, we underline the significance of anthropogenic impacts and house location in structuring bacterial and fungal communities inside homes, respectively, and suggest that household dust is an overlooked reservoir for antibiotic resistance.

## A restriction enzyme reduced representation sequencing approach for low-cost, high-throughput metagenome profiling.

Microbial community profiles have been associated with a variety of traits, including methane emissions in livestock. These profiles can be difficult and expensive to obtain for thousands of samples (e.g. for accurate association of microbial profiles with traits), therefore the objective of this work was to develop a low-cost, high-throughput approach to capture the diversity of the rumen microbiome. Restriction enzyme reduced representation sequencing (RE-RRS) using ApeKI or PstI, and two bioinformatic pipelines (reference-based and reference-free) were compared to bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing using repeated samples collected two weeks apart from 118 sheep that were phenotypically extreme (60 high and 58 low) for methane emitted per kg dry matter intake (n = 236). DNA was extracted from freeze-dried rumen samples using a phenol chloroform and bead-beating protocol prior to RE-RRS. The resulting sequences were used to investigate the repeatability of the rumen microbial community profiles, the effect of laboratory and analytical method, and the relationship with methane production. The results suggested that the best method was PstI RE-RRS analyzed with the reference-free approach, which accounted for 53.3±5.9% of reads, and had repeatabilities of 0.49±0.07 and 0.50±0.07 for the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2), phenotypic correlations with methane yield of 0.43±0.06 and 0.46±0.06 for PC1 and PC2, and explained 41±8% of the variation in methane yield. These results were significantly better than for bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the same samples (p&lt;0.05) except for the correlation between PC2 and methane yield. A Sensitivity study suggested approximately 2000 samples could be sequenced in a single lane on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, meaning the current work using 118 samples/lane and future proposed 384 samples/lane are well within that threshold. With minor adaptations, our approach could be used to obtain microbial profiles from other metagenomic samples.

## Aging and the Combined effects of ADRA2B and CB1 deletions on Affective Working Memory.
 23.03.2020, _B Fairfield, N Mammarella, L Fontanella, A Sarra, M D'Aurora, L Stuppia, V Gatta_


Many studies have found that memory for affective material is better than memory for neutral information and memory for positive material compared to negative material is better in older adults. Behavioral, neurophysiological as well as single polymorphism differences have been advanced to account for these effects. Here, we aimed to examine whether the combination of two polymorphisms (ADRA2B and CB1) in older adults influences active maintenance and manipulation of emotional information in aging working memory. We examined genotype data from 207 older adults (56 double deletion carriers, 116 single deletion carriers and 35 no deletion carriers) who performed a verbal operation span-like task with positive, negative and neutral words. We found that subjects carrying both ADRA2B and CB1 variants generally remembered a higher number of words. In addition, double carriers showed positivity effects while single carriers showed more general emotional enhancement effects, especially as strings lengthened. These findings are amongst the first to suggest a haplotype account of positivity effects in older adults' memory.
