## Dynamic metabolic adaptation can promote species coexistence in competitive communities.
 07.05.2020, _L Pacciani-Mori, A Giometto, S Suweis, A Maritan_


Microbes are capable of physiologically adapting to diverse environmental conditions by differentially varying the rates at which they uptake different nutrients. In particular, microbes can switch hierarchically between different energy sources, consuming first those that ensure the highest growth rate. Experimentally, this can result in bi-phasic growth curves called "diauxic shifts" that typically arise when microbes are grown in media containing several nutrients. Despite these observations are well-known in microbiology and molecular biology, the mathematical models generally used to describe the population dynamics of microbial communities do not account for dynamic metabolic adaptation, thus implicitly assuming that microbes cannot switch dynamically from one resource to another. Here, we introduce dynamic metabolic adaptation in the framework of consumer-resource models, which are commonly used to describe competitive microbial communities, allowing each species to temporally change its preferred energy source to maximize its own relative fitness. We show that dynamic metabolic adaptation enables the community to self-organize, allowing several species to coexist even in the presence of few resources, and to respond optimally to a time-dependent environment, thus showing that dynamic metabolic adaptation could be an important mechanism for maintaining high levels of diversity even in environments with few energy sources. We show that introducing dynamic metabolic strategies in consumer-resource models is necessary for reproducing experimental growth curves of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing in the presence of two carbon sources. Even though diauxic shifts emerge naturally from the model when two resources are qualitatively very different, the model predicts that the existence of such shifts is not a prerequisite for species coexistence in competitive communities.

## Toll-Like Receptor Signaling and Immune Regulatory Lymphocytes in Periodontal Disease.
 13.05.2020, _Y Gu, X Han_


Periodontitis is known to be initiated by periodontal microbiota derived from biofilm formation. The microbial dysbiotic changes in the biofilm trigger the host immune and inflammatory responses that can be both beneficial for the protection of the host from infection, and detrimental to the host, causing tissue destruction. During this process, recognition of Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) by the host Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an essential role in the host-microbe interaction and the subsequent innate as well as adaptive responses. If persistent, the adverse interaction triggered by the host immune response to the microorganisms associated with periodontal biofilms is a direct cause of periodontal inflammation and bone loss. A large number of T and B lymphocytes are infiltrated in the diseased gingival tissues, which can secrete inflammatory mediators and activate the osteolytic pathways, promoting periodontal inflammation and bone resorption. On the other hand, there is evidence showing that immune regulatory T and B cells are present in the diseased tissue and can be induced for the enhancement of their anti-inflammatory effects. Changes and distribution of the T/B lymphocytes phenotype seem to be a key determinant of the periodontal disease outcome, as the functional activities of these cells not only shape up the overall immune response pattern, but may directly regulate the osteoimmunological balance. Therefore, interventional strategies targeting TLR signaling and immune regulatory T/B cells may be a promising approach to rebalance the immune response and alleviate bone loss in periodontal disease. In this review, we will examine the etiological role of TLR signaling and immune cell osteoclastogenic activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. More importantly, the protective effects of immune regulatory lymphocytes, particularly the activation and functional role of IL-10 expressing regulatory B cells, will be discussed.

## Oral-lung microbiome interactions in lung diseases.
 11.05.2020, _MJ Mammen, FA Scannapieco, S Sethi_


The proximity and continuity of the oral cavity and the lower respiratory tract allows the oropharyngeal microbiome to be a major determinant of the lung microbiome. In addition, host-pathogen interactions related to the oropharyngeal microbiome or its metabolites could propagate systemic inflammation or modulate host defense mechanisms that could affect other organs, including the lung. There is increasing appreciation of the pathophysiologic significance of the lung microbiome, not only in the classical infection-related diseases, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis, but also in chronic noninfectious lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we will explore the relationship of the oral microbiome with lung diseases, such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis.
