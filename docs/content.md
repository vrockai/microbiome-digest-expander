## Environmental, socioeconomic, and health factors associated with gut microbiome species and strains in isolated Honduras villages.
 05.07.2024, _SV Shridhar, F Beghini, M Alexander, A Singh, RM Juárez, IL Brito, NA Christakis_


Despite a growing interest in the gut microbiome of non-industrialized countries, data linking deeply sequenced microbiomes from such settings to diverse host phenotypes and situational factors remain uncommon. Using metagenomic data from a community-based cohort of 1,871 people from 19 isolated villages in the Mesoamerican highlands of western Honduras, we report associations between bacterial species and human phenotypes and factors. Among them, socioeconomic factors account for 51.44% of the total associations. Meta-analysis of species-level profiles across several datasets identified several species associated with body mass index, consistent with previous findings. Furthermore, the inclusion of strain-phylogenetic information modifies the overall relationship between the gut microbiome and the phenotypes, especially for some factors like household wealth (e.g., wealthier individuals harbor different strains of Eubacterium rectale). Our analysis suggests a role that gut microbiome surveillance can play in understanding broad features of individual and public health.

Schizophrenia is a severe, complex and long-term psychiatric disorder with unclear etiology. Gut microbes influence the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis. Consequently, investigations of the relationship between gut microbes and schizophrenia are warranted. This study involved 29 patients with schizophrenia and 30 age-matched normal controls. After 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed microbial diversity, composition, and function. According to 16S rRNA and metagenomic gene sequencing results, patients with schizophrenia had higher abundances of Clostridium and Megasphaera. Functional analysis showed that sphingolipid, phosphonates and phosphinates, as well as glutamine metabolism were associated with the occurrence and development of schizophrenia. Our data suggest that the gut microbiota exerts an effect on patients with schizophrenia, providing valuable insights into the potential regulation of in the context of this disorder.

The impact of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on maternal or infant microbiome trajectory remains poorly understood. Utilizing large-scale longitudinal fecal samples from 264 mother-baby dyads, we present the gut microbiome trajectory of the mothers throughout pregnancy and infants during the first year of life. GDM mothers had a distinct microbiome diversity and composition during the gestation period. GDM leaves fingerprints on the infant's gut microbiome, which are confounded by delivery mode. Further, Clostridium species positively correlate with a larger head circumference at month 12 in male offspring but not females. The gut microbiome of GDM mothers with male fetuses displays depleted gut-brain modules, including acetate synthesis I and degradation and glutamate synthesis II. The gut microbiome of female infants of GDM mothers has higher histamine degradation and dopamine degradation. Together, our integrative analysis indicates that GDM affects maternal and infant gut composition, which is associated with sexually dimorphic infant head growth.

Endometrial cancer is a multifactorial disease with inflammatory, metabolic and potentially microbial cues involved in disease pathogenesis. The endometrial cancer microbiome has been poorly characterised so far and studies have often overestimated bacterial biomass due to lack of integration of appropriate contamination controls. There is also a scarcity of evidence on the functionality of microbial microenvironments in endometrial cancer. This work addresses that knowledge gap by interrogating the genuine, contamination-free microbial signatures in the female genital tract and rectum of women with endometrial cancer and the mechanistic role of microbiome on carcinogenic processes.

## Facile hydrothermal synthesis of manganese sulfide nanoelectrocatalyst for high sensitive detection of Bisphenol A in food and eco-samples.
 24.06.2022, _M Annalakshmi, TST Balamurugan, S Kumaravel, SM Chen, JL He_


_Benzhydryl Compounds, Ecosystem, Manganese Compounds, Phenols, Sulfides_
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a renowned plasticizer, and a key component of various plastics, resins, and food packaging materials. However, BPA have been identified as an endocrine disruption compound and cause severe consequences such as infertility, diabetic, obesity, carcinoma, and possess high risk of exposure in aquatic ecosystem. To this, we crafted an ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor based on the manganese sulfide nanoparticles (MnS NPs) catalyzed electrochemical oxidation of BPA, and its eventual application in rapid screening of BPA contamination. The physiochemical characteristics and electrocatalytic performance of the MnS nanocatalyst have been well studied and utilized in the fabrication of MnS/GCE based BPA sensor. The fabricated BPA sensor has shown a broad dynamic range (20 nM-2.15 mM), lower detection limits (6.52 nM) and promising towards rapid screening of BPA contaminations in food and environmental samples under mimicked real-world conditions with excellent accuracy and precision.

## Gut microbiota-lncRNA/circRNA crosstalk: implications for different diseases.
 05.07.2024, _L Zhang, X Li, H Gao, W Chang, P Li_


The gut microbiota features an abundance of diverse microorganisms and represents an important component of human physiology and metabolic homeostasis, indicating their roles in a wide array of physiological and pathological processes in the host. Maintaining balance in the gut microbiota is critical for normal functionality as microbial dysbiosis can lead to the occurrence and development of diseases through various mechanisms. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that perform important regulatory functions for many processes. Furthermore, the gut microbiota and lncRNAs/circRNAs are known to interact in a range of both physiological and pathological activities. In this article, we review existing research relevant to the interaction between the gut microbiota and lncRNAs/circRNAs and investigate the role of their crosstalk in the pathogenesis of different diseases. Studies have shown that, the gut microbiota can target lncRNAs ENO1-IT1, BFAL1, and LINC00152 to regulate colorectal cancer development via various signaling pathways. In addition, the gut microbiota can influence mental diseases and lung tumor metastasis by modulating circRNAs such as circNF1-419, circ_0001239, circHIPK2 and mmu_circ_0000730. These findings provide a theoretical basis for disease prevention and treatment and suggest that gut microbiota-lncRNA/circRNA crosstalk has high clinical value.

The liver disorders caused by alcohol abuse are termed alcoholic-related liver disease (ALD), including alcoholic steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis alcoholic hepatitis, and alcoholic cirrhosis, posing a significant threat to human health. Currently, ALD pathogenesis has not been completely clarified, which is likely to be related to the direct damage caused by alcohol and its metabolic products, oxidative stress, gut dysbiosis, and exosomes.

## Integrating host and microbiome biology using holo-omics.
 04.07.2024, _CM Kobel, J Merkesvik, IMT Burgos, W Lai, O Øyås, PB Pope, TR Hvidsten, VTE Aho_


Holo-omics is the use of omics data to study a host and its inherent microbiomes - a biological system known as a "holobiont". A microbiome that exists in such a space often encounters habitat stability and in return provides metabolic capacities that can benefit their host. Here we present an overview of beneficial host-microbiome systems and propose and discuss several methodological frameworks that can be used to investigate the intricacies of the many as yet undefined host-microbiome interactions that influence holobiont homeostasis. While this is an emerging field, we anticipate that ongoing methodological advancements will enhance the biological resolution that is necessary to improve our understanding of host-microbiome interplay to make meaningful interpretations and biotechnological applications.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and fecal virome transplantation (FVT, sterile filtrated donor feces) have been effective in treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections, possibly through bacteriophage-mediated modulation of the gut microbiome. However, challenges like donor variability, costly screening, coupled with concerns over pathogen transfer (incl. eukaryotic viruses) with FMT or FVT hinder their wider clinical application in treating less acute diseases.

## Unearthing the power of microbes as plant microbiome for sustainable agriculture.
 06.07.2024, _A Mukherjee, BN Singh, S Kaur, M Sharma, AS Ferreira de Araújo, APA Pereira, R Morya, G Puopolo, VMM Melo, JP Verma_


In recent years, research into the complex interactions and crosstalk between plants and their associated microbiota, collectively known as the plant microbiome has revealed the pivotal role of microbial communities for promoting plant growth and health. Plants have evolved intricate relationships with a diverse array of microorganisms inhabiting their roots, leaves, and other plant tissues. This microbiota mainly includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, and viruses, forming a dynamic and interconnected network within and around the plant. Through mutualistic or cooperative interactions, these microbes contribute to various aspects of plant health and development. The direct mechanisms of the plant microbiome include the enhancement of plant growth and development through nutrient acquisition. Microbes have the ability to solubilize essential minerals, fix atmospheric nitrogen, and convert organic matter into accessible forms, thereby augmenting the nutrient pool available to the plant. Additionally, the microbiome helps plants to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen attacks and adverse environmental conditions, by priming the plant's immune responses, antagonizing phytopathogens, and improving stress tolerance. Furthermore, the plant microbiome plays a vital role in phytohormone regulation, facilitating hormonal balance within the plant. This regulation influences various growth processes, including root development, flowering, and fruiting. Microbial communities can also produce secondary metabolites, which directly or indirectly promote plant growth, development, and health. Understanding the functional potential of the plant microbiome has led to innovative agricultural practices, such as microbiome-based biofertilizers and biopesticides, which harness the power of beneficial microorganisms to enhance crop yields while reducing the dependency on chemical inputs. In the present review, we discuss and highlight research gaps regarding the plant microbiome and how the plant microbiome can be used as a source of single and synthetic bioinoculants for plant growth and health.

## Surviving the stress: Understanding the molecular basis of plant adaptations and uncovering the role of mycorrhizal association in plant abiotic stresses.
 07.07.2024, _V Sharma, DP Sharma, R Salwan_


Environmental stresses severely impair plant growth, resulting in significant crop yield and quality loss. Among various abiotic factors, salt and drought stresses are one of the major factors that affect the nutrients and water uptake by the plants, hence ultimately various physiological aspects of the plants that compromises crop yield. Continuous efforts have been made to investigate, dissect and improve plant adaptations at the molecular level in response to drought and salinity stresses. In this context, the plant beneficial microbiome presents in the rhizosphere, endosphere, and phyllosphere, also referred as second genomes of the plant is well known for its roles in plant adaptations. Exploration of beneficial interaction of fungi with host plants known as mycorrhizal association is one such special interaction that can facilitates the host plants adaptations. Mycorrhiza assist in alleviating the salinity and drought stresses of plants via redistributing the ion imbalance through translocation to different parts of the plants, as well as triggering oxidative machinery. Mycorrhiza association also regulates the level of various plant growth regulators, osmolytes and assists in acquiring minerals that are helpful in plant's adaptation against extreme environmental stresses. The current review examines the role of various plant growth regulators and plants' antioxidative systems, followed by mycorrhizal association during drought and salt stresses.

## Beyond Meta-Omics: Functional Genomics in Future Marine Microbiome Research.
 01.07.2024, _Y Chen_


When President Bill Clinton and Francis Collins, then the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, celebrated the near completion of the human genome sequence at the White House in the summer of 2000, it is unlikely that they or anyone else could have predicted the blossoming of meta-omics in the following two decades and their applications in modern human microbiome and environmental microbiome research. This transformation was enabled by the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies and sophisticated computational biology tools and bioinformatics software packages. Today, environmental meta-omics has undoubtedly revolutionized our understanding of ocean ecosystems, providing the genetic blueprint of oceanic microscopic organisms. In this review, I discuss the importance of functional genomics in future marine microbiome research and advocate a position for a gene-centric, bottom-up approach in modern oceanography. I propose that a synthesis of multidimensional approaches is required for a better understanding of the true functionality of the marine microbiome.

## Soil Metaproteomics for Microbial Community Profiling: Methodologies and Challenges.
 02.07.2024, _H Pan, R Wattiez, D Gillan_


_Soil Microbiology, Proteomics, Metagenomics, Bacteria, Microbiota, Fungi, Soil, Computational Biology_
Soil represents a complex and dynamic ecosystem, hosting a myriad of microorganisms that coexist and play vital roles in nutrient cycling and organic matter transformation. Among these microorganisms, bacteria and fungi are key members of the microbial community, profoundly influencing the fate of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon in terrestrial environments. Understanding the intricacies of soil ecosystems and the biological processes orchestrated by microbial communities necessitates a deep dive into their composition and metabolic activities. The advent of next-generation sequencing and 'omics' techniques, such as metagenomics and metaproteomics, has revolutionized our understanding of microbial ecology and the functional dynamics of soil microbial communities. Metagenomics enables the identification of microbial community composition in soil, while metaproteomics sheds light on the current biological functions performed by these communities. However, metaproteomics presents several challenges, both technical and computational. Factors such as the presence of humic acids and variations in extraction methods can influence protein yield, while the absence of high-resolution mass spectrometry and comprehensive protein databases limits the depth of protein identification. Notwithstanding these limitations, metaproteomics remains a potent tool for unraveling the intricate biological processes and functions of soil microbial communities. In this review, we delve into the methodologies and challenges of metaproteomics in soil research, covering aspects such as protein extraction, identification, and bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, we explore the applications of metaproteomics in soil bioremediation, highlighting its potential in addressing environmental challenges.

_Humans, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Metagenomics, Microbiota, Cadaver_
Microorganisms are essential in the decomposition of corpses and play a significant role in forensic science. However, previous studies have primarily focused on animal remains, specifically the gut, skin, and burial environment. Insufficient research has been conducted on the microbiota of human cadavers, especially in cases of advanced decomposition and additional tissues, resulting in a lack of relevant reference data. In this study, the microbiota of eight cadavers at different stages of decomposition were detected using 16S rRNA, metagenomic sequencing and 2bRAD-M sequencing. Nine different sites, including oral and nasal cavities, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, muscle and gut, were analysed and the efficacy of these methods was evaluated. The results showed that 16S rRNA sequencing was the most cost-effective method for the study of cadavers in the early stages of decomposition, whereas for cadaveric tissues in the late stages of decomposition, 2bRAD-M could overcome host contamination more effectively than metagenomic sequencing. This paves the way for new opportunities in data retrieval and promotes in-depth investigations into the microbiota.
