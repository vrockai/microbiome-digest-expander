Globally, stunting affects ∼150 million children under five, while wasting affects nearly 50 million. Current interventions have had limited effectiveness in ameliorating long-term sequelae of undernutrition including stunting, cognitive deficits and immune dysfunction. Disrupted development of the gut microbiota has been linked to the pathogenesis of undernutrition, providing potentially new treatment approaches.

## Tibetan Plateau grasslands might increase sequestration of microbial necromass carbon under future warming.

Microbial necromass carbon (MNC) can reflect soil carbon (C) sequestration capacity. However, changes in the reserves of MNC in response to warming in alpine grasslands across the Tibetan Plateau are currently unclear. Based on large-scale sampling and published observations, we divided eco-clusters based on dominant phylotypes, calculated their relative abundance, and found that their averaged importance to MNC was higher than most other environmental variables. With a deep learning model based on stacked autoencoder, we proved that using eco-cluster relative abundance as the input variable of the model can accurately predict the overall distribution of MNC under current and warming conditions. It implied that warming could lead to an overall increase in the MNC in grassland topsoil across the Tibetan Plateau, with an average increase of 7.49 mg/g, a 68.3% increase. Collectively, this study concludes that alpine grassland has the tendency to increase soil C sequestration capacity on the Tibetan Plateau under future warming.
