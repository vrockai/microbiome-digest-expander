The pilot clinical study presented demonstrates the possibility, safety, and effectiveness of oral microbiota transplantation from a healthy donor to a patient with neuroblastoma to prevent chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. A 6-month-old patient with a diagnosis of retroperitoneal neuroblastoma was treated according to the NB 2004 protocol. Due to the development of severe oral mucositis, it was decided to perform oral microbiota transplantation. During the next 3 chemotherapy cycles and conditioning regimen before autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT), the patient was repeatedly injected per os with donor saliva from her healthy mother. Oral microbiota transplantation was shown to effectively prevent the development of oral mucositis after chemotherapy, and only grade 1 oral mucositis developed after auto-HCT. In all loci of the oral cavity, there was a decreased abundance of bacteria from the Staphylococcaceae, Micrococcaceae, and Xanthomonadaceae families. Conversely, there was an increase in the relative abundance of Streptococcaceae and certain other bacterial taxa. In conclusion, the transplantation of maternal saliva in this patient prevented severe mucositis and was accompanied by a compositional change of the patient's oral microbiota. No adverse events due to the transplantation of maternal saliva were noted.

Despite serious health and social consequences, effective intervention strategies for habitual alcohol binge drinking are lacking. The development of novel therapeutic and preventative approaches is highly desirable. Accumulating evidence in the past several years has established associations between the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites with drinking behavior, but druggable targets and their underlying mechanism of action are understudied.

Aquaculture is an important food source worldwide. The extensive use of antibiotics in intensive large-scale farms has resulted in resistance development. Non-intensive aquaculture is another aquatic feeding model that is conducive to ecological protection and closely related to the natural environment. However, the transmission of resistomes in non-intensive aquaculture has not been well characterized. Moreover, the influence of aquaculture resistomes on human health needs to be further understood. Here, metagenomic approach was employed to identify the mobility of aquaculture resistomes and estimate the potential risks to human health.

## Genome-wide screen of genetic determinants that govern Escherichia coli growth and persistence in lake water.
 14.06.2024, _N Teteneva, A Sanches-Medeiros, V Sourjik_


Although enteric bacteria normally reside within the animal intestine, the ability to persist extraintestinally is an essential part of their overall lifestyle, and it might contribute to transmission between hosts. Despite this potential importance, few genetic determinants of extraintestinal growth and survival have been identified, even for the best-studied model, Escherichia coli. In this work, we thus used a genome-wide library of barcoded transposon insertions to systematically identify functional clusters of genes that are crucial for E. coli fitness in lake water. Our results revealed that inactivation of pathways involved in maintaining outer membrane integrity, nucleotide biosynthesis, and chemotaxis negatively affected E. coli growth or survival in this extraintestinal environment. In contrast, inactivation of another group of genes apparently benefited E. coli growth or persistence in filtered lake water, resulting in higher abundance of these mutants. This group included rpoS, which encodes the general stress response sigma factor, and genes encoding several other global transcriptional regulators and RNA chaperones, as well as several poorly annotated genes. Based on this co-enrichment, we identified these gene products as novel positive regulators of RpoS activity. We further observed that, despite their enhanced growth, E. coli mutants with inactive RpoS had reduced viability in lake water, and they were not enriched in the presence of the autochthonous microbiota. This highlights the duality of the general stress response pathway for E. coli growth outside the host.

## Root-associated Streptomyces produce galbonolides to modulate plant immunity and promote rhizosphere colonization.
 19.06.2024, _C Nicolle, D Gayrard, A Noël, M Hortala, A Amiel, S Grat, A Le Ru, G Marti, JL Pernodet, S Lautru, B Dumas, T Rey_


The rhizosphere, which serves as the primary interface between plant roots and the soil, constitutes an ecological niche for a huge diversity of microbial communities. Currently, there is little knowledge on the nature and the function of the different metabolites released by rhizospheric microbes to facilitate colonization of this highly competitive environment. Here, we demonstrate how the production of galbonolides, a group of polyene macrolides that inhibit plant and fungal inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (IPCS), empowers the rhizospheric Streptomyces strain AgN23, to thrive in the rhizosphere by triggering the plant's defence mechanisms. Metabolomic analysis of AgN23-inoculated Arabidopsis roots revealed a strong induction in the production of an indole alkaloid, camalexin, which is a major phytoalexin in Arabidopsis. By using a plant mutant compromized in camalexin synthesis, we show that camalexin production is necessary for the successful colonization of the rhizosphere by AgN23. Conversely, hindering galbonolides biosynthesis in AgN23 knock-out mutant resulted in loss of inhibition of IPCS, a deficiency in plant defence activation, notably the production of camalexin, and a strongly reduced development of the mutant bacteria in the rhizosphere. Together, our results identified galbonolides as important metabolites mediating rhizosphere colonization by Streptomyces.

## Organic fertilization co-selects genetically linked antibiotic and metal(loid) resistance genes in global soil microbiome.
 19.06.2024, _ZT Liu, RA Ma, D Zhu, KT Konstantinidis, YG Zhu, SY Zhang_

Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and metal(loid) resistance genes (MRGs) coexist in organic fertilized agroecosystems based on their correlations in abundance, yet evidence for the genetic linkage of ARG-MRGs co-selected by organic fertilization remains elusive. Here, an analysis of 511 global agricultural soil metagenomes reveals that organic fertilization correlates with a threefold increase in the number of diverse types of ARG-MRG-carrying contigs (AMCCs) in the microbiome (63 types) compared to non-organic fertilized soils (22 types). Metatranscriptomic data indicates increased expression of AMCCs under higher arsenic stress, with co-regulation of the ARG-MRG pairs. Organic fertilization heightens the coexistence of ARG-MRG in genomic elements through impacting soil properties and ARG and MRG abundances. Accordingly, a comprehensive global map was constructed to delineate the distribution of coexistent ARG-MRGs with virulence factors and mobile genes in metagenome-assembled genomes from agricultural lands. The map unveils a heightened relative abundance and potential pathogenicity risks (range of 4-6) for the spread of coexistent ARG-MRGs in Central North America, Eastern Europe, Western Asia, and Northeast China compared to other regions, which acquire a risk range of 1-3. Our findings highlight that organic fertilization co-selects genetically linked ARGs and MRGs in the global soil microbiome, and underscore the need to mitigate the spread of these co-resistant genes to safeguard public health.

## Conceptualizing soil fauna effects on labile and stabilized soil organic matter.

Fauna is highly abundant and diverse in soils worldwide, but surprisingly little is known about how it affects soil organic matter stabilization. Here, we review how the ecological strategies of a multitude of soil faunal taxa can affect the formation and persistence of labile (particulate organic matter, POM) and stabilized soil organic matter (mineral-associated organic matter, MAOM). We propose three major mechanisms - transformation, translocation, and grazing on microorganisms - by which soil fauna alters factors deemed essential in the formation of POM and MAOM, including the quantity and decomposability of organic matter, soil mineralogy, and the abundance, location, and composition of the microbial community. Determining the relevance of these mechanisms to POM and MAOM formation in cross-disciplinary studies that cover individual taxa and more complex faunal communities, and employ physical fractionation, isotopic, and microbiological approaches is essential to advance concepts, models, and policies focused on soil organic matter and effectively manage soils as carbon sinks, nutrient stores, and providers of food.

## Asgard archaeal selenoproteome reveals a roadmap for the archaea-to-eukaryote transition of selenocysteine incorporation machinery.
 19.06.2024, _B Huang, Y Xiao, Y Zhang_


Selenocysteine (Sec) is encoded by the UGA codon that normally functions as a stop signal and is specifically incorporated into selenoproteins via a unique recoding mechanism. The translational recoding of UGA as Sec is directed by an unusual RNA structure, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element. Although archaea and eukaryotes adopt a similar Sec encoding machinery, the SECIS elements have no similarities to each other with regard to sequence and structure. We analyzed more than 400 Asgard archaeal genomes to examine the occurrence of both Sec encoding system and selenoproteins in this archaeal superphylum, the closest prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes. A comprehensive map of Sec utilization trait has been generated, providing the most detailed understanding of the use of this nonstandard amino acid in Asgard archaea so far. By characterizing the selenoproteomes of all organisms, several selenoprotein-rich phyla and species were identified. Most Asgard archaeal selenoprotein genes possess eukaryotic SECIS-like structures with varying degrees of diversity. Moreover, euryarchaeal SECIS elements might originate from Asgard archaeal SECIS elements via lateral gene transfer, indicating a complex and dynamic scenario of the evolution of SECIS element within archaea. Finally, a roadmap for the transition of eukaryotic SECIS elements from archaea was proposed, and selenophosphate synthetase may serve as a potential intermediate for the generation of ancestral eukaryotic SECIS element. Our results offer new insights into a deeper understanding of the evolution of Sec insertion machinery.

## High-throughput single-cell transcriptomics of bacteria using combinatorial barcoding.
 17.06.2024, _KD Gaisser, SN Skloss, LM Brettner, L Paleologu, CM Roco, AB Rosenberg, M Hirano, RW DePaolo, G Seelig, A Kuchina_


Microbial split-pool ligation transcriptomics (microSPLiT) is a high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing method for bacteria. With four combinatorial barcoding rounds, microSPLiT can profile transcriptional states in hundreds of thousands of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in a single experiment without specialized equipment. As bacterial samples are fixed and permeabilized before barcoding, they can be collected and stored ahead of time. During the first barcoding round, the fixed and permeabilized bacteria are distributed into a 96-well plate, where their transcripts are reverse transcribed into cDNA and labeled with the first well-specific barcode inside the cells. The cells are mixed and redistributed two more times into new 96-well plates, where the second and third barcodes are appended to the cDNA via in-cell ligation reactions. Finally, the cells are mixed and divided into aliquot sub-libraries, which can be stored until future use or prepared for sequencing with the addition of a fourth barcode. It takes 4 days to generate sequencing-ready libraries, including 1 day for collection and overnight fixation of samples. The standard plate setup enables single-cell transcriptional profiling of up to 1 million bacterial cells and up to 96 samples in a single barcoding experiment, with the possibility of expansion by adding barcoding rounds. The protocol requires experience in basic molecular biology techniques, handling of bacterial samples and preparation of DNA libraries for next-generation sequencing. It can be performed by experienced undergraduate or graduate students. Data analysis requires access to computing resources, familiarity with Unix command line and basic experience with Python or R.

## SeqCode in the golden age of prokaryotic systematics.
 19.06.2024, _DJ Jiménez, AS Rosado_


The SeqCode is a new code of prokaryotic nomenclature that was developed to validate taxon names using genome sequences as type material. The present article provides an independent view about the SeqCode, highlighting its history, current status, basic features, pros and cons, and use to date. We also discuss important topics to consider for validation of novel prokaryotic taxon names using genomes as type material. Owing to significant advances in metagenomics and cultivation methods, hundreds of novel prokaryotic species are expected to be discovered in the coming years. This manuscript aims to stimulate and enrich the debate around the use of the SeqCode in the upcoming golden age of prokaryotic taxon discovery and systematics.

The recent increase in the incidence of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) coincides with the obesity epidemic in the United States. However, current mouse models do not fully replicate the combined insults of obesity, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, and alcohol. The aim of this study was to develop a new mouse model that recapitulates the robust inflammatory and fibrotic phenotype characteristic of human MetALD.
