Patients exposed to trauma often experience high rates of adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). The biological mechanisms promoting APNS are currently unknown, but the microbiota-gut-brain axis offers an avenue to understanding mechanisms as well as possibilities for intervention. Microbiome composition after trauma exposure has been poorly examined regarding neuropsychiatric outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the gut microbiomes of trauma-exposed emergency department patients who develop APNS have dysfunctional gut microbiome profiles and discover potential associated mechanisms. We performed metagenomic analysis on stool samples (n = 51) from a subset of adults enrolled in the Advancing Understanding of RecOvery afteR traumA (AURORA) study. Two-, eight- and twelve-week post-trauma outcomes for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PTSD checklist for DSM-5), normalized depression scores (PROMIS Depression Short Form 8b) and somatic symptom counts were collected. Generalized linear models were created for each outcome using microbial abundances and relevant demographics. Mixed-effect random forest machine learning models were used to identify associations between APNS outcomes and microbial features and encoded metabolic pathways from stool metagenomics. Microbial species, including Flavonifractor plautii, Ruminococcus gnavus and, Bifidobacterium species, which are prevalent commensal gut microbes, were found to be important in predicting worse APNS outcomes from microbial abundance data. Notably, through APNS outcome modeling using microbial metabolic pathways, worse APNS outcomes were highly predicted by decreased L-arginine related pathway genes and increased citrulline and ornithine pathways. Common commensal microbial species are enriched in individuals who develop APNS. More notably, we identified a biological mechanism through which the gut microbiome reduces global arginine bioavailability, a metabolic change that has also been demonstrated in the plasma of patients with PTSD.

Despite a growing recognition that the type of nutrition received by preterm infants influences their intestinal microbiome and health outcomes, the microbiota of mother's own milk (MOM), pasteurized donor human milk (PDHM), and infant formula remain poorly characterized. In our study, we found that the structure of microbial communities, bacterial diversity, and relative abundances of specific genera were significantly different between MOM, PDHM, and formula. Additionally, our results suggest that the microbiota of MOM changes as a function of time and maternal factors. Lastly, we identified three lactotypes within MOM that have distinct microbial compositions and described the maternal factors associated with them. These findings set the stage for future research aimed at advancing our knowledge of the microbiota of preterm infant nutrition and the specific influence it may have on health outcomes.

## The Potential of Meta-Proteomics and Artificial Intelligence to Establish the Next Generation of Probiotics for Personalized Healthcare.

The symbiosis of probiotic bacteria with humans has rendered various health benefits while providing nutrition and a suitable environment for their survival. However, the probiotics must survive unfavorable gut conditions to exert beneficial effects. The intrinsic resistance of probiotics to survive harsh conditions results from a myriad of proteins. Interaction of microbial proteins with the host is indispensable for modulating the gut microbiome, such as interaction with cell receptors and protective action against pathogens. The complex interplay of proteins should be unraveled by utilizing metaproteomic strategies. The contribution of probiotics to health is now widely accepted. However, due to the inconsistency of generalized probiotics, contemporary research toward precision probiotics has gained momentum for customized treatment. This review explores the application of metaproteomics and AI/ML algorithms in resolving multiomics data analysis and in silico prediction of microbial features for screening specific beneficial probiotic organisms. Implementing these integrative strategies could augment the potential of precision probiotics for personalized healthcare.

While many studies have reported that the structure of the gut and skin microbiota is driven by both species-specific and habitat-specific factors, the relative importance of host-specific versus environmental factors in wild vertebrates remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the diversity and composition of fish skin, gut, and surrounding water bacterial communities (hereafter referred to as microbiota) and assess the extent to which host habitat and phylogeny predict microbiota similarity. Skin swabs and gut samples from 334 fish belonging to 17 species were sampled in three Laurentian Great Lakes (LGLs) habitats (Detroit River, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario). We also collected and filtered water samples at the time of fish collection. We analyzed bacterial community composition using 16S metabarcoding and tested for community variation.
