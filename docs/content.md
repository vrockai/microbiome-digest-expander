Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for type 2 diabetes and is associated with changes in gut metabolites. Previous work uncovered a gut-restricted TGR5 agonist with anti-diabetic properties-cholic acid-7-sulfate (CA7S)-that is elevated following sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Here, we elucidate a microbiome-dependent pathway by which SG increases CA7S production. We show that a microbial metabolite, lithocholic acid (LCA), is increased in murine portal veins post-SG and by activating the vitamin D receptor, induces hepatic mSult2A1/hSULT2A expression to drive CA7S production. An SG-induced shift in the microbiome increases gut expression of the bile acid transporters Asbt and Ostα, which in turn facilitate selective transport of LCA across the gut epithelium. Cecal microbiota transplant from SG animals is sufficient to recreate the pathway in germ-free (GF) animals. Activation of this gut-liver pathway leads to CA7S synthesis and GLP-1 secretion, causally connecting a microbial metabolite with the improvement of diabetic phenotypes.

## The microbiota in pneumonia: From protection to predisposition.
 14.01.2021, _C Thibeault, N Suttorp, B Opitz_


Mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract and gut are physiologically colonized with their own collection of microbes, the microbiota. The normal upper respiratory tract and gut microbiota protects against pneumonia by impeding colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria and by regulating immune responses. However, antimicrobial therapy and critical care procedures perturb the microbiota, thus compromising its function and predisposing to lung infections (pneumonia). Interindividual variations and age-related alterations in the microbiota also affect vulnerability to pneumonia. We discuss how the healthy microbiota protects against pneumonia and how host factors and medical interventions alter the microbiota, thus influencing susceptibility to pneumonia.

## A philosophical perspective on the prenatal in utero microbiome debate.
 16.01.2021, _J Walter, MW Hornef_


Within the last 6 years, a research field has emerged that focuses on the characterization of microbial communities in the prenatal intrauterine environment of humans and their putative role in human health. However, there is considerable controversy around the existence of such microbial populations. The often contentious debate is primarily focused on technical aspects of the research, such as difficulties to assure aseptic sampling and to differentiate legitimate signals in the data from contamination. Although such discussions are clearly important, we feel that the problems with the prenatal microbiome field go deeper. In this commentary, we apply a philosophical framework to evaluate the foundations, experimental approaches, and interpretations used by scientists on both sides of the debate. We argue that the evidence for a "sterile womb" is based on a scientific approach that aligns well with important principles of the philosophy of science as genuine tests of the hypothesis and multiple angles of explanatory considerations were applied. In contrast, research in support of the "in utero colonization hypothesis" is solely based on descriptive verifications that do not provide explanatory insight, which weakens the evidence for a prenatal intrauterine microbiome. We propose that a reflection on philosophical principles can inform not only the debate on the prenatal intrauterine microbiome but also other disciplines that attempt to study low-biomass microbial communities.
