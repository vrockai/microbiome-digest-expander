## Culturomics-based genomics sheds light on the ecology of the new haloarchaeal genus Halosegnis.
 15.05.2020, _A Durán-Viseras, AŞ Andrei, B Vera-Gargallo, R Ghai, C Sánchez-Porro, A Ventosa_


The development of culture-independent techniques has revolutioned our understanding of microbial ecology, especially through the illustration of the vast gap between the environmentally abundant microbial diversity and that accessible through cultivation. However, culture-based approaches are not only crucial for understanding the evolutionary, metabolic and ecological milieu of microbial diversity, but also for the development of novel biotechnological applications. In this study, we used a culturomics-based approach in order to isolate novel microbial taxa from hypersaline environments (i.e. Isla Cristina and Isla Bacuta salterns in Huelva, Spain). We managed to obtain axenic cultures of four haloarchaeal strains that belong to a new haloarchaeal genus, and to obtain their genomic sequences. The phylogenomic and phylogenetic analyses (together with AAI, ANI and digital DDH indices) showed that the isolates constitute two new species, for which we propose the names Halosegnis longus sp. nov. and Halosegnis rubeus sp. nov. The genomic-based metabolic reconstructions indicated that members of this new haloarchaeal genus have photoheterotrophic aerobic lifestyle with a typical salt-in signature. 16S rRNA gene sequence reads abundance profiles and genomic recruitment analyses revealed that the Halosegnis genus has a worldwide geographical distribution, reaching high abundance (up to 8%) in habitats with intermediate salinities.

## Metagenome-assembled genomes reveal unique metabolic adaptations of a basal marine Thaumarchaeota lineage.
 14.05.2020, _L Reji, CA Francis_


Thaumarchaeota constitute an abundant and ubiquitous phylum of Archaea that play critical roles in the global nitrogen and carbon cycles. Most well-characterized members of the phylum are chemolithoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), which comprise up to 5 and 20% of the total single-celled life in soil and marine systems, respectively. Using two high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), here we describe a divergent marine thaumarchaeal clade that is devoid of the ammonia-oxidation machinery and the AOA-specific carbon-fixation pathway. Phylogenomic analyses placed these genomes within the uncultivated and largely understudied marine pSL12-like thaumarchaeal clade. The predominant mode of nutrient acquisition appears to be aerobic heterotrophy, evidenced by the presence of respiratory complexes and various organic carbon degradation pathways. Both genomes encoded several pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, as well as a form III RuBisCO. Metabolic reconstructions suggest anaplerotic CO2 assimilation mediated by RuBisCO, which may be linked to the central carbon metabolism. We conclude that these genomes represent a hitherto unrecognized evolutionary link between predominantly anaerobic basal thaumarchaeal lineages and mesophilic marine AOA, with important implications for diversification within the phylum Thaumarchaeota.

## Novel yeast taxa from the cold: description of Cryolevonia giraudoae sp. nov. and Camptobasidium gelus sp. nov.
 17.05.2020, _V de Garcia, A Trochine, J Uetake, N Bellora, D Libkind_


Twenty-one psychrophilic yeast isolates related to the Camptobasidiaceae family in the Microbotryomycetes class were obtained from ice collected from cold environments worldwide. A new psychrophilic species from the recently described genus Cryolevonia, Cryolevania giraudoae is proposed to accommodate 18 isolates from Patagonia (Argentina) and Antarctica (holotype CRUB 2086T). In addition, a new psychrophilic species in the genus Camptobasidium is described as Camptobasidium gelus sp. nov. (holotype CBS 8941T), based on three isolates from glacial ice in the Russel glacier (Greenland ice sheet) and Antarctica. The strict psychrophilic profile is the salient feature of both novel species.

## Visualizing the invisible: class excursions to ignite children's enthusiasm for microbes.
 16.05.2020, _TJ McGenity, A Gessesse, JE Hallsworth, E Garcia Cela, C Verheecke-Vaessen, F Wang, M Chavarría, MM Haggblom, S Molin, A Danchin, EJ Smid, C Lood, CS Cockell, C Whitby, SJ Liu, NP Keller, LY Stein, SR Bordenstein, R Lal, OC Nunes, L Gram, BK Singh, NS Webster, C Morris, S Sivinski, S Bindschedler, P Junier, A Antunes, BK Baxter, P Scavone, K Timmis_


We have recently argued that, because microbes have pervasive - often vital - influences on our lives, and that therefore their roles must be taken into account in many of the decisions we face, society must become microbiology-literate, through the introduction of relevant microbiology topics in school curricula (Timmis et al. 2019. Environ Microbiol 21: 1513-1528). The current coronavirus pandemic is a stark example of why microbiology literacy is such a crucial enabler of informed policy decisions, particularly those involving preparedness of public-health systems for disease outbreaks and pandemics. However, a significant barrier to attaining widespread appreciation of microbial contributions to our well-being and that of the planet is the fact that microbes are seldom visible: most people are only peripherally aware of them, except when they fall ill with an infection. And it is disease, rather than all of the positive activities mediated by microbes, that colours public perception of 'germs' and endows them with their poor image. It is imperative to render microbes visible, to give them life and form for children (and adults), and to counter prevalent misconceptions, through exposure to imagination-capturing images of microbes and examples of their beneficial outputs, accompanied by a balanced narrative. This will engender automatic mental associations between everyday information inputs, as well as visual, olfactory and tactile experiences, on the one hand, and the responsible microbes/microbial communities, on the other hand. Such associations, in turn, will promote awareness of microbes and of the many positive and vital consequences of their actions, and facilitate and encourage incorporation of such consequences into relevant decision-making processes. While teaching microbiology topics in primary and secondary school is key to this objective, a strategic programme to expose children directly and personally to natural and managed microbial processes, and the results of their actions, through carefully planned class excursions to local venues, can be instrumental in bringing microbes to life for children and, collaterally, their families. In order to encourage the embedding of microbiology-centric class excursions in current curricula, we suggest and illustrate here some possibilities relating to the topics of food (a favourite pre-occupation of most children), agriculture (together with horticulture and aquaculture), health and medicine, the environment and biotechnology. And, although not all of the microbially relevant infrastructure will be within reach of schools, there is usually access to a market, local food store, wastewater treatment plant, farm, surface water body, etc., all of which can provide opportunities to explore microbiology in action. If children sometimes consider the present to be mundane, even boring, they are usually excited with both the past and the future so, where possible, visits to local museums (the past) and research institutions advancing knowledge frontiers (the future) are strongly recommended, as is a tapping into the natural enthusiasm of local researchers to leverage the educational value of excursions and virtual excursions. Children are also fascinated by the unknown, so, paradoxically, the invisibility of microbes makes them especially fascinating objects for visualization and exploration. In outlining some of the options for microbiology excursions, providing suggestions for discussion topics and considering their educational value, we strive to extend the vistas of current class excursions and to: (i) inspire teachers and school managers to incorporate more microbiology excursions into curricula; (ii) encourage microbiologists to support school excursions and generally get involved in bringing microbes to life for children; (iii) urge leaders of organizations (biopharma, food industries, universities, etc.) to give school outreach activities a more prominent place in their mission portfolios, and (iv) convey to policymakers the benefits of providing schools with funds, materials and flexibility for educational endeavours beyond the classroom.

## Discovery of thermophilic Bacillales using reduced-representation genotyping for identification.
 14.05.2020, _B Talamantes-Becerra, J Carling, A Kilian, A Georges_


This study demonstrates the use of reduced-representation genotyping to provide preliminary identifications for thermophilic bacterial isolates. The approach combines restriction enzyme digestion and PCR with next-generation sequencing to provide thousands of short-read sequences from across the bacterial genomes. Isolates were obtained from compost, hot water systems, and artesian bores of the Great Artesian Basin. Genomic DNA was double-digested with two combinations of restriction enzymes followed by PCR amplification, using a commercial provider of DArTseq™, Diversity Arrays Technology Pty Ltd. (Canberra, Australia). The resulting fragments which formed a reduced-representation of approximately 2.3% of the genome were sequenced. The sequence tags obtained were aligned against all available RefSeq bacterial genome assemblies by BLASTn to identify the nearest reference genome.
