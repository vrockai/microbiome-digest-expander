## Postbiotic butyrate: role and its effects for being a potential drug and biomarker to pancreatic cancer.
 15.03.2024, _A Elango, VD Nesam, P Sukumar, I Lawrence, A Radhakrishnan_


_Humans, Butyrates, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Pancreatic Neoplasms_
Postbiotics are produced by microbes and have recently gained importance in the field of oncology due to their beneficial effects to the host, effectiveness against cancer cells, and their ability to suppress inflammation. In particular, butyrate dominates over all other postbiotics both in quantity and anticancer properties. Pancreatic cancer (PC), being one of the most malignant and lethal cancers, reported a decreased 5-year survival rate in less than 10% of the patients. PC causes an increased mortality rate due to its inability to be detected at an early stage but still a promising strategy for its diagnosis has not been achieved yet. It is necessary to diagnose Pancreatic cancer before the metastatic progression stage. The available blood biomarkers lack accurate and proficient diagnostic results. Postbiotic butyrate is produced by gut microbiota such as Rhuminococcus and Faecalibacterium it is involved in cell signalling pathways, autophagy, and cell cycle regulation, and reduction in butyrate concentration is associated with the occurrence of pancreatic cancer. The postbiotic butyrate is a potential biomarker that could detect PC at an early stage, before the metastatic progression stage. Thus, this review focused on the gut microbiota butyrate's role in pancreatic cancer and the immuno-suppressive environment, its effects on histone deacetylase and other immune cells, microbes in major butyrate synthesis pathways, current biomarkers in use for Pancreatic Cancer.

In this study, we aimed to understand the potential role of the gut microbiome in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We took a multi-faceted approach to investigate this relationship. Urine metabolomics were examined in individuals with AD and controls, revealing decreased formate and fumarate concentrations in AD. Additionally, we utilised whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data obtained from a separate group of individuals with AD and controls. This information allowed us to create and investigate host-microbiome personalised whole-body metabolic models. Notably, AD individuals displayed diminished formate microbial secretion in these models. Additionally, we identified specific reactions responsible for the production of formate in the host, and interestingly, these reactions were linked to genes that have correlations with AD. This study suggests formate as a possible early AD marker and highlights genetic and microbiome contributions to its production. The reduced formate secretion and its genetic associations point to a complex connection between gut microbiota and AD. This holistic understanding might pave the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues in AD management.

## Antibacterial activity of nonantibiotics is orthogonal to standard antibiotics.
 14.03.2024, _MN Guillen, C Li, B Rosener, A Mitchell_


Numerous nonantibiotic drugs have potent antibacterial activity and can adversely impact the human microbiome. The mechanistic underpinning of this toxicity remains largely unknown. We investigated the antibacterial activity of 200 drugs using genetic screens with thousands of barcoded Escherichia coli knockouts. We analyzed 2 million gene-drug interactions underlying drug-specific toxicity. Network-based analysis of drug-drug similarities revealed that antibiotics clustered into modules consistent with the mode of action of their established classes, while nonantibiotics remained unconnected. Half of the nonantibiotics clustered into separate modules, potentially revealing shared and unexploited targets for novel antimicrobials. Analysis of efflux systems revealed they widely impact antibiotics and nonantibiotics alike, suggesting that the impact of nonantibiotics on antibiotic cross-resistance should be investigated closely in vivo.

## Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy has an overt killing effect on periodontal pathogens? A systematic review of experimental studies.
 25.02.2020, _D Peron, A Bergamo, R Prates, SS Vieira, P de Tarso Camillo de Carvalho, AJ Serra_

The periodontal disease (PD) etiology is mainly associated with some bacterial strains, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). Nonsurgical root scaling (e.g., antibiotics) may achieve a temporary decrease in the P. gingivalis level, yet it cannot eradicate the microorganism. Moreover, antibiotics can lead to bacterial resistance and undesirable side effects. This systematic review was performed to identify animal data defining antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PACT) role on experimental PD models in the treatment of P. gingivalis. Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed were examined for studies published from January 1980 to August 2018. MeSH terms and Scopus data were used to find more related keywords. Four studies were selected and reviewed by two independent researches with a structured tool for rating the research quality. The beneficial effect of PACT included reductions in P. gingivalis counts, bleeding on probing, redness, and inflammation on multiple sites (i.e., first molar, dental implants; subgingival; and mandibular premolars). Although our results suggest that PACT displays antimicrobial action on P. gingivalis, thus improving the PD, a nonuniformity in the PACT protocol and the limited number of studies included lead to consider that the bactericidal efficacy of PACT against periodontal pathogens in PD remains unclear.

## The individual response to antibiotics and diet - insights into gut microbial resilience and host metabolism.
 15.03.2024, _LMM Vliex, J Penders, A Nauta, EG Zoetendal, EE Blaak_


Antibiotic use disrupts microbial composition and activity in humans, but whether this disruption in turn affects host metabolic health is unclear. Cohort studies show associations between antibiotic use and an increased risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here, we review available clinical trials and show the disruptive effect of antibiotic use on the gut microbiome in humans, as well as its impact on bile acid metabolism and microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids. Placebo-controlled human studies do not show a consistent effect of antibiotic use on body weight and insulin sensitivity at a population level, but rather an individual-specific or subgroup-specific response. This response to antibiotic use is affected by the resistance and resilience of the gut microbiome, factors that determine the extent of disruption and the speed of recovery afterwards. Nutritional strategies to improve the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome, as well as its recovery after antibiotic use (for instance, with prebiotics), require a personalized approach to increase their efficacy. Improved insights into key factors that influence the individual-specific response to antibiotics and dietary intervention may lead to better efficacy in reversing or preventing antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis as well as strategies for preventing cardiometabolic diseases.

## Unveiling the immunomodulatory effect of the novel probiotic Akkermansia muciniphila and its protective effect in vitro.
 15.03.2024, _A Calvo, Y Pastor, P Rosas-Val, C Gamazo_


Akkermansia muciniphila, a bacterium found in the human microbiota, has gained interest due to its potential health benefits. Previous studies have linked its absence to inflammatory disorders, while also suggesting its role in maintaining a healthy gut barrier. However, there is limited information on its specific effects on the immune system. Therefore, the aim of this research was to analyze the in vitro response triggered by A. muciniphila employing RAW 264.7 macrophages. The study focused on investigating the production of cytokines and nitric oxide, along with evaluating the expression of inflammatory surface cellular markers. Additionally, we assessed its potential to protect against intestinal infections, using Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis as a model. Our findings reveal a modulation effect of A. muciniphila with pro-inflammatory features, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulation of CD40 and CD80 surface markers, in contrast with previous reported data. Importantly, A. muciniphila could protect against Salmonella infection by promoting macrophage activation, appearing as a promising probiotic candidate for the control of intestinal infections.
