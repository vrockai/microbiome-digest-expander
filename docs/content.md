## Acute effects of voluntary isometric contractions at maximal shortening vs. ballistic stretching on flexibility, strength and jump.

Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump.

## Clustering Based on Laboratory Data in Patients With Heart Failure Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
 05.10.2024, _S Nemati, B Mohammadi, Z Hooshanginezhad_


Heart failure (HF) is a common condition that imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems. We aimed to identify subgroups of patients with heart failure admitted to the ICU using routinely measured laboratory biomarkers.

Motor function has correlated with longevity and functionality; however, there is limited research on those with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We studied the association between motor functionality and AD pathology in primary motor and medial temporal cortices.
