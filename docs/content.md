The increasing incidence of cancer and intestinal mucositis induced by chemotherapeutics are causing worldwide concern. Many approaches such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have been used to minimize mucositis. However, it is still unknown whether FMT from a donor with beneficial gut microbiota results in more effective intestinal function in the recipient. Recently, we found that alginate oligosaccharides (AOS) benefit murine gut microbiota through increasing "beneficial" microbes to rescue busulfan induced mucositis.

## Catabolism and interactions of uncultured organisms shaped by eco-thermodynamics in methanogenic bioprocesses.

Current understanding of the carbon cycle in methanogenic environments involves trophic interactions such as interspecies H2 transfer between organotrophs and methanogens. However, many metabolic processes are thermodynamically sensitive to H2 accumulation and can be inhibited by H2 produced from co-occurring metabolisms. Strategies for driving thermodynamically competing metabolisms in methanogenic environments remain unexplored.

River confluences are interesting ecological niche with limited information in respect of the structure and the functions of diverse microbial communities. Fungi are gaining global attention as promising biological spectacles for defining the trophic status of riverine systems. We condense existing knowledge in confluence diversity in two Indian rivers (i.e. Ganges and Yamuna), by combining sediment metagenomics using long read aided MinION nanopore sequencing. A total of 63 OTU's were observed, of which top 20 OTU's were considered based on relative abundance of each OTU at a particular location. Fungal genera such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Kluveromyces, Lodderomyces, and Nakaseomyces were deciphered as potential bio indicators of river pollution and eutrophication in the confluent zone. In silico functional gene analysis uncovered hits for neurodegenerative diseases and xenobiotic degradation potential, supporting bioindication of river pollution in wake of anthropogenic intervention.
