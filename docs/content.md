## Modulating host gene expression via gut microbiome-microRNA interplay to treat human diseases.
 18.08.2021, _D Mody, V Verma, V Rani_


The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract hosts trillions of microbial inhabitants involved in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, dysbiosis of which provokes a motley of pathogenic and autoimmune disorders. While the mechanisms by which the microbiota modulates human health are manifold, their liberated metabolites from ingested dietary supplements play a crucial role by bidirectionally regulating the expression of micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs). miRNAs are small endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that have been confirmed to be involved in an interplay with microbiota to regulate host gene expression. This comprehensive review focuses on key principles of miRNAs, their regulation, and crosstalk with gut microbiota to influence host gene expression in various human disorders, by bringing together important recent findings centric around miRNA-microbiota interactions in diseases along various axis of the gut with other organs. We also attempt to lay emphasis on exploiting the avenues of gut-directed miRNA therapeutics using rudimentary dietary supplements to regulate abnormal host gene expression in diseases, opening doors to an accessible and economical therapeutic strategy.

## The Cancer Microbiome: Recent Highlights and Knowledge Gaps.
 17.08.2021, _RJ Knippel, JL Drewes, CL Sears_


knowledge of the human microbiome, which is likely a critical factor in the initiation, progression, and prognosis of multiple forms of cancer, is rapidly expanding. In this review, we focus on recent investigations to discern putative, causative microbial species and the microbiome composition and structure currently associated with procarcinogenesis and tumorigenesis at select body sites. We specifically highlight forms of cancer, gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal, that have significant bacterial associations and well-defined experimental evidence with the aim of generating directions for future experimental and translational investigations to develop a clearer understanding of the multifaceted mechanisms by which microbiota affect cancer formation. SIGNIFICANCE: Emerging and, for some cancers, strong experimental and translational data support the contribution of the microbiome to cancer biology and disease progression. Disrupting microbiome features and pathways contributing to cancer may provide new approaches to improving cancer outcomes in patients.

## The varying effects of antibiotics on gut microbiota.
 17.08.2021, _L Yang, O Bajinka, PO Jarju, Y Tan, AM Taal, G Ozdemir_


Antibiotics are lifesaving therapeutic drugs that have been used by human for decades. They are used both in the fight against bacterial pathogens for both human and for animal feeding. However, of recent, their effects on the gut microbial compositions and diversities have attracted much attention. Existing literature have established the dysbiosis (reduced diversity) in the gut microbiota in association with antibiotic and antibiotic drug doses. In the light of spelling out the varying effects of antibiotic use on gut microbiota, this review aimed at given an account on the degree of gut microbial alteration caused by common antibiotics. While some common antibiotics are found to destroy the common phyla, other debilitating effects were observed. The effects can be attributed to the mode of mechanism, the class of antibiotic, the degree of resistance of the antibiotic used, the dosage used during the treatment, the route of administration, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties and the spectrum of the antibiotic agent. Health status, stress or the type of diet an individual feeds on could be a great proportion as confounding factors. While it is understood that only the bacterial communities are explored in the quest to establishing the role of gut in health, other gut microbial species are somehow contributing to the dysbiosis status of the gut microbiota. Until now, long term natural fluctuations like diseases outbreaks and mutations of the strain might as well rendered alteration to the gut independent of antibiotic treatments.

## Prevotella diversity, niches and interactions with the human host.
 12.08.2021, _A Tett, E Pasolli, G Masetti, D Ercolini, N Segata_


The genus Prevotella includes more than 50 characterized species that occur in varied natural habitats, although most Prevotella spp. are associated with humans. In the human microbiome, Prevotella spp. are highly abundant in various body sites, where they are key players in the balance between health and disease. Host factors related to diet, lifestyle and geography are fundamental in affecting the diversity and prevalence of Prevotella species and strains in the human microbiome. These factors, along with the ecological relationship of Prevotella with other members of the microbiome, likely determine the extent of the contribution of Prevotella to human metabolism and health. Here we review the diversity, prevalence and potential connection of Prevotella spp. in the human host, highlighting how genomic methods and analysis have improved and should further help in framing their ecological role. We also provide suggestions for future research to improve understanding of the possible functions of Prevotella spp. and the effects of the Western lifestyle and diet on the host-Prevotella symbiotic relationship in the context of maintaining human health.

## Bacterial colonization dynamics and antibiotic resistance gene dissemination in the hospital environment after first patient occupancy: a longitudinal metagenetic study.
 17.08.2021, _TE Klassert, R Leistner, C Zubiria-Barrera, M Stock, M López, R Neubert, D Driesch, P Gastmeier, H Slevogt_


Humans spend the bulk of their time in indoor environments. This space is shared with an indoor ecosystem of microorganisms, which are in continuous exchange with the human inhabitants. In the particular case of hospitals, the environmental microorganisms may influence patient recovery and outcome. An understanding of the bacterial community structure in the hospital environment is pivotal for the prevention of hospital-acquired infections and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. In this study, we performed a longitudinal metagenetic approach in a newly opened ward at the Charité Hospital (Berlin) to characterize the dynamics of the bacterial colonization process in the hospital environment after first patient occupancy.

## Different responses of the oral, nasal and lung microbiomes to cigarette smoke.
 14.08.2021, _S Pfeiffer, C Herzmann, KI Gaede, D Kovacevic, S Krauss-Etschmann, M Schloter_


To examine the role of smoking on the bacterial community composition of the upper and the lower respiratory tract, a monocentric, controlled prospective study was performed, including healthy smokers, ex-smokers and never-smokers. Smokers were further grouped according to their smoking history. Bacterial diversity was analysed using a molecular barcoding approach based on directly extracted DNA. Our study shows for the first time distinct bacterial response patterns in the upper and lower respiratory tract to cigarette smoking leading to a higher abundance of opportunistic pathogens. The clinical significance of these dysbioses for health needs to be further explored.

## The power and potential of BIOMAP to elucidate host-microbiome interplay in skin inflammatory diseases.
 13.08.2021, _H Alenius, H Sinkko, L Moitinho-Silva, E Rodriguez, C Broderick, H Alexander, M Reiger, M Hjort Hjelmsø, N Fyhrquist, P Olah, P Bryce, C Smith, F Koning, K Eyerich, D Greco, EH van den Bogaard, AU Neumann, C Traidl-Hoffmann, B Homey, C Flohr, K Bønnelykke, J Stokholm, S Weidinger_


The two most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases are atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. The underpinnings of the remarkable degree of clinical heterogeneity of AD and psoriasis are poorly understood and, as a consequence, disease onset and progression are unpredictable and the optimal type and time-point for intervention are as yet unknown. The BIOMAP project is the first IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative) project dedicated to investigating the causes and mechanisms of AD and psoriasis and to identify potential biomarkers responsible for the variation in disease outcome. The consortium includes 7 large pharmaceutical companies and 25 non-industry partners including academia. Since there is mounting evidence supporting an important role for microbial exposures and our microbiota as factors mediating immune polarization and AD and psoriasis pathogenesis, an entire work package is dedicated to the investigation of skin and gut microbiome linked to AD or psoriasis. The large collaborative BIOMAP project will enable the integration of patient cohorts, data and knowledge in unprecedented proportions. The project has a unique opportunity with a potential to bridge and fill the gaps between current problems and solutions. This review highlights the power and potential of BIOMAP project in the investigation of microbe-host interplay in AD and psoriasis.

## The role of oral bacteria in inflammatory bowel disease.
 17.08.2021, _E Read, MA Curtis, JF Neves_


Over the past two decades, the importance of the microbiota in health and disease has become evident. Pathological changes to the oral bacterial microbiota, such as those occurring during periodontal disease, are associated with multiple inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease. However, the degree to which this association is a consequence of elevated oral inflammation or because oral bacteria can directly drive inflammation at distal sites remains under debate. In this Perspective, we propose that in inflammatory bowel disease, oral disease-associated bacteria translocate to the intestine and directly exacerbate disease. We propose a multistage model that involves pathological changes to the microbial and immune compartments of both the oral cavity and intestine. The evidence to support this hypothesis is critically evaluated and the relevance to other diseases in which oral bacteria have been implicated (including colorectal cancer and liver disease) are discussed.

## Inflammation-type dysbiosis of the oral microbiome associates with the duration of COVID-19 symptoms and long-COVID.
 17.08.2021, _JP Haran, E Bradley, AL Zeamer, L Cincotta, MC Salive, P Dutta, S Mutaawe, O Anya, M Meza-Segura, AM Moormann, DV Ward, BA McCormick, V Bucci_


The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and now many face the burden of prolonged symptoms-long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms or "long-COVID". Long-COVID is thought to be linked to immune dysregulation due to harmful inflammation, with the exact causes being unknown. Given the role of the microbiome in mediating inflammation, we aimed to examine the relationship between the oral microbiome and the duration of long-COVID symptoms. Tongue swabs were collected from patients presenting with symptoms concerning for COVID-19. Confirmed infections were followed until resolution of all symptoms. Bacterial composition was determined by metagenomic sequencing. We used random forest modeling to identify microbiota and clinical covariates that associated with long-COVID symptoms. Of the patients followed, 63% (17/27) developed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 and 37% (10/27) went on to long-COVID. Patients with prolonged symptoms had significantly higher abundances of microbiota that induce inflammation, such as members of the genera Prevotella and Veillonella. Of note are species that produce lipopolysaccharides and the similarity of long-COVID patients' oral microbiome to those of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. All together, we our findings suggest an association with the oral microbiome and long-COVID revealing the possibility that dysfunction of the oral microbiome may contribute to this draining disease.

## Phage Diversity in the Human Gut Microbiome: a Taxonomist's Perspective.
 17.08.2021, _EM Adriaenssens_


Bacteriophages (phages) have been known for over a century, but only in the last 2 decades have we really come to appreciate how abundant and diverse they are. With that realization, research groups across the globe have shown the importance of phage-based processes in a myriad of environments, including the global oceans and soils, and as part of the human microbiome. Through advances in sequencing technology, genomics, and bioinformatics, we know that the morphological diversity of bacteriophages originally used for taxonomy is eclipsed by their genomic diversity. Because we currently do not have a complete taxonomic framework or naming scheme to describe this diversity, crucial information from virome and microbiome studies is being lost. In this commentary, I will discuss recent advances in taxonomy and its importance for studies of the microbiome with examples of the human gut phageome and make recommendations for future analyses.

## IL-10 Deficiency Accelerates Type 1 Diabetes Development via Modulation of Innate and Adaptive Immune Cells and Gut Microbiota in BDC2.5 NOD Mice.
 17.08.2021, _J Huang, Q Tan, N Tai, JA Pearson, Y Li, C Chao, L Zhang, J Peng, Y Xing, L Zhang, Y Hu, Z Zhou, FS Wong, L Wen_


Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease caused by T cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β cells. BDC2.5 T cells in BDC2.5 CD4+ T cell receptor transgenic Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice (BDC2.5 + NOD mice) can abruptly invade the pancreatic islets resulting in severe insulitis that progresses rapidly but rarely leads to spontaneous diabetes. This prevention of diabetes is mediated by T regulatory (Treg) cells in these mice. In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin 10 (IL-10) in the inhibition of diabetes in BDC2.5 + NOD mice by generating Il-10-deficient BDC2.5 + NOD mice (BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice). Our results showed that BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice displayed robust and accelerated diabetes development. Il-10 deficiency in BDC2.5 + NOD mice promoted the generation of neutrophils in the bone marrow and increased the proportions of neutrophils in the periphery (blood, spleen, and islets), accompanied by altered intestinal immunity and gut microbiota composition. In vitro studies showed that the gut microbiota from BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice can expand neutrophil populations. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated that the depletion of endogenous gut microbiota by antibiotic treatment decreased the proportion of neutrophils. Although Il-10 deficiency in BDC2.5 + NOD mice had no obvious effects on the proportion and function of Treg cells, it affected the immune response and activation of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, the pathogenicity of CD4+ T cells was much increased, and this significantly accelerated the development of diabetes when these CD4+ T cells were transferred into immune-deficient NOD mice. Our study provides novel insights into the role of IL-10 in the modulation of neutrophils and CD4+ T cells in BDC2.5 + NOD mice, and suggests important crosstalk between gut microbiota and neutrophils in type 1 diabetes development.

## Plant developmental stage drives the differentiation in ecological role of the maize microbiome.
 18.08.2021, _C Xiong, BK Singh, JZ He, YL Han, PP Li, LH Wan, GZ Meng, SY Liu, JT Wang, CF Wu, AH Ge, LM Zhang_


Plants live with diverse microbial communities which profoundly affect multiple facets of host performance, but if and how host development impacts the assembly, functions and microbial interactions of crop microbiomes are poorly understood. Here we examined both bacterial and fungal communities across soils, epiphytic and endophytic niches of leaf and root, and plastic leaf of fake plant (representing environment-originating microbes) at three developmental stages of maize at two contrasting sites, and further explored the potential function of phylloplane microbiomes based on metagenomics.

## ZWA: Viral genome assembly and characterization hindrances from virus-host chimeric reads; a refining approach.
 19.08.2021, _N Dovrolis, K Kassela, K Konstantinidis, A Kouvela, S Veletza, I Karakasiliotis_


Viral metagenomics, also known as virome studies, have yielded an unprecedented number of novel sequences, essential in recognizing and characterizing the etiological agent and the origin of emerging infectious diseases. Several tools and pipelines have been developed, to date, for the identification and assembly of viral genomes. Assembly pipelines often result in viral genomes contaminated with host genetic material, some of which are currently deposited into public databases. In the current report, we present a group of deposited sequences that encompass ribosomal RNA (rRNA) contamination. We highlight the detrimental role of chimeric next generation sequencing reads, between host rRNA sequences and viral sequences, in virus genome assembly and we present the hindrances these reads may pose to current methodologies. We have further developed a refining pipeline, the Zero Waste Algorithm (ZWA) that assists in the assembly of low abundance viral genomes. ZWA performs context-depended trimming of chimeric reads, precisely removing their rRNA moiety. These, otherwise discarded, reads were fed to the assembly pipeline and assisted in the construction of larger and cleaner contigs making a substantial impact on current assembly methodologies. ZWA pipeline may significantly enhance virus genome assembly from low abundance samples and virus metagenomics approaches in which a small number of reads determine genome quality and integrity.
