Pulses are dry leguminous crops consisting of beans, lentils, chickpeas, and peas. They are a broad category of food that are often aggregated when their contribution to healthy dietary patterns are disseminated. However, the different genera and varieties of pulses vary in composition and are consumed in different amounts, largely dictated by geographic region and ethnicity. Given the number of pulse-derived components, including fibre, that have the capacity to alter the composition of the gut microbiome, the objective of this study was to systematically review dietary pulses and pulse-derived ingredients as a broader food group, to determine their effect on gut microbiota in humans. Major scientific databases were used to conduct the search, which spanned from 1990 until February 2019. The search strategy identified 2,444 articles and five studies were included in this analysis. Two studies used whole pulses (chickpeas and pinto beans), one study used cooked navy bean powder, and the two remaining studies used pulse-derived fibre (lupin or yellow pea hulls). Although inconsistent, some studies demonstrated that whole pulses (pinto beans and chickpeas), cooked navy bean powder, and pulse-derived fibre (lupin kernel fibre), did impose changes to the microbiota that inhabit the human large intestine. However, there was considerable variability concerning the methodologies and endpoints used to decipher the observed effects on the abundance, diversity, and/or richness of specific microbiota or the microbiome. More extensive human studies that directly link the effects of specific types of pulses on the gastrointestinal microbial environment to health outcomes in the host are required.

Aging is associated with declines in cognitive performance, which are mediated in part by neuroinflammation, characterized by astrocyte activation and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines; however, the upstream drivers are unknown. We investigated the potential role of the gut microbiome-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in modulating neuroinflammation and cognitive function with aging. Study 1: In middle-aged and older humans (65 ± 7 years), plasma TMAO levels were inversely related to performance on NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery tests of memory and fluid cognition (both r2 = 0.07, p &lt; 0.05). Study 2: In mice, TMAO concentrations in plasma and the brain increased in parallel with aging (r2 = 0.60), suggesting TMAO crosses the blood-brain barrier. The greater TMAO concentrations in old mice (27 months) were associated with higher brain pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of astrocyte activation vs. young adult mice (6 months). Study 3: To determine if TMAO independently induces an "aging-like" decline in cognitive function, young mice (6 months) were supplemented with TMAO in chow for 6 months. Compared with controls, TMAO-supplemented mice performed worse on the novel object recognition test, indicating impaired memory and learning, and had increased neuroinflammation and markers of astrocyte activation. Study 4: Human astrocytes cultured with TMAO vs. control media exhibited changes in cellular morphology and protein markers consistent with astrocyte activation, indicating TMAO directly acts on these cells. Our results provide translational insight into a novel pathway that modulates neuroinflammation and cognitive function with aging, and suggest that TMAO might be a promising target for prevention of neuroinflammation and cognitive decline with aging.

## Gut commensal microbiota and decreased risk for Enterobacteriaceae bacteriuria and urinary tract infection.
 31.08.2020, _M Magruder, E Edusei, L Zhang, S Albakry, MJ Satlin, LF Westblade, L Malha, C Sze, M Lubetzky, DM Dadhania, JR Lee_


Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common complication in kidney transplant recipients and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence supports a role for the gut as a source for UTIs but little is known about the relationship between gut commensal bacteria and UTI development. We hypothesized that the abundance of gut commensal bacteria is associated with a lower risk of developing bacteriuria and UTIs. We performed gut microbiome profiling using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4-V5 hypervariable region on 510 fecal specimens in 168 kidney transplant recipients. Fifty-one kidney transplant recipients (30%) developed Enterobacteriaceae bacteriuria within the first 6 months after transplantation (Enterobacteriaceae Bacteriuria Group) and 117 did not (No Enterobacteriaceae Bacteriuria Group). The relative abundances of Faecalibacterium and Romboutsia were significantly higher in the fecal specimens from the No Enterobacteriaceae Bacteriuria Group than those from the Enterobacteriaceae Bacteriuria Group (Adjusted P value&lt;.01). The combined relative abundance of Faecalibacterium and Romboutsia was inversely correlated with the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (r = -0.13, P = .003). In a multivariable Cox Regression, a top tercile cutoff of the combined relative abundance of Faecalibacterium and Romboutsia of ≥13.7% was independently associated with a decreased risk for Enterobacteriaceae bacteriuria (hazard ratio 0.3, P = .02) and Enterobacteriaceae UTI (hazard ratio 0.4, P = .09). In conclusion, we identify bacterial taxa associated with decreased risk for Enterobacteriaceae bacteriuria and Enterobacteriaceae UTI in kidney transplant recipients, which supports future studies on modulating the gut microbiota as a novel treatment for preventing UTIs.

## Leveraging sequence-based faecal microbial community survey data to identify alterations in gut microbiota among patients with Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease is a common degenerative disease of the elderly. Although the majority of studies have focused on the central nervous system (CNS) features of Parkinson's Disease, recent findings suggest there is a functional link between the gut microbiome and the hallmarks of the disease. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and other Chinese and English databases were searched for relevant literature. Studies on changes to intestinal microbiota in Parkinson's patients were retrieved and systematically reviewed. Quality filtering, clustering, and species annotation were performed on 16s sequencing raw data from retrieved studies to achieve comparability across studies. Alpha diversity indices and a random effect model were used to analyse significantly altered microbiota.A total of nine studies were included in this retrospective analysis, four of which contained raw data. Alpha diversity was significantly different between control and Parkinson's Disease patients in two of the four studies. Using the raw data from four individual studies, we observed differences in the phlya Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Additionally, differences were observed between control and Parkinson's Disease patients at the level of family (Prevotellacaea and Lactobacillaceae) and genus (Bifidobacterium and Clostridium). This study confirmed that changes in the microbiome are a consistent feature of Parkinson's Disease patients and therefore may contribute to the onset of disease.

## Plasma enterobacterial ClpB levels and ClpB- and α-MSH-reactive immunoglobulins in lung cancer patients with and without anorexia.
 31.08.2020, _A Molfino, MI Amabile, G Imbimbo, A Emiliani, C Ramaccini, E Lahaye, K Takagi, SO Fetissov_


Anorexia represents a common and debilitating clinical problem in patients with several forms of cancer, in particular lung cancer, but its mechanisms are not completely understood. Recently, the caseinolytic-protease-B (ClpB) homologue protein, produced by common gut bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, was identified as an antigen-mimetic of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), an anorexigenic neuropeptide. ClpB was previously detected in human plasma and displayed satietogenic properties; however, its possible relevance to cancer anorexia has not yet been investigated.

## Suppression of rice planthopper populations without affecting the rice microbiota by the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae.
 29.08.2020, _Y Peng, J Tang, M Hong, J Xie_


Entomopathogenic fungi can regulate insect populations and function as crucial biological control agents against insect pests, but their impacts on nontarget microorganisms are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the potential of the fungal strain Metarhizium anisopliae CQMa421 to control rice planthoppers under field conditions and its effects on rice microbiota. This fungus suppressed rice planthoppers during this period, and its control efficiency was more than 60% 7 days post application and did not significantly differ from that of the chemical treatment except in 2019. Both treatments showed a lower population of rice planthoppers than the controls. After application, M. anisopliae was maintained on rice plants for approximately 14 days, showing a decreasing trend over time. Furthermore, the results showed that the bacterial and fungal richness (operational taxonomic units) and diversity (Shannon index) did not significantly differ between the fungal treatment and the controls after application. The major bacterial taxa of Proteobacteria (including Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria), Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria accounted for more than 80% of the bacterial community after fungal application, and the major fungal taxa of Ascomycota (including Eurotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes), and Basidiomycota (including Ustilaginomycetes) represented more than 90% of fungal community. However, the microbial communities of the rice phyllosphere did not significantly change after entomopathogenic agent application, indicating that the indigenous microbial communities may adapt to fungal insecticide application. Taken together, the results suggest that this fungal agent has good potential for rice planthopper control with no substantial effects on rice microbial communities.IMPORTANCE Entomopathogenic fungi may be used as crucial biocontrol agents for the control of insect pests, but few effective fungal strains have been reported for the control of the rice planthopper, a major pest of rice. More importantly, the impacts of fungal insecticide application on nontarget microorganisms have not been well evaluated, especially under field conditions. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of the fungal strain M. anisopliae CQMa421 on rice planthopper populations from 2017 to 2019 and evaluated its potential impacts on the microbiota of rice plants after application. The results suggested that this fungal agent has good potential for use in the control of rice planthoppers with no significant effects on rice microbial communities, representing an alternative strategy for the control of rice pests.
