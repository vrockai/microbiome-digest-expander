Pregnancies conceived via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are associated with a higher risk of fetal cardiac remodeling. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the type of embryo transfer may affect the magnitude of fetal cardiac remodeling in pregnancies conceived via ICSI.

The early-life microbiota triggers life-long effects on physiological functions and health disorders. Previous studies in adult twins or animal models have revealed associations between host genetics and the harmonious microbiota. However, such associations may be obscured by the fact that each intra-pair of twins will continually encounter various environmental factors as they grow up. Here, we collected the meconium samples from nineteen dizygotic pairs (DZ, n = 38) and nine monozygotic pairs (MZ, n = 18) with cesarean delivery, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to profile the microbiome at birth. Diversity analysis showed that alpha diversity was not significantly different between two groups, whereas beta diversity of MZ twins was significantly lower than that of either DZ twins or unrelated individuals (i.e., randomly selected individual pairs of non-twinship) (p &lt; 0.05). Two groups had very similar microbial classifications but different relative abundances of certain taxa including more Firmicutes (p = 0.05, Wilcoxon test) at the phylum level and lower abundances of five genera (p &lt; 0.05) in DZ group compared to MZ group, including Rheinheimera, Proteus, SMB53, Sphingobium, and Megamonas. Co-occurrence analysis in each group showed slightly more complicated microbial interactions in DZ than MZ twins, although 22 shared bacterial genera co-existed in two groups, with both Rheinheimera and Megamonas having different centralities in their respective co-occurrence networks. Mean intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) were also significantly higher for MZ (0.312) compared to DZ twins (0.138) (p &lt; 0.05). The predicted microbial gene functions related to carbohydrate were higher in DZ group, whereas folding, sorting, degradation, cell motility pathways and energy metabolism were markedly over-represented in the microbiota of MZ group. In summary, our study uncovered that microbial diversity and components of the meconium microbiome between DZ and MZ twins were partially consistent with that in singleton neonates by cesarean delivery, but several distinctions related to the heritability supported genetic contributions to intestinal microbiome in early life.

## Autoreactivity in na√Øve human fetal B cells is associated with commensal bacteria recognition.

Restricted V(D)J recombination during fetal development was postulated to limit antibody repertoire breadth and prevent autoimmunity. However, newborn serum contains abundant autoantibodies, suggesting that B cell tolerance during gestation is not yet fully established. To investigate this apparent paradox, we evaluated the reactivities of more than 450 antibodies cloned from single B cells from human fetal liver, bone marrow, and spleen. We found that incomplete B cell tolerance in early human fetal life favored the accumulation of polyreactive B cells that bound both apoptotic cells and commensal bacteria from healthy adults. Thus, the restricted fetal preimmune repertoire contains potentially beneficial self-reactive innate-like B cell specificities that may facilitate the removal of apoptotic cells during development and shape gut microbiota assembly after birth.
