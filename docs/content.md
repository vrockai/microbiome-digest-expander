## Quantifying Technical Confounders in Microbiome Studies.

Recent technical developments have allowed the study of the human microbiome to accelerate at an unprecedented pace. Methodological differences may have considerable impact on the results obtained. Thus, we investigated how different storage, isolation and DNA extraction methods can influence the characterization of the intestinal microbiome, compared to the impact of true biological signals such as intraindividual variability, nutrition, health and demographics.

## Aging and the Combined effects of ADRA2B and CB1 deletions on Affective Working Memory.

Many studies have found that memory for affective material is better than memory for neutral information and memory for positive material compared to negative material is better in older adults. Behavioral, neurophysiological as well as single polymorphism differences have been advanced to account for these effects. Here, we aimed to examine whether the combination of two polymorphisms (ADRA2B and CB1) in older adults influences active maintenance and manipulation of emotional information in aging working memory. We examined genotype data from 207 older adults (56 double deletion carriers, 116 single deletion carriers and 35 no deletion carriers) who performed a verbal operation span-like task with positive, negative and neutral words. We found that subjects carrying both ADRA2B and CB1 variants generally remembered a higher number of words. In addition, double carriers showed positivity effects while single carriers showed more general emotional enhancement effects, especially as strings lengthened. These findings are amongst the first to suggest a haplotype account of positivity effects in older adults' memory.

## Elevated liver stiffness without histological evidence of liver fibrosis in rural Ugandans.

Liverfibrosismay beassessed non-invasively with transient electrography (TE). Data on the performance of TE for detecting liver fibrosis in sub-Saharan Africa are limited.We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of TE by performing liver biopsies on persons with liver fibrosis indicated by TE. We enrolled HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected participants with TE scores consistent with at least minimal disease (liver stiffness measurement [LSM]≥7.1kPa). Biopsieswere performed and staged using the Ishak scoring system. A concordant result was defined using accepted thresholds for significant fibrosis by TE (LSM≥9.3 kPa) and liver biopsy (Ishak score≥2). We used modified Poisson regressionmethods to quantify the univariate and adjusted prevalence risk ratios (PRR)of the association between covariates and the concordance status of TE and liver biopsy in defining the presence of liver fibrosis. Of 131 participants with valid liver biopsy and TE data, only 5 participants (3.8%) had Ishak score ≥2 of whom 4 had LSM≥9.3 kPa (sensitivity = 80%);of the 126(96.2%)withIshak score &lt;2, 76 had LSM&lt;9.3kPa (specificity =61%). In multivariable analysis, discordance wasassociated with female gender (adjPRR=1.80, 95%CI 1.1-2.9; p=0.019), herbal medicine use (adjPRR 1.64,95%CI=1.0-2.5; p=0.022), exposure to lake or river water (adjPRR 2.05, 95%CI=1.1-3.7; p=0.016), and current smoking (adjPRR 1.72, 95%CI 1.0-2.9; p=0.045).These data suggest that TE among rural Ugandans has low specificity for detection of histologically confirmed liver fibrosis. Caution should be exercised when using this tool to confirm significant liver fibrosis.
