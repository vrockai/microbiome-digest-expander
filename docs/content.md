Characterizing complex microbial communities with single-cell resolution has been a long-standing goal of microbiology. We present Microbe-seq, a high-throughput method that yields the genomes of individual microbes from complex microbial communities. We encapsulate individual microbes in droplets with microfluidics and liberate their DNA, which we then amplify, tag with droplet-specific barcodes, and sequence. We explore the human gut microbiome, sequencing more than 20,000 microbial single-amplified genomes (SAGs) from a single human donor and coassembling genomes of almost 100 bacterial species, including several with multiple subspecies strains. We use these genomes to probe microbial interactions, reconstructing the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) network and observing HGT between 92 species pairs; we also identify a significant in vivo host-phage association between crAssphage and one strain of Bacteroides vulgatus. Microbe-seq contributes high-throughput culture-free capabilities to investigate genomic blueprints of complex microbial communities with single-microbe resolution.

## Gut microbiome and autoimmune disorders.
 02.06.2022, _WA Shaheen, MN Quraishi, TH Iqbal_


Autoimmune diseases have long been known to share a common pathogenesis involving a dysregulated immune system with failure to recognize self from non-self antigens. This immune dysregulation is now increasingly understood to be induced by environmental triggers in genetically predisposed individuals. Although several external environmental triggers have been defined in different autoimmune diseases, much attention is being paid to the role of the internal micro-environment occupied by the microbiome which was once termed "the forgotten organ". In this regard, the gut microbiome, serving as an intermediary between some of those external environmental effectors and the immune system helps programming of the immune system to be tolerant to innocent external and self antigens. However, in the presence of perturbed gut microbiota (dysbiosis), the immune system could be erroneously directed in favor of pro-inflammatory pathways to instigate different autoimmune processes. An accumulating body of evidence, including both experimental and human studies (observational and interventional) points to a role of gut microbiome in different autoimmune diseases. Such evidence could provide a rationale for gut microbiome manipulation with therapeutic and even preventative intents in patients with established or predisposed to autoimmune diseases respectively. Perturbations of the gut microbiome have been delineated in some immune mediated diseases, IBD in particular. However, such patterns of disturbance (microbiome signatures) and related pathogenetic roles of the gut microbiome are context dependent and cannot be generalized in the same exact way to other autoimmune disorders and the contribution of gut microbiome to different disease phenotypes has to be precisely defined. In this review, we revise the evidence for a role of gut microbiome in various autoimmune diseases and possible mechanisms mediating such a role.
