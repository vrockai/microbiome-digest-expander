## The Microbiota of Human Lung of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and the Alteration Caused by Anti-tuberculosis Drugs.
 20.09.2022, _M Zhang, L Shen, X Zhou, H Chen_


An in-depth understanding of the lung microbiota in tuberculosis (TB) infection could provide optimal strategies for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Only a few studies have investigated the impact of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and anti-TB treatment on the lung microbiota. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood samples were collected from 23 active TB patients (TBZ), 17 latent tuberculosis infection patients (LTBI), 13 healthy controls (HC), and 14 active TB patients with 1-month anti-TB therapy (TBM) for 16S RNA sequencing and serological indexes, respectively. Low body mass index, albumin, and total triglyceride levels were detected in TBZ. Pulmonary Mtb infection led to a minor decrease in the alpha diversity of the lung microbiota in TBZ than HC, but a significant difference was noted in beta diversity. Subsequently, anti-TB therapy caused a rapid alteration in the lung community structure due to reduced alpha and beta diversity. Proteobacteria were abundant in TBZ samples, while Firmicutes was predominant in the LITB and HC samples. Lactobacillus and Subdoligranulum (genera) were the most unique in the LTBI and HC group, respectively. The TBM group showed the most predominant abundance of Bacteroides, Oscillospira, and Ruminococcus (genera). Functional pathways, such as indole alkaloid biosynthesis, Wnt signaling pathway, endocytosis, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, significantly decreased in the TBM group compared with TBZ group. Pulmonary TB and anti-TB treatment caused a distinct dysbiosis of the lung microbiome. The current findings suggested potential links between the lung microbiota and TB onset, progression, and treatment.

## Recent advances on the mechanisms of kidney stone formation (Review).

Kidney stone disease is one of the oldest diseases known to medicine; however, the mechanisms of stone formation and development remain largely unclear. Over the past decades, a variety of theories and strategies have been developed and utilized in the surgical management of kidney stones, as a result of recent technological advances. Observations from the authors and other research groups suggest that there are five entirely different main mechanisms for kidney stone formation. Urinary supersaturation and crystallization are the driving force for intrarenal crystal precipitation. Randall's plaques are recognized as the origin of calcium oxalate stone formation. Sex hormones may be key players in the development of nephrolithiasis and may thus be potential targets for new drugs to suppress kidney stone formation. The microbiome, including ureaseâ€‘producing bacteria, nanobacteria and intestinal microbiota, is likely to have a profound effect on urological health, both positive and negative, owing to its metabolic output and other contributions. Lastly, the immune response, and particularly macrophage differentiation, play crucial roles in renal calcium oxalate crystal formation. In the present study, the current knowledge for each of these five aspects of kidney stone formation is reviewed. This knowledge may be used to explore novel research opportunities and improve the understanding of the initiation and development of kidney stones for urologists, nephrologists and primary care.

## Comparison of tumor-associated and nontumor-associated esophageal mucosa microbiota in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
 20.09.2022, _B Zhang, Q Xiao, H Chen, T Zhou, Y Yin_


Esophageal microbiota plays important roles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The aims of this study were to clarify the changes in the bacterial community during ESCC development and identify latent pathogenic bacteria which may contribute to esophageal carcinogenesis and progression. Fresh tumor and nontumor esophageal mucosal samples were collected from 31 men with ESCC. High-throughput 16s rRNA sequencing was performed, and the operational taxonomic unit data and bacterial classification annotation were obtained and analyzed. The Ace, Chao, Shannon, Simpson indexes, and operational taxonomic unit numbers were higher in nontumor tissues than in tumor tissues, although without statistical significance. There were 4 phyla and 28 genera found to show significant differences between tumor and nontumor samples. The general probiotic Lactobacillus was 1.98-fold higher in nontumor tissues, while the general pathogenic genera Fusobacterium was 4.35-fold higher in tumor tissues. For tumor tissue samples, the genera Treponema and Brevibacillus were significantly higher in N1 and N2 stages, respectively, and Acinetobacter was significantly higher in T3 stage. For nontumor tissues, the genus Fusicatenibacter was significantly higher in T2 stage, and Corynebacterium, Aggregatibacter, Saccharimonadaceae-TM7x, and Cupriavidus were significantly higher in T4 stage. Additionally, bacteria related to nitrotoluene degradation were enriched in nontumor tissues, while bacteria related to base excision repair were enriched in tumor tissues. The relative abundance of several phyla and genera are different between tumor and nontumor tissue samples. The altered bacterial microbiota is correlated with different tumor stages and some microbes may take part in the carcinogenesis and development of ESCC.

## Differential co-expression networks of the gut microbiota are associated with depression and anxiety treatment resistance among psychiatric inpatients.
 19.09.2022, _DS Thompson, C Fu, T Gandhi, JC Fowler, BC Frueh, BL Weinstein, J Petrosino, JK Hadden, M Carlson, C Coarfa, A Madan_


Comorbid anxiety and depression are common and are associated with greater disease burden than either alone. Our recent efforts have identified an association between gut microbiota dysfunction and severity of anxiety and depression. In this follow-up, we applied Differential Co-Expression Analysis (DiffCoEx) to identify potential gut microbiota biomarker(s) candidates of treatment resistance among psychiatric inpatients.

## Early fecal microbiome transfer after donor defecation determines response in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
 19.09.2022, _A Singh, R Mahajan, BK Kahlon, AS Dhaliwal, V Midha, V Mehta, N Bansal, D Singh, A Sood_


Fecal microbiome transfer (FMT) targeting gut microbiome dysbiosis is an emerging therapy for ulcerative colitis (UC). There is however no consensus on protocols for performing FMT in UC, especially in relation to time after donor feces defecation.

## Modulatory role of gut microbiota in cholesterol and glucose metabolism: Potential implications for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease Atherosclerosis.
 20.09.2022, _J Roessler, DM Leistner, U Landmesser, A Haghikia_


Accumulating evidence suggests an important role of gut microbiota in physiological processes of host metabolism as well as cardiometabolic disease. Recent advances in metagenomic and metabolomic research have led to discoveries of novel pathways in which intestinal microbial metabolism of dietary nutrients is linked to metabolic profiles and cardiovascular disease risk. A number of metaorganismal circuits have been identified by microbiota transplantation studies and experimental models using germ-free rodents. Many of these pathways involve gut microbiota-related bioactive metabolites that impact host metabolism, in particular lipid and glucose homeostasis, partly via specific host receptors. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of how the gut microbiome can impact cardiometabolic phenotypes and provide an overview of recent advances of gut microbiome research. Finally, the potential of modulating intestinal microbiota composition and/or targeting microbiota-related pathways for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies in cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases will be discussed.

_Adult, Archaea, Bacteria, Diet, Ethnicity, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Geography, Humans, Urbanization_
The human gut is home to a largely underexplored microbiome component, the archaeome. Little is known of the impact of geography, urbanization, ethnicity, and diet on the gut archaeome in association with host health. We aim to delineate the variation of the human gut archaeome in healthy individuals and its association with environmental factors and host homeostasis.
