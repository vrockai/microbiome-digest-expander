In the absence of an effective vaccine or curative treatment for HIV, the global HIV/AIDS epidemic continues despite significant advances in treatment and prevention. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs have transformed HIV from a terminal illness to a manageable chronic condition. Likewise, pre-exposure prophylaxis treatment (PrEP) has dramatically reduced transmission in some of the highest risk populations. However, quality of life and life expectancy in people living with HIV (PWH) still lag significantly behind the general population. The mechanisms that reduce the efficacy of PrEP and ART are multifaceted, but one factor that warrants additional attention is the impact of the microbiome on ART and PrEP efficacy, as well as pharmacokinetics more broadly. In this review, we assess the current state of research on the HIV-associated microbiome, how this impacts treatment efficacy, and how microbiome states can alter HIV susceptibility. We also explore how the mechanisms we propose could extend to the efficacy of other drugs and identify promising areas of research that remain understudied. Video Abstract.

## A systematic review of the relationship between gut microbiota and prevalence of pancreatic diseases.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) diseases; it can manifest in varying degrees of severity, sometimes leading to a life-threatening condition for the patient. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), due to its high malignancy and uncertain prognosis, is widely regarded as one of the most fatal diseases. The increasing prevalence of AP and PDAC represents a major burden on public health and the healthcare system worldwide. The aim of this systematic review was to discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the relationship between the gut microbiota and the incidence, prognosis, diagnosis and treatment of AP and PDAC. To identify studies that analyzed the relationship between the gut microbiota and the occurrence/development of pancreatic diseases or PDAC, the online databases PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched between November 2023 and January 2024. Finally, 14 publications met the inclusion criteria (1. were conducted exclusively in humans and/or animals; 2. original, published in English in peer-reviewed journals after 2019; 3. described the relationship between gut microbiota and the occurrence of AP or PDAC). The collected studies indicated significant changes in the gut microbiota of patients with AP and PDAC. Moreover, they highlighted the presence of a relationship between the gut microbiota and the occurrence, course, treatment efficiency and prognosis of the disease in question. Further research is needed to understand precisely the relationship between the gut microbiota and the occurrence of pancreatic diseases and whether it may be a starting point for the development of modern forms of therapy based on the use of prebiotics and/or diet to restore the normal composition of the intestinal bacteria.

## Beneficial microbiome and diet interplay in early-onset colorectal cancer.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although the risk of developing CRC increases with age, approximately 10% of newly diagnosed cases occur in individuals under the age of 50. Significant changes in dietary habits in young adults since industrialization create a favorable microenvironment for colorectal carcinogenesis. We aim here to shed light on the complex interplay between diet and gut microbiome in the pathogenesis and prevention of early-onset CRC (EO-CRC). We provide an overview of dietary risk factors associated with EO-CRC and contrast them with the general trends for CRC. We delve into gut bacteria, fungi, and phages with potential benefits against CRC and discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, based on recent findings from human studies, we offer insights into how dietary modifications could potentially enhance gut microbiome composition to mitigate CRC risk. All together, we outline the current research landscape in this area and propose directions for future investigations that could pave the way for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies.

## Age-stratification reveals age-specific intestinal microbiota signatures in juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) comprises diverse chronic inflammatory conditions driven by malfunction of the immune system. The intestinal microbiota is considered a crucial environmental factor correlating with chronic inflammatory diseases, and for JIA certain alterations in the microbiota have already been described.
