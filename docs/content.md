The vast majority of microorganisms on Earth reside in often-inseparable environment-specific communities-microbiomes. Meta-genomic/-transcriptomic sequencing could reveal the otherwise inaccessible functionality of microbiomes. However, existing analytical approaches focus on attributing sequencing reads to known genes/genomes, often failing to make maximal use of available data. We created faser (functional annotation of sequencing reads), an algorithm that is optimized to map reads to molecular functions encoded by the read-correspondent genes. The mi-faser microbiome analysis pipeline, combining faser with our manually curated reference database of protein functions, accurately annotates microbiome molecular functionality. mi-faser's minutes-per-microbiome processing speed is significantly faster than that of other methods, allowing for large scale comparisons. Microbiome function vectors can be compared between different conditions to highlight environment-specific and/or time-dependent changes in functionality. Here, we identified previously unseen oil degradation-specific functions in BP oil-spill data, as well as functional signatures of individual-specific gut microbiome responses to a dietary intervention in children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Our method also revealed variability in Crohn's Disease patient microbiomes and clearly distinguished them from those of related healthy individuals. Our analysis highlighted the microbiome role in CD pathogenicity, demonstrating enrichment of patient microbiomes in functions that promote inflammation and that help bacteria survive it.

## Benefits of CT Scanning for the Management of Knee Arthritis and Arthroplasty.
 08.04.2020, _N Sodhi, DJ Jacofsky, A Chee, MA Mont_


This review investigated the potential value of computed tomography (CT) scans for the evaluation and management of knee arthritis and arthroplasty. Specifically, we evaluated the following: (1) assessment of arthritis within knee compartments, (2) patellofemoral joint assessment, (3) implant sizing prediction, (4) component alignment, (5) soft-tissue protection, and (6) potential concerns with radiation exposure. To compare if CT or X-ray imaging is more accurate and clinically relevant, a search was performed using Boolean search operators and terms: "CT," "radiograph," "joint alignment," "knee," and "arthroplasty," which yielded 661 results. Studies were evaluated based on (1) assessment of arthritis within knee compartments, (2) patellofemoral joint assessment, (3) implant sizing prediction, (4) component alignment, (5) soft-tissue protection, and (6) potential concerns with radiation exposure. Correlative and comparative analyses of imaging modalities to pre-, intra-, and postoperative clinical and patient-related factors were performed for the 63 included studies. CT scans were found to better detect medial and lateral arthritic changes, bony deformities, subchondral cysts, and cartilage losses. CT scans were shown to 99% accurately predict prosthetic sizes preoperatively. CT scans can also help better visualize surrounding anatomy, such as the posterior cruciate ligament, and have therefore been linked to better soft tissue protection during total knee arthroplasty. Although radiation is a potential concern, newer imaging protocols have comparable exposure to plain radiographs. Compared with plain radiographs, CT scans were found to be more accurate and provide more clinically relevant data. Therefore, the authors recommend the use of CT for the evaluation of certain patients with arthritis and for preoperative planning for knee arthroplasty.
