## Phylogenomics, Epigenomics, Virulome, and Mobilome of Gram-negative Bacteria Co-resistant to Carbapenems and Polymyxins: A One-Health Systematic Review and Meta-analyses.
 07.02.2022, _WT Ramaloko, J Osei Sekyere_


Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) continue to develop resistance against important antibiotics including last-resort ones such as carbapenems and polymyxins. An analysis of GNB with co-resistance to carbapenems and polymyxins from a One Health perspective is presented. Data of species name, country, source of isolation, resistance genes (ARGs), plasmid type, clones, and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were deduced from 129 articles from January 2016 to March 2021. Available genomes and plasmids were obtained from PATRIC and NCBI. Resistomes and methylomes were analysed using BAcWGSTdb and REBASE whilst Kaptive was used to predict capsule typing. Plasmids and other MEGs were identified using MGE Finder and ResFinder. Phylogenetic analyses were done using RAxML and annotated with MEGA 7. A total of 877 isolates, 32 genomes and 44 plasmid sequences were analysed. Most of these isolates were reported in Asian countries and were isolated from clinical, animal, and environmental sources. Colistin resistance was mostly mediated by mgrB inactivation (37%; n = 322) and mcr-1 (36%; n = 312), while OXA-48/181 was the most reported carbapenemase. IncX and IncI were the most common plasmids hosting carbapenemases and mcr genes. The isolates were co-resistant to other antibiotics, with floR (chloramphenicol) and fosA3 (fosfomycin) being common; E. coli ST156 and K. pneumoniae ST258 strains were common globally. Virulence genes and capsular KL-types were also detected. Type I, II, III and IV restriction modification systems were detected, comprising various MTases and restriction enzymes. The escalation of highly resistant isolates drains the economy due to untreatable bacterial infections, which leads to increasing global mortality rates and healthcare costs.

## Global diversity and distribution of mushroom-inhabiting bacteria.
 01.02.2022, _D Gohar, K Põldmaa, L Tedersoo, F Aslani, B Furneaux, TW Henkel, I Saar, ME Smith, M Bahram_


Mushroom-forming fungi are important sources of food and medicine in many regions of the world, and their development and health are known to depend on various microbes. Recent studies have examined the structure of mushroom-inhabiting bacterial (MIB) communities and their association with local environmental variables, but global-scale diversity and determinants of these communities remain poorly understood. Here we examined the MIB global diversity and community composition in relation to climate, soil and host factors. We found a core global mushroom microbiome, accounting for 30% of sequence reads, while comprising a few bacterial genera such as Halomonas, Serratia, Bacillus, Cutibacterium, Bradyrhizobium and Burkholderia. Our analysis further revealed an important role of host phylogeny in shaping the communities of MIB, whereas the effects of climate and soil factors remained negligible. The results suggest that the communities of MIB and free-living bacteria are structured by contrasting community assembly processes and that fungal-bacterial interactions are an important determinant of MIB community structure.

## Genomic Epidemiology Insights on NDM-Producing Pathogens Revealed the Pivotal Role of Plasmids on blaNDM Transmission.
 28.02.2022, _H Dong, Y Li, J Cheng, Z Xia, W Liu, T Yan, F Chen, Z Wang, R Li, J Shi, S Qin_


Incidences of nosocomial infections mediated by New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) enzyme-producing Enterobacterales are increasing globally, resulting in a great burden to public health. The carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) were collected from Henan, China during 2013-2016. The blaNDM-positive strains were characterized using PCR, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, conjugation assay, S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE), Southern blot, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and bioinformatics analysis. Eighty-one NDM-producing strains were identified among 391 nonduplicate CRE strains. Among them, four strains cocarried mcr and blaNDM genes, and two carried blaIMP-4 and blaNDM genes. The coexistence of blaNDM-5 and mcr-9 in Enterobacter hormaechei was found for the first time. In total, four blaNDM subtypes were identified. Among them, blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-5 were predominant. There was an obvious increasing trend in blaNDM-5 from 2013 to 2016. Thirteen different bacterial species were found among the 81 strains, and Escherichia coli was the dominant strain. blaNDM genes were located on nine different Inc-type plasmids, most of them on the IncX3 plasmids, except for the Pr-15-2-50 strain, which was located on the chromosome. We characterized two novel plasmids: the IncHI5-like plasmid carrying blaNDM-9 found in K. pneumonia, and the IncI1 blaNDM-5-positive plasmid. These findings provide the genomic basis for the widespread transmission of blaNDM and pave the way for the formulation of more effective monitoring and control methods. IMPORTANCE To control the emergence and transmission of CRE, it is important to perform retrospective genomic investigations. It is important to evaluate the plasmid diversity, genetic environment, and evolutionary relationships of the blaNDM-positive clinical strains in the early transmission stages. This study conducted an in-depth analysis of blaNDM-positive pathogens during a 4-year period using different methods for observing the high prevalence and active transmission of blaNDM-positive CRE. Moreover, we also explored the coexistence of the blaNDM and mcr, a clinically important mobile colistin resistance gene. This study shows that the prevalence of blaNDM-positive pathogens in Henan is high and the isolation rates increase each year. Moreover, plasmid-mediated horizontal transfer plays an important role in blaNDM dissemination. The co-occurrence of multiple resistance genes highlighted a long-lasting evolutionary pathway. Therefore, we have suggested the long-term continuous surveillance of clinical pathogens carrying blaNDM to learn the future transmission trend and curb the public health risk caused by CRE.

## Contributions of Human-Associated Archaeal Metabolites to Tumor Microenvironment and Carcinogenesis.
 28.02.2022, _M Cai, S Kandalai, X Tang, Q Zheng_


There is increasing awareness that archaea are interrelated with human diseases (including cancer). Archaea utilize unique metabolic pathways to produce a variety of metabolites that serve as a direct link to host-microbe interactions. However, knowledge on the diversity of human-associated archaea is still extremely limited, and less is known about the pathological effects of their metabolites to the tumor microenvironment and carcinogenesis. In the present study, we performed a large-scale analysis of archaea and their cancer-related metabolites across different body sites using &gt;44,000 contigs with length &gt;1,000 bp. Taxonomy annotation revealed that the occurrence and diversity of archaea are higher in two body sites, the gut and the oral cavity. Unlike other human-associated microbes, the nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) analyses have shown no difference of archaeal compositions between Easterners and Westerners. Likewise, protein annotation suggests that genes encoding cancer-related metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids and polyamines) are more prevalent and diverse in gut and oral samples. Archaea carrying these metabolites are restricted to Euryarchaeota and the TACK superphylum (Thaumarchaeota, Aigarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Korarchaeota), especially methanogenic archaea, such as Methanobacteria. IMPORTANCE More evidence suggests that archaea are associated with human disease, including cancer. Here, we present the first framework of the diversity and distribution of human-associated archaea across human body sites, such as gut and oral cavity, using long contigs. Furthermore, we unveiled the potential archaeal metabolites linking to different lineages that might influence the tumor microenvironment and carcinogenesis. These results could open a new door to the guidance of diagnosing cancer and developing new treatment strategies.

There is increasing evidence that the airway microbiome plays a key role in the establishment of respiratory health by interacting with the developing immune system early in life. While it has become clear that bacteria are involved in this process, there is a knowledge gap concerning the role of fungi. Moreover, the inter-kingdom interactions that influence immune development remain unknown. In this prospective exploratory human study, we aimed to determine early post-natal microbial and immunological features of the upper airways in 121 healthy newborns.

## Altered gut metabolites and microbiota interactions are implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis and can be non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers.
 25.02.2022, _OO Coker, C Liu, WKK Wu, SH Wong, W Jia, JJY Sung, J Yu_


Gut microbiota contributes to colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis through microbes and their metabolites. The importance of microbiota-associated metabolites in colorectal carcinogenesis highlights the need to investigate the gut metabolome along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence to determine their mechanistic implications in the pathogenesis of CRC. To date, how and which microbes and metabolites interactively promote early events of CRC development are still largely unclear. We aim to determine gut microbiota-associated metabolites and their linkage to colorectal carcinogenesis.

Establishing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to prevent multifactorial diarrhea in calves is challenging because of the differences in farm management practices, the lack of optimal donors, and recipient selection. In this study, the underlying factors of successful and unsuccessful FMT treatment cases are elucidated, and the potential markers for predicting successful FMT are identified using fecal metagenomics via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, fecal metabolomics via capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and machine learning approaches.

## Core arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are predicted by their high abundance-occupancy relationship while host-specific taxa are rare and geographically structured.
 26.02.2022, _KT Kajihara, CP Egan, SOI Swift, CB Wall, CD Muir, NA Hynson_


Habitat restoration may depend on the recovery of plant microbial symbionts such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, but this requires a better understanding of the rules that govern their community assembly. We examined the interactions of soil and host-associated AM fungal communities between remnant and restored patches of subtropical montane forests. While AM fungal richness did not differ between habitat types, community membership did and was influenced by geography, habitat and host. These differences were largely driven by rare host-specific AM fungi that displayed near-complete turnover between forest types, while core AM fungal taxa were highly abundant and ubiquitous. Remnant forest bipartite networks were more specialized and hosts more specific than in the restored forest. Host-associated AM fungal communities nested within soil communities in both habitats, but only significantly so in the restored forest. Our results provide evidence that restored and remnant forests harbor the same core fungal symbionts, while rare host-specific taxa differ, and that geography, host identity and taxonomic resolution strongly affect the observed distribution patterns of these fungi. We suggest that host-specific interactions with AM fungi as well as spatial processes should be explicitly considered to effectively reestablish target host and symbiont communities.

## Embracing mountain microbiome and ecosystem functions under global change.
 25.02.2022, _J Wang, A Hu, F Meng, W Zhao, Y Yang, J Soininen, J Shen, J Zhou_


Mountains are pivotal to maintaining habitat heterogeneity, global biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services to humans. They have provided classic model natural systems for plant and animal diversity gradient studies for over 250 years. In the recent decade, exploration of microorganisms on mountainsides has also achieved substantial progresses. Here, we review the literature on microbial diversity across taxonomic groups and ecosystem types on global mountains. Microbial community shows climatic zonation with orderly successions along elevational gradients, which are largely consistent with traditional climatic hypotheses. However, elevational patterns are complicated for species richness without general rules in terrestrial and aquatic environments and are driven mainly by deterministic processes caused by abiotic and biotic factors. We see a major shift from documenting patterns of biodiversity towards identifying the mechanisms that shape microbial biogeographical patterns and how these patterns vary under global change by inclusion of novel ecological theories, frameworks and approaches. We thus propose key questions and cutting-edge perspectives to advance future research in mountain microbial biogeography by focusing on biodiversity hypotheses, incorporating meta-ecosystem framework and novel key drivers, adapting recently developed approaches in trait-based ecology and manipulative field experiments, disentangling biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, and finally modelling and predicting their global change responses.

## Nitrogen fertilization disrupts the temporal dynamics of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae but not spore density and community composition in a wheat field.
 18.02.2022, _BJ Babalola, J Li, CE Willing, Y Zheng, YL Wang, HY Gan, XC Li, C Wang, CA Adams, C Gao, LD Guo_


Elucidating the temporal dynamics of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is critical for understanding their functions. Furthermore, research investigating the temporal dynamics of AM fungi in response to agricultural practices remain in its infancy. We investigated the effect of nitrogen fertilization and watering reduction on the temporal dynamics of AM fungi, across the lifespan of wheat. Nitrogen fertilization decreased AM fungal spore density, extra-radical hyphal density, and intra-radical colonization rate in both watering conditions. Nitrogen fertilization affected AM fungal community composition in soil but not in roots, regardless of watering conditions. The temporal analysis revealed that AM fungal extra-radical hyphal density and intra-radical colonization rate were higher under conventional watering and lower under reduced watering in March than in other growth stages at low (≤ 70 kg N ha-1 yr-1 ) but not at high (≥ 140) nitrogen fertilization levels. AM fungal spore density was lower in June than in other growth stages and community composition varied with plant development at all nitrogen fertilization levels, regardless of watering conditions. This study demonstrates that high nitrogen fertilization levels disrupt the temporal dynamics of AM fungal hyphal growth but not sporulation and community composition.

## Multiomics Reveals the Effect of Root Rot on Polygonati Rhizome and Identifies Pathogens and Biocontrol Strain.
 28.02.2022, _Z Pang, X Mao, Y Xia, J Xiao, X Wang, P Xu, G Liu_


Root (rhizome) rot of Polygonatum plants has received substantial attention because it threatens yield and sustainable utilization in the polygonati rhizome industry. However, the potential pathogens that cause rhizome rot as well as the direct and indirect (via root-associated microbes) strategies by which Polygonatum defends against pathogens remain largely unknown. Herein, we used integrated multiomics of plant-targeted metabolomics and transcriptomics, microbiome, and culture-based methods to systematically investigate the interactions between the Polygonatum cyrtonema Hua root-associated microbiota and pathogens. We found that root rot inhibited P. cyrtonema rhizome growth and that the fresh weight significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.001). The transcriptomic and metabonomic results showed that the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to specialized metabolic and systemic resistance pathways, such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and flavonoid biosynthesis, cycloartenol synthase activity (related to saponin synthesis), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and plant hormone signal transduction, was particularly increased in diseased rhizomes. Consistently, the contents of lactose, d-fructose, sarsasapogenin, asperulosidic acid, botulin, myricadoil, and other saponins, which are functional medicinal compounds present in P. cyrtonema rhizomes, were also increased in diseased plants infected with rhizome rot. The microbiome sequencing and culture results showed that root rot disrupted the P. cyrtonema bacterial and fungal communities and reduced the microbial diversity in the rhizomes and rhizosphere soil. We further found that a clear enrichment of Streptomyces violascens XTBG45 (HJB-XTBG45) in the healthy rhizosphere could control the root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum spaethianum. Taken together, our results indicate that P. cyrtonema can modulate the plant immune system and metabolic processes and enrich beneficial root microbiota to defend against pathogens. IMPORTANCE Root (rhizome or tuber) reproduction is the main method for the agricultural cultivation of many important cash crops, and infected crop plants rot, exhibit retarded growth, and experience yield losses. While many studies have investigated medicinal plants and their functional medicinal compounds, the occurrence of root (rhizome) rot of plant and soil microbiota has received little attention. Therefore, we used integrated multiomics and culture-based methods to systematically study rhizome rot on the famous Chinese medicine Polygonatum cyrtonema and identify pathogens and beneficial microbiota of rhizome rot. Rhizome rot disrupted the Polygonatum-associated microbiota and reduced microbial diversity, and rhizome transcription and metabolic processes significantly changed. Our work provides evidence that rhizome rot not only changes rhizome transcription and functional metabolite contents but also impacts the microbial community diversity, assembly, and function of the rhizome and rhizosphere. This study provides a new friendly strategy for medicinal plant breeding and agricultural utilization.

## Seed microbiota revealed by a large-scale meta-analysis including 50 plant species.
 17.02.2022, _M Simonin, M Briand, G Chesneau, A Rochefort, C Marais, A Sarniguet, M Barret_


Seed microbiota constitutes a primary inoculum for plants that is gaining attention due to its role for plant health and productivity. Here, we performed a meta-analysis on 63 seed microbiota studies covering 50 plant species to synthesize knowledge on the diversity of this habitat. Seed microbiota are diverse and extremely variable, with taxa richness varying from one to thousands of taxa. Hence, seed microbiota presents a variable (i.e flexible) microbial fraction but we also identified a stable (i.e. core) fraction across samples. Around 30 bacterial and fungal taxa are present in most plant species and in samples from all over the world. Core taxa, such as Pantoea agglomerans, Pseudomonas viridiflava, P. fluorescens, Cladosporium perangustum and Alternaria sp., are dominant seed taxa. The characterization of the core and flexible seed microbiota provided here will help uncover seed microbiota roles for plant health and design effective microbiome engineering.

## "Boom-and-busted-dynamics" of phytoplankton-virus interactions explain the paradox of the plankton.
 18.02.2022, _KJ Flynn, A Mitra, WH Wilson, SA Kimmance, DR Clark, A Pelusi, L Polimene_


(1) Rapid virus proliferation can strongly control phytoplankton host populations, playing a significant role in marine biogeochemistry and ecology. We explore how marine lytic viruses impact phytoplankton succession affecting host and non-host populations. (2) Using an in silico food-web we conducted simulation experiments under a range of different abiotic and biotic conditions exploring the interplay between virus-host-grazer, with competition, allometry, motility and cyst cycles. (3) Interactions between virus-host, predator-prey and competitors generate bloom dynamics with a pronounced boom-and-busted-dynamic (BBeD) which sees suppression of erstwhile successful phytoplankton species. BBeD is decreased at low nutrient loading through distancing of phytoplankton hosts, while high sediment loading and non-host biomass decrease viruses through adsorption. Larger hosts are inherently more distanced but motility increases virus attack, while cyst cycles promote spatial and temporal distancing. (4) Virus control of phytoplankton bloom development appears more important than virus-induced termination of those blooms. This affects plankton succession, not only the growth of species infected by the virus, but also those others that compete for the same resource and are collectively subjected to common grazer control. The role of viruses in structuring plankton communities via BBeD can thus provide an explanation for the paradox of the plankton.

## Global 16S rRNA diversity of provannid snail endosymbionts from Indo-Pacific deep-sea hydrothermal vents.
 16.02.2022, _C Breusing, J Castel, Y Yang, T Broquet, J Sun, D Jollivet, PY Qian, RA Beinart_


Symbioses between invertebrate animals and chemosynthetic bacteria build the foundation of deep-sea hydrothermal ecosystems worldwide. Despite the importance of these symbioses for ecosystem functioning, the diversity of symbionts within and between host organisms and geographic regions is still poorly understood. In this study we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine the diversity of gill endosymbionts in provannid snails of the genera Alviniconcha and Ifremeria, which are key species at deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Our analysis of 761 snail samples across the distributional range of these species confirms previous findings that symbiont lineages are strongly partitioned by host species and broad-scale geography. Less structuring was observed within geographic regions, probably due to insufficient strain resolution of the 16S rRNA gene. Symbiont richness in individual hosts appeared to be unrelated to host size, suggesting that provannid snails might acquire their symbionts only during a permissive time window in early developmental stages in contrast to other vent molluscs that obtain their symbionts throughout their lifetime. Despite the extent of our dataset, symbiont accumulation curves did not reach saturation, highlighting the need for increased sampling efforts to uncover the full diversity of symbionts within these and other hydrothermal vent species.

## Sources of protein diet differentially stimulate the gut and water microbiota under freshwater crayfish, marron (Cherax cainii, Austin 2002) culture.
 07.02.2022, _MJ Foysal, TTT Dao, R Fotedar, SK Gupta, A Tay, MR Chaklader_


To reduce the reliance on fishmeal (FM), other protein sources have been evaluated on cultured animals. In a 60-days feeding trial, marrons (Cherax cainii) were fed a FM diet and five test diets containing 100% of plant-based protein sources such as soybean, lupin and valorised animal-based proteins such as poultry-by-product, black soldier fly and tuna hydrolysate. At the end of the trial, DNA samples from marron gut and rearing water were investigated through DNA-based 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Plant-based diets increased abundance for Aeromonas, Flavobacterium and Vogesella, whereas animal and insect proteins influenced diverse bacterial groups in the gut linked to various metabolic activities. Insect meal in the water favoured the growth of Firmicutes and lactic acid bacteria, beneficial for the marron health. Aeromonas richness in the gut and reared water signified the ubiquitous nature of the genus in the environment. The higher bacterial diversity in the gut and water with PBP and BSF was further supported by qPCR quantification of the bacterial single-copy gene, rpoB. The overall results suggested that PBP and BSF can exhibit positive and influential effects on the gut and water microbial communities, hence can be used as sustainable ingredients for the crayfish aquaculture.
