This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

Epilepsy stands out as one of the most prevalent neurological conditions. Brivaracetam (BRV) is a noteworthy antiseizure medication (ASM) distinguished by its pronounced and selective interaction with the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) within the brain. Prior investigations, including regulatory trials, post-marketing assessments, and comparative meta-analyses, have consistently underscored BRV's equivalency in efficacy and superior tolerability when pitted against other antiseizure drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of BRV in treating epileptic patients in the Pakistani population.

## Cholesterol lowering in diet-induced hypercholesterolemic mice using Lactobacillus bile salt hydrolases with different substrate specificities.
 11.01.2024, _M Zhao, W Kuang, J Yang, Y Liu, M Yang, Y Chen, H Zhu, Y Yang_


The cholesterol-lowering effect of lactic acid bacteria with high activity of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) is unclear. We believe that distinguishing BSH substrate specificity is necessary to study the effect of various BSH enzymes. We engineered a BSH mutant enzyme recombinant strain named F67A, which exclusively hydrolyzes taurocholic acid (TCA) using site-directed mutagenesis, and a previously lab-constructed BSH recombinant strain, YB81 that exclusively hydrolyzes glycocholic acid (GCA). We also constructed the recombinant strain named NB5462, which carries the empty pSIP411 plasmid and was used as a blank control strain. The intestinal flora in pseudo-germ-free (PGF) mice in which intestinal flora were eliminated via antibiotics, and F67A successfully reduced serum cholesterol levels in high-cholesterol diet-fed mice, whereas YB81 did not yield the same results. However, YB81 regained its cholesterol-lowering capacity in specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice with intact intestinal flora. The cholesterol-lowering mechanism of F67A involved modifying the bile acid pool through BSH enzyme activity. This adjustment regulated the expression of intestinal farnesoid X receptor and subsequently elevated hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), effectively reducing cholesterol levels. Conversely, GCA, the substrate of YB81, was found in minimal quantities in mice, preventing it from inducing changes in bile acid pools. In the presence of intestinal flora, the YB81 BSH enzyme induced notable alterations in bile acids by regulating changes in the intestinal flora and BSH within the flora, ultimately resulting in cholesterol reduction. This is the first study investigating the substrate specificity of BSH, demonstrating that different substrate-specific BSH enzymes exhibit cholesterol-lowering properties. Additionally, we elaborate on the mechanism of BSH-mediated enterohepatic axis regulation.

## Regulations and Funding to Create Enterprise Architecture for a Nationwide Health Data Ecosystem.
 11.01.2024, _G Seidman, A AlKasir, K Ricker, JT Lane, AB Zink, MA Williams_


The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the United States' lack of a nationwide infrastructure for collecting, sharing, and using health data, especially for secondary uses (e.g., population health management and public health). The federal government is taking several important steps to upgrade the nation's health data ecosystem-notably, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Data Modernization Initiative and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology's Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement. However, substantial barriers remain. Inconsistent regulations, infrastructure, and governance across federal and state levels and between states significantly impede the exchange and analysis of health data. Siloed systems and insufficient funding block effective integration of clinical, public health, and social determinants data within and between states. In this analytic essay, we propose strategies to develop a nationwide health data ecosystem. We focus on providing federal guidance and incentives to develop state-designated entities responsible for the collection, integration, and analysis of clinical, public health, social determinants of health, claims, administrative, and other relevant data. These recommendations include a regulatory clearinghouse, federal guidance, model legislation and templated regulation, funding to incentive enterprise architecture, regulatory sandboxes, and a 3-pronged research agenda.

_Infant, Newborn, Adult, Humans, Bilirubin, Urobilinogen, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Liver, Bacteria_
Metabolism of haem by-products such as bilirubin by humans and their gut microbiota is essential to human health, as excess serum bilirubin can cause jaundice and even neurological damage. The bacterial enzymes that reduce bilirubin to urobilinogen, a key step in this pathway, have remained unidentified. Here we used biochemical analyses and comparative genomics to identify BilR as a gut-microbiota-derived bilirubin reductase that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen. We delineated the BilR sequences from similar reductases through the identification of key residues critical for bilirubin reduction and found that BilR is predominantly encoded by Firmicutes species. Analysis of human gut metagenomes revealed that BilR is nearly ubiquitous in healthy adults, but prevalence is decreased in neonates and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. This discovery sheds light on the role of the gut microbiome in bilirubin metabolism and highlights the significance of the gut-liver axis in maintaining bilirubin homeostasis.

Establishing the infant's gut microbiota has long-term implications on health and immunity. Breastfeeding is recognized as the best practice of infant nutrition in comparison with formula feeding. We evaluated the effects of the primary feeding practices by analyzing the infant growth and the potential association with gut diseases. A cross-sectional and observational study was designed. This study included 55 mothers with infants, who were divided according to their feeding practices in breastfeeding (BF), formula feeding (FF), and combined breast and formula feeding (CF). Anthropometric measurements of the participants were recorded. Additionally, non-invasive fecal samples from the infants were collected to analyze the microbiota by sequencing, immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration (ELISA), and volatile organic compounds (gas chromatography with an electronic nose). Results showed that the microbiota diversity in the BF group was the highest compared to the other two groups. The IgA levels in the BF group were twice as high as those in the FF group. Moreover, the child´s growth in the BF group showed the best infant development when the data were compared at birth to the recollection time, as noted by the correlation with a decreased concentration of toxic volatile organic compounds. Interestingly, the CF group showed a significant difference in health status when the data were compared with the FF group. We conclude that early health practices influence children's growth, which is relevant to further research about how those infants' health evolved.

Aquaculture plays an important role in global protein supplies and food security. The ban on antibiotics as feed additive proposes urgent need to develop alternatives. Gut microbiota plays important roles in the metabolism and immunity of fish and has the potential to give rise to novel solutions for challenges confronted by fish culture. However, our understanding of fish gut microbiome is still lacking.

The observation that the intestinal microbiota is central in the development of IBD suggests that dietary fiber, the microbiota's primary source of nourishment, could play a central role in these diseases. Accordingly, enriching diets with specific soluble fibers remodels microbiota and modulates colitis sensitivity. In humans, a recent study suggests that the microbiota of select IBD patients might influence the impacts they would experience upon fiber exposure. We sought here to define the extent to which individual microbiotas varied in their responsiveness to purified soluble fiber inulin and psyllium. Moreover, the extent to which such variance might impact proneness to colitis.

The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.

The human microbiome contributes to health and disease, but the oral microbiota is understudied relative to the gut microbiota. The salivary microbiota is easily accessible, underexplored, and may provide insight into response to infections. We sought to determine the composition, association with clinical features, and heterogeneity of the salivary microbiota in patients with acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). We conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study of 147 adults with acute LRTI presenting to the emergency department of seven hospitals in three states (Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio) between May 2017 and November 2018. Salivary samples were collected in the emergency department, at days 2-5 if hospitalized, and at day 30, as well as fecal samples if patients were willing. We compared salivary microbiota profiles from patients to those of healthy adult volunteers by sequencing and analyzing bacterial 16-rRNA. Compared to healthy volunteers, the salivary microbiota of patients with LRTI was highly distinct and strongly enriched with intestinal anaerobes such as Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae (e.g., mean 10% relative abundance of Bacteroides vs &lt; 1% in healthy volunteers). Within the LRTI population, COPD exacerbation was associated with altered salivary microbiota composition compared to other LRTI conditions. The largest determinant of microbiota variation within the LRTI population was geography (city in which the hospital was located).

Nanodecoy systems based on analogues of viral cellular receptors assembled onto fluid lipid-based membranes of nano/extravescicles are potential new tools to complement classic therapeutic or preventive antiviral approaches. The need for lipid-based membranes for transmembrane receptor anchorage may pose technical challenges along industrial translation, calling for alternative geometries for receptor multimerization. Here we developed a semisynthetic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanodecoy by multimerizing the biotin labelled virus cell receptor -ACE2- ectodomain onto a poly-avidin nanoparticle (NP) based on the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly-ANANAS. The ability of the assembly to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and the affinity of the ACE2:viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction were measured at different ACE2:NP ratios. At ACE2:NP = 30, 90 % SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition at ACE2 nanomolar concentration was registered on both Wuhan and Omicron variants, with ten-fold higher potency than the monomeric protein. Lower and higher ACE2 densities were less efficient suggesting that functional recognition between multi-ligand NPs and multi-receptor virus surfaces requires optimal geometrical relationships. In vivo studies in mice showed that the biodistribution and safety profiles of the nanodecoy are potentially suitable for preventing viral infection upon nasal instillation. Viral receptor multimerization using ANANAS is a convenient process which, in principle, could be rapidly adapted to counteract also other viral infections.

The rhizosheath, a cohesive soil layer firmly adhering to plant roots, plays a vital role in facilitating water and mineral uptake. In pearl millet, rhizosheath formation is genetically controlled and influenced by root exudates. Here, we investigated the impact of root exudates on the microbiota composition, interactions, and assembly processes, and rhizosheath structure in pearl millet using four distinct lines with contrasting soil aggregation abilities.

Metagenomics has enabled the comprehensive study of microbiomes. However, many applications would benefit from a method that sequences specific bacterial taxa of interest, but not most background taxa. We developed mEnrich-seq (in which 'm' stands for methylation and seq for sequencing) for enriching taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self versus nonself differentiation by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, individually or in combination, to deplete host and background taxa while enriching targeted taxa. This idea is integrated with library preparation procedures and applied in several applications to enrich (up to 117-fold) pathogenic or beneficial bacteria from human urine and fecal samples, including species that are hard to culture or of low abundance. We assessed 4,601 bacterial strains with mapped methylomes so far and showed broad applicability of mEnrich-seq. mEnrich-seq provides microbiome researchers with a versatile and cost-effective approach for selective sequencing of diverse taxa of interest.

Diverse host factors drive microbial variation in plant-associated environments, whereas their genetic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. To address this, we coupled the analyses of plant genetics and microbiomes in this study. Using 100 tea plant (Camellia sinensis) cultivars, the microbiomes of rhizosphere, root endosphere and phyllosphere showed clear compartment-specific assembly, whereas the subpopulation differentiation of tea cultivars exhibited small effects on microbial variation in each compartment. Through microbiome genome-wide association studies, we examined the interactions between tea genetic loci and microbial variation. Notably, genes related to the cell wall and carbon catabolism were heavily linked to root endosphere microbial composition, whereas genes related to the metabolism of metal ions and small organic molecules were overrepresented in association with rhizosphere microbial composition. Moreover, a set of tea genetic variants, including the cytoskeleton-related formin homology interacting protein 1 gene, were strongly associated with the β-diversity of phyllosphere microbiomes, implying their interactions with the overall structure of microbial communities. Our results create a catalogue of tea genetic determinants interacting with microbiomes and reveal the compartment-specific microbiome assembly driven by host genetics.

## Democratizing Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Data: Examining Community Accessibility of Data for Health and the Social Drivers of Health.

Making data accessible to communities is essential for developing community-driven solutions to address health inequities. In this analytic essay, we highlight the importance of democratizing data for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs)-diverse populations that historically have had little access to their data-in the context of achieving equity in health and the social drivers of health. We provide a framework for evaluating community accessibility of data, which includes concepts of data availability, salience, cost, and report back. We apply the framework to evaluate community accessibility of NHPI data from 29 federal data sources. In addition, we provide results from a survey of NHPI-serving community organizations in California conducted from December 2021 to February 2022 to assess community data needs. Findings reveal federal gaps in data accessibility, as well as NHPI community organizational needs for increased data accessibility, data saliency, and technical capacity. Furthermore, organization leads expressed concerns about data privacy, security, and misuse. We provide recommendations for data custodians to improve accessibility of timely, accurate, and robust data to support NHPI communities.
