## Genetic association between gut microbiome and blood pressure and blood cell count as mediator: A two-step Mendelian randomization analysis.
 18.05.2024, _J Zhang, J He, Y Liao, X Xia, F Yang_


Previous studies have established a genetic link between gut microbiota and hypertension, but whether blood cell count plays a mediating role in this remains unknown. This study aims to explore genetic associations and causal factors involving the gut microbiome, peripheral blood cell count, and blood pressure.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy in childbearing-age females which can cause many complications, such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. The metabolic disorders in patients with PCOS were linked to gut microbial dysbiosis. However, the correlation between the gut microbial community and dyslipidemia in PCOS remains unillustrated. Our study elucidated the different gut microbiota in patients with PCOS and dyslipidemia (PCOS.D) compared to those with only PCOS and healthy women.

## Comparative microbiome analysis in cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

Bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by abnormal and irreversible bronchial dilation resulting from lung tissue damage and can be categorized into two main groups: cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB). Both diseases are marked by recurrent infections, inflammatory exacerbations, and lung damage. Given that infections are the primary drivers of disease progression, characterization of the respiratory microbiome can shed light on compositional alterations and susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs in these cases compared to healthy individuals.

## Quantitative analysis of the effects of brushing, flossing, and mouthrinsing on supragingival and subgingival plaque microbiota: 12-week clinical trial.

Translational microbiome research using next-generation DNA sequencing is challenging due to the semi-qualitative nature of relative abundance data. A novel method for quantitative analysis was applied in this 12-week clinical trial to understand the mechanical vs. chemotherapeutic actions of brushing, flossing, and mouthrinsing against the supragingival dental plaque microbiome. Enumeration of viable bacteria using vPCR was also applied on supragingival plaque for validation and on subgingival plaque to evaluate interventional effects below the gingival margin.

## Exploring the skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis and disease modification.
 18.05.2024, _C Hülpüsch, R Rohayem, M Reiger, C Traidl-Hoffmann_


Inflammatory skin diseases, like atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis, AD), affect children and adults globally. In AD, the skin barrier is impaired on multiple levels. Underlying factors include genetic, chemical, immunological, and microbial components. Increased skin pH in AD is part of the altered microbial microenvironment that promotes overgrowth of the skin microbiome with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The secretion of virulence factors, like toxins and proteases, by S. aureus further aggravates the skin barrier deficiency and additionally off-balances the already skewed immune response. Skin commensal bacteria, however, can inhibit the growth and pathogenicity of S. aureus through quorum sensing systems. Therefore, restoring a healthy skin microbiome could contribute to remission induction in AD. This review discusses direct and indirect approaches to targeting the skin microbiome through modulation of the skin pH, UV treatment, and pre-, pro-, and postbiotics. Furthermore, exploratory techniques like skin microbiome transplantation, ozone therapy, and phage therapy are discussed. Finally, we summarize the latest findings on disease and microbiome modification through targeted immunomodulatory, systemic treatments and biologicals. We believe that targeting the skin microbiome should be considered a crucial component of successful AD treatment in the future.

## Isobutyric acid enhances the anti-tumour effect of anti-PD-1 antibody.

The low response rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is a challenge. The efficacy of ICIs is influenced by the tumour microenvironment, which is controlled by the gut microbiota. In particular, intestinal bacteria and their metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are important regulators of cancer immunity; however, our knowledge on the effects of individual SCFAs remains limited. Here, we show that isobutyric acid has the strongest effect among SCFAs on both immune activity and tumour growth. In vitro, cancer cell numbers were suppressed by approximately 75% in humans and mice compared with those in controls. Oral administration of isobutyric acid to carcinoma-bearing mice enhanced the effect of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, reducing tumour volume by approximately 80% and 60% compared with those in the control group and anti-PD-1 antibody alone group, respectively. Taken together, these findings may support the development of novel cancer therapies that can improve the response rate to ICIs.
