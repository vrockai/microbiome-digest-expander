This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Sex differences in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity: the role of the gut microbiome.
 10.01.2024, _S Stapleton, G Welch, L DiBerardo, LR Freeman_


Recent decades have seen an exponential rise in global obesity prevalence, with rates nearly doubling in a span of 40 years. A comprehensive knowledge base regarding the systemic effects of obesity is required to create new preventative and therapeutic agents effective at combating the current obesity epidemic. Previous studies of diet-induced obesity utilizing mouse models have demonstrated a difference in bodyweight gain by sex. In such studies, female mice gained significantly less weight than male mice when given the same high fat (HF) diet, indicating a resistance to diet-induced obesity. Research has also shown sex differences in gut microbiome composition between males and females, indicated to be in part a result of sex hormones. Understanding metabolic differences between sexes could assist in the development of new measures for obesity prevention and treatment. This study aimed to characterize sex differences in weight gain, plasma lipid profiles, fecal microbiota composition, and fecal short chain fatty acid levels. We hypothesized a role for the gut microbiome in these sex differences that would be normalized following microbiome depletion.

## Core and variable antimicrobial resistance genes in the gut microbiomes of Chinese and European pigs.
 10.01.2024, _CH Tong, ZP Huo, L Diao, DY Xiao, RN Zhao, ZL Zeng, WG Xiong_


Monitoring the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) is vital for addressing the global crisis of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Despite its importance, the characterization of ARGs and microbiome structures, as well as the identification of indicators for routine ARG monitoring in pig farms, are still lacking, particularly concerning variations in antimicrobial exposure in different countries or regions. Here, metagenomics and random forest machine learning were used to elucidate the ARG profiles, microbiome structures, and ARG contamination indicators in pig manure under different antimicrobial pressures between China and Europe. Results showed that Chinese pigs exposed to high-level antimicrobials exhibited higher total and plasmid-mediated ARG abundances compared to those in European pigs ( P&lt;0.05). ANT(6)-Ib, APH(3')-IIIa, and tet(40) were identified as shared core ARGs between the two pig populations. Furthermore, the core ARGs identified in pig populations were correlated with those found in human populations within the same geographical regions. Lactobacillus and Prevotella were identified as the dominant genera in the core microbiomes of Chinese and European pigs, respectively. Forty ARG markers and 43 biomarkers were able to differentiate between the Chinese and European pig manure samples with accuracies of 100% and 98.7%, respectively. Indicators for assessing ARG contamination in Chinese and European pigs also achieved high accuracy ( r=0.72-0.88). Escherichia flexneri in both Chinese and European pig populations carried between 21 and 37 ARGs. The results of this study emphasize the importance of global collaboration in reducing antimicrobial resistance risk and provide validated indicators for evaluating the risk of ARG contamination in pig farms.

Metabolism of haem by-products such as bilirubin by humans and their gut microbiota is essential to human health, as excess serum bilirubin can cause jaundice and even neurological damage. The bacterial enzymes that reduce bilirubin to urobilinogen, a key step in this pathway, have remained unidentified. Here we used biochemical analyses and comparative genomics to identify BilR as a gut-microbiota-derived bilirubin reductase that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen. We delineated the BilR sequences from similar reductases through the identification of key residues critical for bilirubin reduction and found that BilR is predominantly encoded by Firmicutes species. Analysis of human gut metagenomes revealed that BilR is nearly ubiquitous in healthy adults, but prevalence is decreased in neonates and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. This discovery sheds light on the role of the gut microbiome in bilirubin metabolism and highlights the significance of the gut-liver axis in maintaining bilirubin homeostasis.

Establishing the infant's gut microbiota has long-term implications on health and immunity. Breastfeeding is recognized as the best practice of infant nutrition in comparison with formula feeding. We evaluated the effects of the primary feeding practices by analyzing the infant growth and the potential association with gut diseases. A cross-sectional and observational study was designed. This study included 55 mothers with infants, who were divided according to their feeding practices in breastfeeding (BF), formula feeding (FF), and combined breast and formula feeding (CF). Anthropometric measurements of the participants were recorded. Additionally, non-invasive fecal samples from the infants were collected to analyze the microbiota by sequencing, immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration (ELISA), and volatile organic compounds (gas chromatography with an electronic nose). Results showed that the microbiota diversity in the BF group was the highest compared to the other two groups. The IgA levels in the BF group were twice as high as those in the FF group. Moreover, the child´s growth in the BF group showed the best infant development when the data were compared at birth to the recollection time, as noted by the correlation with a decreased concentration of toxic volatile organic compounds. Interestingly, the CF group showed a significant difference in health status when the data were compared with the FF group. We conclude that early health practices influence children's growth, which is relevant to further research about how those infants' health evolved.

## Individualized microbiotas dictate the impact of dietary fiber on colitis sensitivity.

The observation that the intestinal microbiota is central in the development of IBD suggests that dietary fiber, the microbiota's primary source of nourishment, could play a central role in these diseases. Accordingly, enriching diets with specific soluble fibers remodels microbiota and modulates colitis sensitivity. In humans, a recent study suggests that the microbiota of select IBD patients might influence the impacts they would experience upon fiber exposure. We sought here to define the extent to which individual microbiotas varied in their responsiveness to purified soluble fiber inulin and psyllium. Moreover, the extent to which such variance might impact proneness to colitis.

## A unified compendium of prokaryotic and viral genomes from over 300 anaerobic digestion microbiomes.
 05.01.2024, _VB Centurion, A Rossi, E Orellana, G Ghiotto, B Kakuk, MS Morlino, A Basile, G Zampieri, L Treu, S Campanaro_


The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.

## Larger hydroxyapatite aggregation from Ca2+ adhesion in ANAMMOX granular sludge caused by high dissolved oxygen.
 10.01.2024, _M Yuan, Q Shan, M Fu, M Deng, J Wang, F Deng_


Anaerobic ammonia oxidation (ANAMMOX) -a sustainable biological process-is promising to remove NH4+-N from municipal sewage. In this study, results showed that the anammox granular sludge morphology changes with the alternation of dissolved oxygen (DO), mainly attributing to the adhesion of calcium ions (Ca2+) to the surface of sludge particles. Diverse characterization methods revealed that gray adhesions in the form of hydroxyapatite covered the original holes on the anammox granular sludge surface, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), digital camera images, Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Ex-situ degradation of NH4+-N and NO2--N yielded diverse outcomes. The protein to polysaccharide ratio (PN/PS) in the total extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) across 4 size groups demonstrated a decrease under O2 exposure. Microbial community analysis indicated norank_f_A4b and Nitrolancea being the most abundant genus under O2 exposure at day 1 and day 100, respectively. These findings offer an effective strategy to prevent size-larger granular sludge from deteriorating through changing DO and Ca2+ in municipal wastewater in ANAMMOX.

Nanodecoy systems based on analogues of viral cellular receptors assembled onto fluid lipid-based membranes of nano/extravescicles are potential new tools to complement classic therapeutic or preventive antiviral approaches. The need for lipid-based membranes for transmembrane receptor anchorage may pose technical challenges along industrial translation, calling for alternative geometries for receptor multimerization. Here we developed a semisynthetic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanodecoy by multimerizing the biotin labelled virus cell receptor -ACE2- ectodomain onto a poly-avidin nanoparticle (NP) based on the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly-ANANAS. The ability of the assembly to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and the affinity of the ACE2:viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction were measured at different ACE2:NP ratios. At ACE2:NP = 30, 90 % SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition at ACE2 nanomolar concentration was registered on both Wuhan and Omicron variants, with ten-fold higher potency than the monomeric protein. Lower and higher ACE2 densities were less efficient suggesting that functional recognition between multi-ligand NPs and multi-receptor virus surfaces requires optimal geometrical relationships. In vivo studies in mice showed that the biodistribution and safety profiles of the nanodecoy are potentially suitable for preventing viral infection upon nasal instillation. Viral receptor multimerization using ANANAS is a convenient process which, in principle, could be rapidly adapted to counteract also other viral infections.
