The imbalance of commensal bacteria is called dysbiosis in intestinal microflora. Secreted IgA in the intestinal lumen plays an important role in the regulation of microbiota. Although dysbiosis of gut bacteria is reported in IBD patients, it remains unclear what makes dysbiosis of their microflora. The intervention method for remedy of dysbiosis in IBD patients is not well established. In this study, we focused on the quality of human endogenous IgA and investigated whether mouse monoclonal IgA which binds to selectively colitogenic bacteria can modulate human gut microbiota with IBD patients.

Pancreatic cancer, specifically pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), continues to pose a significant clinical and scientific challenge. The most significant finding of recent years is that PDAC tumours harbour their specific microbiome, which differs amongst tumour entities and is distinct from healthy tissue. This review aims to evaluate and summarise all PDAC studies that have used the next-generation technique, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing within each bodily compartment. As well as establishing a causal relationship between PDAC and the microbiome.

This cross-sectional study investigated differences in the plasma metabolome in two groups of adults that were of similar age but varied markedly in body composition and dietary and physical activity patterns. Study participants included 52 adults in the lifestyle group (LIFE) (28 males, 24 females) and 52 in the control group (CON) (27 males, 25 females). The results using an extensive untargeted ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) metabolomics analysis with 10,535 metabolite peaks identified 486 important metabolites (variable influence on projections scores of VIP ≥ 1) and 16 significantly enriched metabolic pathways that differentiated LIFE and CON groups. A novel metabolite signature of positive lifestyle habits emerged from this analysis highlighted by lower plasma levels of numerous bile acids, an amino acid profile characterized by higher histidine and lower glutamic acid, glutamine, β-alanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and proline, an elevated vitamin D status, higher levels of beneficial fatty acids and gut microbiome catabolism metabolites from plant substrates, and reduced levels of N-glycan degradation metabolites and environmental contaminants. This study established that the plasma metabolome is strongly associated with body composition and lifestyle habits. The robust lifestyle metabolite signature identified in this study is consistent with an improved life expectancy and a reduced risk for chronic disease.

To explore the differences of vaginal microbes in women with preterm birth (PTB), and to construct prediction model. We searched for articles related to vaginal microbiology in preterm women and obtained four 16S rRNA-sequence datasets. We analyzed that for species diversity and differences, and constructed a random forest model with 20 differential genera. We introduce an independent whole genome-sequencing (WGS) data for validation. In addition, we collected vaginal and cervical swabs from 33 pregnant women who delivered spontaneously full-term and preterm infants, performed WGS in our lab to further validate the model. Compared to term birth (TB) samples, PTB women vagina were characterized by a decrease in Firmicutes, Lactobacillus, and an increase in diversity accompanied by the colonization of pathogenic bacteria such as Gardnerella, Atopobium and Prevotella. Twenty genus markers, including Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Streptococcus, and Gardnerella performed well in predicting PTB, with study-to-study transfer validation and LODO validation, different gestation validation showing good results, and in two independent cohorts (external WGS cohorts and woman samples WGS cohorts) in which the accuracy was maintained. PTB women have unique vaginal microbiota characteristics. A predictive model of PTB was constructed and its value validated from multiple perspectives.

Despite modern antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH) have increased relative risk of inflammatory-driven comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). The gut microbiome could be one of several driving factors, along with traditional risk factors and HIV-related risk factors such as coinfections, ART toxicity, and past immunodeficiency.

## Vaginal microbiota and gynecological cancers: a complex and evolving relationship.
 18.06.2024, _K Javadi, E Ferdosi-Shahandashti, M Rajabnia, M Khaledi_


The vagina hosts a community of microorganisms known as the vaginal microbiota. This community is relatively stable and straightforward, with Lactobacillus species being the most dominant members. The vaginal microbiota has various functions that are essential for maintaining human health and balance. For example, it can metabolise dietary nutrients, produce growth factors, communicate with other bacteria, modulate the immune system, and prevent the invasion of harmful pathogens. When the vaginal microbiota is disrupted, it can lead to diseases and infections. The observed disturbance is distinguished by a reduction in the prevalence of Lactobacillus and a concurrent rise in the number of other bacterial species that exhibit a higher tolerance to low oxygen levels. Gynecologic cancers are a group of cancers that affect the female reproductive organs and tissues, such as the ovaries, uterus, cervix, vagina, vulva, and endometrium. These cancers are a major global health problem for women. Understanding the complex interactions between the host and the vaginal microorganisms may provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of gynecologic cancers. This could improve the quality of life and health outcomes for women.

## Microbial genomics: a potential toolkit for forensic investigations.
 15.06.2024, _P Tripathi, R Render, S Nidhi, V Tripathi_


Microbial forensics is a new discipline of science that analyzes evidence related to biological crime through the uniqueness and abundance of microorganisms and their toxins. Microorganisms remain alive longer than any other trace of biological evidence, such as DNA, fingerprints, and fibers, because of the protective cell membrane or capsules. Microbiological research has opened up various possibilities for forensic investigations of microbial flora. Current molecular technologies, including DNA sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, metagenomics, DNA fingerprinting, and molecular phylogeny, provide valid results for forensic investigations. Recent advancements in genome sequencing technologies, genetic data generation, and bioinformatic tools have significantly improved microbial sampling methods and forensic analyses. In this review, we discuss the applications of microbial genomic tools and technologies in forensic investigations, including human identification, geolocation, and causes of death.

An altered gut microbiome characterized by reduced abundance of butyrate producing bacteria and reduced gene richness is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). An important complication of T2D is increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. The biguanide metformin is a commonly prescribed medication for the control of T2D and metformin treatment has been associated with a significant reduction in the risk of dementia and improved cognition, particularly in people with T2D.

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) therapy is common among perinatal populations for the treatment of mood disorders. Medications can affect diversity and composition of the gut microbiome, which plays a key role in modulating health. While previous studies have examined the effects of antidepressant exposure on the maternal gut microbiome, whether SSRI exposure affects the offspring gut microbiome is unknown. We investigated the effects of maternal fluoxetine exposure on the gut microbiome of maternal and offspring mice during pregnancy and lactation (embryonic day 10-lactation day 21; E10-L21). Stool samples collected on E17, L11, L15, and L21 were examined using 16S rRNA sequencing. Our results suggest that maternal fluoxetine exposure may result in decreased alpha diversity of the offspring gut microbiome in early life. Furthermore, we observed several genera-specific differences in the gut microbiome based on treatment, specifically of Turicibacter, Parasutterella, and Romboutsia. These findings support our understanding of gut health, as dysbiotic development of the gut microbiome has been associated with local and systemic health problems including gastrointestinal morbidities and interrupted growth patterns in infants. Future research should pursue study in human populations and those at high risk for gut microbial dysbiosis and intestinal injury.

In the present scenario, growing population demands more food, resulting in the need for sustainable agriculture. Numerous approaches are explored in response to dangers and obstacles to sustainable agriculture. A viable approach is to be exploiting microbial consortium, which generate diverse biostimulants with growth-promoting characteristics for plants. These bioinoculants play an indispensable role in optimizing nutrient uptake efficiency mitigating environmental stress. Plant productivity is mostly determined by the microbial associations that exist at the rhizospheric region of plants. The engineered consortium with multifunctional attributes can be effectively employed to improve crop growth efficacy. A number of approaches have been employed to identify the efficient consortia for plant growth and enhanced crop productivity. Various plant growth-promoting (PGP) microbes with host growth-supporting characteristics were investigated to see if they might work cohesively and provide a cumulative effect for improved growth and crop yield. The effective microbial consortia should be assessed using compatibility tests, pot experimentation techniques, generation time, a novel and quick plant bioassay, and sensitivity to external stimuli (temperature, pH). The mixture of two or more microbial strains found in the root microbiome stimulates plant growth and development. The present review deals with mechanism, formulation, inoculation process, commercialization, and applications of microbial consortia as plant bioinoculants for agricultural sustainability.

## Anthropogenic pollution may enhance natural transformation in water, favouring the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.

Aquatic ecosystems are crucial in the antimicrobial resistance cycle. While intracellular DNA has been extensively studied to understand human activity's impact on antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) dissemination, extracellular DNA is frequently overlooked. This study examines the effect of anthropogenic water pollution on microbial community diversity, the resistome, and ARG dissemination. We analyzed intracellular and extracellular DNA from wastewater treatment plant effluents and lake surface water by shotgun sequencing. We also conducted experiments to evaluate anthropogenic pollution's effect on transforming extracellular DNA (using Gfp-plasmids carrying ARGs) within a natural microbial community. Chemical analysis showed treated wastewater had higher anthropogenic pollution-related parameters than lake water. The richness of microbial community, antimicrobial resistome, and high-risk ARGs was greater in treated wastewaters than in lake waters both for intracellular and extracellular DNA. Except for the high-risk ARGs, richness was significantly higher in intracellular than in extracellular DNA. Several ARGs were associated with mobile genetic elements and located on plasmids. Furthermore, Gfp-plasmid transformation within a natural microbial community was enhanced by anthropogenic pollution levels. Our findings underscore anthropogenic pollution's pivotal role in shaping microbial communities and their antimicrobial resistome. Additionally, it may facilitate ARG dissemination through extracellular DNA plasmid uptake.

## mbtransfer: Microbiome intervention analysis using transfer functions and mirror statistics.
 14.06.2024, _K Sankaran, P Jeganathan_


Time series studies of microbiome interventions provide valuable data about microbial ecosystem structure. Unfortunately, existing models of microbial community dynamics have limited temporal memory and expressivity, relying on Markov or linearity assumptions. To address this, we introduce a new class of models based on transfer functions. These models learn impulse responses, capturing the potentially delayed effects of environmental changes on the microbial community. This allows us to simulate trajectories under hypothetical interventions and select significantly perturbed taxa with False Discovery Rate guarantees. Through simulations, we show that our approach effectively reduces forecasting errors compared to strong baselines and accurately pinpoints taxa of interest. Our case studies highlight the interpretability of the resulting differential response trajectories. An R package, mbtransfer, and notebooks to replicate the simulation and case studies are provided.
