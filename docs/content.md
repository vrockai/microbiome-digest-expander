## Host-Microbe Metagenomics: a Lens To Refocus Our Perspective on Infectious and Inflammatory Diseases.
 17.08.2021, _KL Kalantar, CR Langelier_


A dynamic relationship involving pathogen, host immune response, and microbiome characterizes the biological framework of many infectious and inflammatory diseases. Combined host/microbe metagenomics (mNGS) enables simultaneous assessment of all three features, enabling the study and diagnosis of diverse infectious and inflammatory processes ranging from pneumonia to sepsis to inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Host/microbe mNGS holds promise for new mechanistic insights, diagnostic approaches, and precision medicine interventions.

## The important role of fungi in inflammatory bowel diseases.
 16.08.2021, _S Wang, YR Zhang, YB Yu_


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a life-threatening and chronic inflammatory disease of gastrointestinal tissue, with complex pathogenesis. Current research on IBD has mainly focused on bacteria; however, the role of fungi in IBD is largely unknown due to the incomplete annotation of fungi in current genomic databases. With the development of molecular techniques, the gut mycobiome has been found to have great diversity. In addition, increasing evidence has shown intestinal mycobiome plays an important role in the physiological and pathological processes of IBD. In this review, we will systemically introduce the recent knowledge about multi-dimensional fungal dysbiosis associated with IBD, the interactions between fungus and bacteria, the role of fungi in inflammation in IBD, and highlight recent advances in the potential therapeutic role of fungus in IBD, which may hold the keys to develop new predictive, therapeutic or prognostic approaches in IBD.

## Characterization of the fecal microbiota of sows and their offspring from German commercial pig farms.

Strategies to combat microbiota-associated health problems are of high interest in pig production. Successful intervention strategies with beneficial long-term effects are still missing. Most studies on pig microbiota have been conducted under standardized experimental conditions, but the situation in commercial farms differs dramatically. This study describes the fecal microbiota in German commercial pig farms under practical conditions. The study is part of the larger project "Optibiom" that aims to use bacterial composition and farm metadata to formulate tailor-made solutions for farm-specific health maintenance strategies. Special consideration is given to the sow-piglet relationship. Fecal samples from sows and their piglets were collected at two time points each in 20 different farms (sows ante- and postpartum and piglets before and after weaning). The extracted DNA was sequenced with Illumina 16S rDNA sequencing. For data analysis and visualization, differential abundance analyses, as well as hierarchical clustering and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were performed. A new "family unit" was implemented to compare farms based on the association between the microbiota in sows and their offspring. There are distinct changes in the microbial communities in sows before and after birth as well as in suckling and post-weaning piglets. The suckling pig microbiota is particularly different from all other groups and shows a lower bacterial diversity. While dominant genera in antepartum sows further displace the abundance of non-dominant genera postpartum, the opposite was true for piglets, where non-dominant bacteria in the suckling phase became dominant after weaning. The family unit for sows and their piglets led to separate cluster formation for some farms. The results indicate that the sow-piglet relationship is one driving force for the observed differences of the pig farms. The next step in the analysis will be the combination of metadata (feeding, housing and management practices) to find farm-specific differences that can be exploited to formulate a farm-specific health maintenance strategy.

## Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria HN6 Induced the Change and Reorganization of Fusarium Microflora in the Rhizosphere of Banana Seedlings to Construct a Healthy Banana Microflora.
 07.08.2021, _D Yang, L Wang, T Wang, Y Zhang, S Zhang, Y Luo_


Streptomyces aureoverticillatus HN6 was isolated in our previous study and effectively controlled banana Fusarium wilt. We explored the role of HN6 in constructing a healthy rhizosphere microflora of banana seedlings. The method of antibiotic resistance was used to determine the colonization ability of HN6. The effect of HN6 on the rhizosphere microbial communities was assessed using culture-dependent and high-throughput sequencing. The effect of HN6 on the infection process of the pathogen was evaluated using a pot experiment and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results showed that HN6 could prevent pathogen infection; it increased the nutrient content and diversity of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere, promoted plant growth, and decreased the mycotoxin fusaric acid content and abundance of pathogens in the banana rhizosphere. Thus, HN6 decreased the relative abundance of Fusarium species, increased the diversity of fungi, and increased the relative abundance of bacteria in the rhizosphere. HN6 induced the change and reorganization of the microbial community dominated by Fusarium in the rhizosphere of banana seedlings, and it evolved into a community dominated that was not conducive to the occurrence of diseases, shaping the rhizosphere microflora and promoting the growth of banana.

## Peatland microbial community responses to plant functional group and drought are depth-dependent.

Peatlands store one-third of Earth's soil carbon, the stability of which is uncertain due to climate change-driven shifts in hydrology and vegetation, and consequent impacts on microbial communities that mediate decomposition. Peatland carbon cycling varies over steep physicochemical gradients characterizing vertical peat profiles. However, it is unclear how drought-mediated changes in plant functional groups (PFGs) and water table (WT) levels affect microbial communities at different depths. We combined a multi-year mesocosm experiment with community sequencing across a 70 cm depth gradient, to test the hypotheses that vascular PFGs (Ericaceae vs. sedges) and WT (high vs. low) structure peatland microbial communities in depth-dependent ways. Several key results emerged. 1) Both fungal and prokaryote (bacteria and archaea) community structure shifted with WT and PFG manipulation, but fungi were much more sensitive to PFG whereas prokaryotes were much more sensitive to WT. 2) PFG effects were largely driven by Ericaceae, although sedge effects were evident in specific cases (e.g., methanotrophs). 3) Treatment effects varied with depth: the influence of PFG was strongest in shallow peat (0-10, 10-20 cm), whereas WT effects were strongest at the surface and middle depths (0-10, 30-40 cm), and all treatment effects waned in the deepest peat (60-70 cm). Our results underscore the depth-dependent and taxon-specific ways that plant communities and hydrologic variability shape peatland microbial communities, pointing to the importance of understanding how these factors integrate across soil profiles when examining peatland responses to climate change.
