Introduction: Oral mucositis (OM) is a severe side effect in patients undergoing anticancer therapies, which negatively impacts on their quality of life often leading to either the interruption of the therapy. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is emerging as an effective strategy allowing a faster wound healing.Objectives: This pilot study aims at verifying whether PBM modulates the inflammatory response in patients and its effect on the oral microbiome composition.Materials and methods: Buccal swabs were collected from four patients affected by OM, both on ulcerated and clinically healthy areas, before and on the last day of PBM therapy, as well as on the first day after treatment discontinuation. The concentration of 38 cytokines and the composition of oral microbiome were measured.Results: Most of the pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokines resulted up-regulated by PBM. In addition, PBM influenced the composition of oral microbiome, by decreasing the amount of pathogenic species and promoting the growth of commensal bacteria. These changes were even more evident when separately analysing patients who clinically responded to PBM and the only patient who did not respond.Conclusions: PBM reduces inflammatory burden in patients affected by OM and positively influences the composition of the oral microbiome.

## Changes in Vaginal Microbiome in Pregnant and Nonpregnant Women with Bacterial Vaginosis: Toward Microbiome Diagnostics?
 21.09.2020, _I Mohamed, S Zakeer, M Azab, A Hanora_


Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is highly common, adversely affecting the health of millions of women. New therapeutic targets and diagnostics are urgently needed for BV. Microbiome research offers new prospects in this context. We report here original findings on changes in the vaginal microbiome in pregnant and nonpregnant women with BV. Reproductive age women were recruited for this study after a clinical examination. The total sample (N = 33) included four study groups: (1) healthy nonpregnant women (n = 9), (2) nonpregnant women with symptomatic BV (n = 11), (3) healthy pregnant women without BV (n = 6), and (4) pregnant women with symptomatic BV (N = 7). The vaginal microbiota in healthy women was less diverse, with dominance of a single genus, Lactobacillus. Six major phyla appeared upon taxonomic analysis of the bacterial sequences: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria. For instance, Firmicutes had a significantly higher abundance (98.3%) in the nonpregnant healthy group and 94.3% in pregnant healthy group, compared with nonpregnant (49.7%) and pregnant (67%) women with BV (p = 0.003). Moreover, women with BV had significant increases in representation of Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Bacteroidetes (p = 0.0003, 0.004, and 0.01, respectively). Although the Lactobacillus genus was predominant in healthy women, Gardnerella, Atopobium, Sneathia, and Prevotella significantly increased in nonpregnant women with BV (p = 0.001, 0.014, 0.004, and 0.012, respectively). Dysbiosis of Lactobacillus in pregnant women with BV was accompanied by increased prevalence of the Streptococcus genus. These findings contribute new insights toward microbiome diagnostics and therapeutics innovation in BV.

## Role of Gut Microbiome and Microbial Metabolites in Alleviating Insulin Resistance After Bariatric Surgery.
 25.09.2020, _M Wang, L Li, Y Chen, G Lian, J Wang, J Zhang, K Shan, L Shang, F Tian, C Jing_


Insulin resistance (IR) is the most common pathophysiological change in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several recent studies have suggested that the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites are involved in the pathogenesis of IR. Bariatric surgery, as an effective treatment for T2DM, can markedly alleviate IR through mechanisms that have not been elucidated. In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the changes in the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites (including lipopolysaccharide, short-chain fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, bile acids, methylamines, and indole derivatives) after bariatric surgery. Additionally, we discuss the mechanisms that correlate the changes in microbial metabolites with the postoperative alleviation of IR. Furthermore, we discuss the prospect of bariatric surgery as a treatment for T2DM.
