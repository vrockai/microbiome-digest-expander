## Associations between self-reported psychological symptom severity and gut microbiota: further support for the microgenderome.
 03.05.2022, _M Ganci, E Suleyman, H Butt, M Ball_


Research into the brain-gut-microbiota axis (BGMA) continues to reveal associations between gut microbiota (GM) and psychological symptom expression, inspiring new ways of conceptualising psychological disorders. However, before GM modulation can be touted as a possible auxiliary treatment option, more research is needed as inconsistencies in previous findings regarding these associations are prevalent. Additionally, the concept of the microgenderome, which proposes that GM may interact with sex hormones, has received limited attention in studies using human samples to date. However, such research has demonstrated sex specific associations between GM and psychological symptom expression.

## Impacts of dietary exposure to pesticides on faecal microbiome metabolism in adult twins.

Dietary habits have a profound influence on the metabolic activity of gut microorganisms and their influence on health. Concerns have been raised as to whether the consumption of foodstuffs contaminated with pesticides can contribute to the development of chronic disease by affecting the gut microbiome. We performed the first pesticide biomonitoring survey of the British population, and subsequently used the results to perform the first pesticide association study on gut microbiome composition and function from the TwinsUK registry.

## Diversity and Metabolic Potential of the Gut Microbiome in Adolescents with Functional Bowel Disorder.
 02.05.2022, _ES Klimenko, NL Belkova, AI Romanitsa, AV Pogodina, LV Rychkova_


The article presents the results of a pilot study of the diversity and metabolic potential of the gut microbiome in adolescents with various forms of functional bowel disorder. The participants were the patients of the Clinic of Research Center for Family Health and Human Reproduction Problems. Biological material was studied using metagenomic sequencing of V3-V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We showed that the composition of the minor component of the intestinal microbiome in adolescents with functional bowel disorder differs from that in the healthy subjects (control). Different types of transit disturbances in functional bowel disorder also differ from each other. According to the metabolic potential, adolescents can be divided into two groups irrespective of the pathophysiological manifestations: for one group, a more intensive metabolism in amino acid and lipid biosynthesis pathways was predicted than for the other.

## Diet-microbiome interactions in cancer treatment: Opportunities and challenges for precision nutrition in cancer.
 04.05.2022, _KL Greathouse, M Wyatt, AJ Johnson, EP Toy, JM Khan, K Dunn, DJ Clegg, S Reddy_


Dietary patterns contribute to cancer risk. Separately, microbial factors influence the development of several cancers. However, the interaction of diet and the microbiome and their joint contribution to cancer treatment response needs more research. The microbiome significantly impacts drug metabolism, immune activation, and response to immunotherapy. One of the critical factors affecting the microbiome structure and function is diet. Data demonstrate that the diet and microbiome composition affects the immune response. Moreover, malnutrition is a significant confounder to cancer therapy response. There is little understanding of the interaction of malnutrition with the microbiome in the context of cancer. This review aims to address the current knowledge of dietary intake patterns and malnutrition among cancer patients and the impact on treatment outcomes. Second, this review will provide evidence linking the microbiome to cancer treatment response and provide evidence of the potentially strong effect that diet could have on this interaction. This review will formulate critical questions that will need further research to understand the diet-microbiome relationship in cancer treatment response and directions for future research to guide us to precision nutrition therapy to improve cancer outcomes.
