Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump.

## Legume-supplemented feed for children hospitalised with severe malnutrition: a phase II trial.

Children hospitalised with severe malnutrition have high mortality and readmission rates post-discharge. Current milk-based formulations target restoring ponderal growth but not the modification of gut barrier integrity or microbiome which increases the risk of gram-negative sepsis and poor outcomes. We propose that legume-based feeds rich in fermentable carbohydrates will promote better gut health and improve overall outcomes. We conducted an open-label phase II trial at Mbale and Soroti Regional Referral Hospitals, Uganda, involving 160 children aged 6 months to 5 years with severe malnutrition (mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt; 11·5 cm and/or nutritional oedema). Children were randomised to a lactose-free, chickpea-enriched legume paste feed (LF) (n 80) v. WHO standard F75/F100 feeds (n 80). Co-primary outcomes were change in MUAC and mortality to day 90. Secondary outcomes included weight gain (&gt; 5 g/kg/d), de novo development of diarrhoea, time to diarrhoea and oedema resolution. Day 90 MUAC increase was marginally lower in LF v. WHO arm (1·1 cm (interquartile range (IQR) 1·1) v. 1·4 cm (IQR 1·40), P = 0·09); day 90 mortality was similar (11/80 (13·8 %) v. 12/80 (15 %), respectively, OR 0·91 (95 % CI 0·40, 2·07), P = 0·83). There were no differences in any of the other secondary outcomes. Owing to initial poor palatability of the LF, ten children switched to WHO feeds. Per-protocol analysis indicated a trend to lower day 90 mortality and readmission rates in the LF (6/60 (10 %) and 2/60(3 %)) v. WHO feeds (12/71(17·5 %) and 4/71(6 %)). Further refinement of LF and clinical trials are warranted, given the poor outcomes in children with severe malnutrition.

Species composition of the healthy adult gut microbiota tends to be stable over time. Destabilization of the gut microbiome under the influence of different factors is the main driver of the microbial dysbiosis and subsequent impacts on host physiology. Here, we used metagenomics data from a Swedish longitudinal cohort, to determine the stability of the gut microbiome and uncovered two distinct microbial species groups; persistent colonizing species (PCS) and transient colonizing species (TCS). We validated the continuation of this grouping, generating gut metagenomics data for additional time points from the same Swedish cohort. We evaluated the existence of PCS/TCS across different geographical regions and observed they are globally conserved features. To characterize PCS/TCS phenotypes, we performed bioreactor fermentation with faecal samples and metabolic modeling. Finally, using chronic disease gut metagenome and other multi-omics data, we identified roles of TCS in microbial dysbiosis and link with abnormal changes to host physiology.

## Gut microbiome and schizophrenia: insights from two-sample Mendelian randomization.
 05.09.2024, _K Zhou, A Baranova, H Cao, J Sun, F Zhang_


Growing evidence suggests a potential link between the gut microbiome and schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiome is causally associated with schizophrenia. We performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization to detect bidirectional causal relationships between gut microbiome and schizophrenia. Summary genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of the gut microbiome from the MiBioGen consortium (n = 18,340) and schizophrenia (n = 130,644) were utilized in our study. Then a cohort of sensitive analyses was followed to validate the robustness of MR results. We identified nine taxa that exerted positive causal effects on schizophrenia (OR: 1.08-1.16) and six taxa that conferred negative causal effects on schizophrenia (OR: 0.88-0.94). On the other hand, the reverse MR analysis showed that schizophrenia may increase the abundance of nine taxa (OR: 1.03-1.08) and reduce the abundance of two taxa (OR: 0.94). Our study unveiled mutual causal relationships between gut microbiome and schizophrenia. The findings may provide evidence for the treatment potential of gut microbiomes in schizophrenia.

## Disease-associated microbiome signature species in the gut.
 12.09.2024, _J Li, PW O'Toole_


There is an accumulation of evidence that the human gut microbiota plays a role in maintaining health, and that an altered gut microbiota (sometimes called dysbiosis) associates with risk for many noncommunicable diseases. However, the dynamics of disease-linked bacteria in the gut and other body sites remain unclear. If microbiome alterations prove causative in particular diseases, therapeutic intervention may be possible. Furthermore, microbial signature taxa have been established for the diagnosis of some diseases like colon cancer. We identified 163 disease-enriched and 98 disease-depleted gut microbiome signature taxa at species-level resolution (signature species) from 10 meta-analyses of multiple diseases such as colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatic cancer, and COVID-19 infection. Eight signature species were enriched and nine were depleted across at least half of the diseases studied. Compared with signature species depleted in diseases, a significantly higher proportion of disease-enriched signature species were identified as extra-intestinal (primarily oral) inhabitants, had been reported in bacteremia cases from the literature, and were aerotolerant anaerobes. These findings highlight the potential involvement of oral microbes, bacteremia isolates, and aerotolerant anaerobes in disease-associated gut microbiome alterations, and they have implications for patient care and disease management.

## Synthesis of current pediatric urinary microbiome research.
 04.07.2024, _LM Jeries, TA Sysoeva, L Karstens, MS Kelly_


The human urinary bladder hosts a complex microbial community of low biomass referred to as the urobiome. While the composition of the urobiome has been investigated in adults for over a decade now, only a few studies have considered the presence and composition of the urobiome in children. It is critical to explore how the urobiome develops throughout the life span and how it changes in the presence of various health conditions. Therefore, we set to review the available data on pediatric urobiome composition and its development with age and disease. In addition, we focused on identifying and reporting specific gaps in our knowledge of the pediatric urobiome that we hope will be addressed by future studies in this swiftly developing field with fast-improving methods and consensus.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common entity of Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL) and is characterized by the presence of clonal malignant T cells in the skin. The role of the skin microbiome for MF development and progression are currently poorly understood. Using shotgun metagenomic profiling, real-time qPCR, and T cell receptor sequencing, we compared lesional and nonlesional skin of 20 MF patients with early and advanced MF. Additionally, we isolated Staphylococcus aureus and other bacteria from MF skin for functional profiling and to study the S. aureus virulence factor spa. We identified a subgroup of MF patients with substantial dysbiosis on MF lesions and concomitant outgrowth of S. aureus on plaque-staged lesions, while the other MF patients had a balanced microbiome on lesional skin. Dysbiosis and S. aureus outgrowth were accompanied by ectopic levels of cutaneous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including adaptation of the plaque-derived S. aureus strain. Furthermore, the plaque-derived S. aureus strain showed a reduced susceptibility towards antibiotics and an upregulation of the virulence factor spa, which may activate the NF-κB pathway. Remarkably, patients with dysbiosis on MF lesions had a restricted T cell receptor repertoire and significantly lower event-free survival. Our study highlights the potential for microbiome-modulating treatments targeting S. aureus to prevent MF progression.

## Host diet drives gut microbiome convergence between coral reef fishes and mammals.
 29.08.2024, _S Degregori, NMD Schiettekatte, JM Casey, SJ Brandl, A Mercière, KR Amato, F Mazel, V Parravicini, PH Barber_


Animal gut microbiomes are critical to host physiology and fitness. The gut microbiomes of fishes-the most abundant and diverse vertebrate clade-have received little attention relative to other clades. Coral reef fishes, in particular, make up a wide range of evolutionary histories and feeding ecologies that are likely associated with gut microbiome diversity. The repeated evolution of herbivory in fishes and mammals also allows us to examine microbiome similarity in relationship to diet across the entire vertebrate tree of life. Here, we generate a large coral reef fish gut microbiome dataset (n = 499 samples, 19 species) and combine it with a diverse aggregation of public microbiome data (n = 447) to show that host diet drives significant convergence between coral reef fish and mammalian gut microbiomes. We demonstrate that this similarity is largely driven by carnivory and herbivory and that herbivorous and carnivorous hosts exhibit distinct microbial compositions across fish and mammals. We also show that fish and mammal gut microbiomes share prominent microbial taxa, including Ruminoccocus spp. and Akkermansia spp., and predicted metabolic pathways. Despite the major evolutionary and ecological differences between fishes and mammals, our results reveal that their gut microbiomes undergo similar dietary selective pressures. Thus, diet, in addition to phylosymbiosis must be considered even when comparing the gut microbiomes of distantly related hosts.

## Diet-microbiome interactions promote enteric nervous system resilience following spinal cord injury.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in numerous systemic dysfunctions, including intestinal dysmotility and enteric nervous system (ENS) atrophy. The ENS has capacity to recover following perturbation, yet intestinal pathologies persist. With emerging evidence demonstrating SCI-induced alterations to gut microbiome composition, we hypothesized that microbiome modulation contributes to post-injury enteric recovery. Here, we show that intervention with the dietary fiber, inulin, prevents SCI-induced ENS atrophy and dysmotility in mice. While SCI-associated microbiomes and specific injury-sensitive gut microbes are not sufficient to modulate intestinal dysmotility after injury, intervention with microbially-derived short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites prevents ENS dysfunctions in injured mice. Notably, inulin-mediated resilience is dependent on IL-10 signaling, highlighting a critical diet-microbiome-immune axis that promotes ENS resilience post-injury. Overall, we demonstrate that diet and microbially-derived signals distinctly impact ENS survival after traumatic spinal injury and represent a foundation to uncover etiological mechanisms and future therapeutics for SCI-induced neurogenic bowel.

## Understanding the Barriers to Clinical Trial Referral and Enrollment Among Oncology Providers Within the Veterans Health Administration.
 14.09.2024, _I Monreal, H Chappell, R Kiss, DR Friedman, J Akesson, M Sae-Hau, L Szumita, A Halwani, ES Weiss_


Clinical trials are essential for advancing treatment options in oncology while providing cancer patients with innovative care; however, few cancer patients are referred to clinical trials. System-, provider-, and patient-level barriers to clinical trial participation have been described but have not been studied in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Although the VHA has engaged in several initiatives to improve Veteran's access to clinical trials, including the National Cancer Institute and VA Interagency Group to Accelerate Trials Enrollment program and VHA work on the White House Cancer Moonshot, further research is needed to understand the multifaceted challenges underlying limited enrollment for Veterans who receive care in the VHA system. This research aims to evaluate VHA oncology providers' attitudes toward and experiences with referral and enrollmentof Veterans with cancer into clinical trials, for the purpose of informing actions that could be taken to enhance Veterans' access to clinical trials as well as the VHA's contributions to clinical research.

Trees are associated with a broad range of microorganisms colonising the diverse tissues of their host. However, the early dynamics of the microbiota assembly microbiota from the root to shoot axis and how it is linked to root exudates and metabolite contents of tissues remain unclear. Here, we characterised how fungal and bacterial communities are altering root exudates as well as root and shoot metabolomes in parallel with their establishment in poplar cuttings (Populus tremula x tremuloides clone T89) over 30 days of growth. Sterile poplar cuttings were planted in natural or gamma irradiated soils. Bulk and rhizospheric soils, root and shoot tissues were collected from day 1 to day 30 to track the dynamic changes of fungal and bacterial communities in the different habitats by DNA metabarcoding. Root exudates and root and shoot metabolites were analysed in parallel by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.

## The predicted secreted proteome of activated sludge microorganisms indicates distinct nutrient niches.
 10.09.2024, _K Wasmund, C Singleton, MK Dahl Dueholm, M Wagner, PH Nielsen_


In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), complex microbial communities process diverse chemical compounds from sewage. Secreted proteins are critical because many are the first to interact with or degrade external (macro)molecules. To better understand microbial functions in WWTPs, we predicted secreted proteomes of WWTP microbiota from more than 1,000 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 23 Danish WWTPs with biological nutrient removal. Focus was placed on examining secreted catabolic exoenzymes that target major classes of macromolecules. We demonstrate that Bacteroidota has a high potential to digest complex polysaccharides, but also proteins and nucleic acids. Poorly understood activated sludge members of Acidobacteriota and Gemmatimonadota also have high capacities for extracellular polysaccharide digestion. Secreted nucleases are encoded by 61% of MAGs indicating an importance for extracellular DNA and/or RNA digestion in WWTPs. Secreted lipases were the least common macromolecule-targeting enzymes predicted, encoded mainly by Gammaproteobacteria and Myxococcota. In contrast, diverse taxa encode extracellular peptidases, indicating that proteins are widely used nutrients. Diverse secreted multi-heme cytochromes suggest capabilities for extracellular electron transfer by various taxa, including some Bacteroidota that encode undescribed cytochromes with &gt;100 heme-binding motifs. Myxococcota have exceptionally large secreted protein complements, probably related to predatory lifestyles and/or complex cell cycles. Many Gammaproteobacteria MAGs (mostly former Betaproteobacteria) encode few or no secreted hydrolases, but many periplasmic substrate-binding proteins and ABC- and TRAP-transporters, suggesting they are mostly sustained by small molecules. Together, this study provides a comprehensive overview of how WWTPs microorganisms interact with the environment, providing new insights into their functioning and niche partitioning.IMPORTANCEWastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are critical biotechnological systems that clean wastewater, allowing the water to reenter the environment and limit eutrophication and pollution. They are also increasingly important for the recovery of resources. They function primarily by the activity of microorganisms, which act as a "living sponge," taking up and transforming nutrients, organic material, and pollutants. Despite much research, many microorganisms in WWTPs are uncultivated and poorly characterized, limiting our understanding of their functioning. Here, we analyzed a large collection of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes from WWTPs for encoded secreted enzymes and proteins, with special emphasis on those used to degrade organic material. This analysis showed highly distinct secreted proteome profiles among different major phylogenetic groups of microorganisms, thereby providing new insights into how different groups function and co-exist in activated sludge. This knowledge will contribute to a better understanding of how to efficiently manage and exploit WWTP microbiomes.

## Photodegradation potential of selected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in a middle-order Alpine river downstream of a wastewater treatment plant, during a year of enduring water scarcity.
 13.09.2024, _S Bertolotti, L Carena, S Fenoglio, M Minella, D Vione_


The year 2022 was characterised by significant water shortages and droughts in Italy, with the most pronounced impact observed in the North-Western regions, including Piemonte. In conditions of water scarcity, treated wastewater undergoes little dilution by natural flows and this can deeply affect the chemistry of water-poor rivers and streams. However, increased pollution by wastewater would be partially offset by fast photodegradation of pollutants in shallow water and by the longer time allowed to photochemical reactions if water flows more slowly. We assessed the latter phenomena in the Stura di Lanzo, a middle-order Alpine river tributary of the largest Italian river, the Po, and affected by a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). In 2022, the concentration values of the photochemically significant parameters nitrate, nitrite, and DOC were usually higher downstream of the WWTP outlet, which could slightly favour indirect photodegradation reactions. Direct and indirect photodegradation was assessed for the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs paracetamol, diclofenac, and naproxen, all undergoing rather fast photoreactions. Photochemistry model results show that the three compounds would undergo 10-40 % photodegradation in spring and summer along the stretch separating the wastewater outlet from the confluence of Stura into the Po. Photodegradation would continue in the latter, but other WWTPs might contribute additional pollution in the meanwhile. Albeit significant, photodegradation could only partially promote the elimination of the contaminants.

Groundwater is an essential source of drinking water and agricultural irrigation water, and its protection has become a global goal for public health. However, knowledge about heavy metal(loid) resistance genes (MRGs) in groundwater and the potential co-selection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have seldom been developed. Here, during the wet and dry seasons, we collected 66 groundwater samples (total dissolved solids = 93.9-9530 mg/L) adjacent to Baiyangdian Lake in Northern China, which presented the few metal(loid) and antibiotic contamination. We identified 160 MRGs whose composition exhibited significant seasonal variation, and dissolved metal(loid)s (particularly Ba) played a determinative role in promoting the MRGs proliferation though with relatively low concentrations, suggesting the relatively vulnerable groundwater ecosystems. Moreover, 27.4% of MRG-carrying metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) simultaneously carried ARGs, with the most frequently detected MRG types of Cu, Hg, and As, and ARG types of multidrug and bacitracin. Physicochemical variables, variables related to total dissolved solids, metal(loid)s, and antibiotics synthetically shaped the variation of MRG-ARG hosts in groundwater. We found that the increase of MRG-ARG hosts was critically responsible for the spread of MRGs and ARGs in groundwater. Our findings revealed the widespread co-occurrence of MRGs and ARGs in few-contaminated groundwater and highlighted the crucial roles of salinity in their propagation and transmission.

Background: Tafamidis reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), yet availability and access to therapy vary. Objective: To determine how availability and access to tafamidis impact time-to-diagnosis, time-to-therapy, and cardiovascular outcomes in ATTR-CM. Methods: Ninety-one consecutive ATTR-CM (~97% wt-TTR) patients diagnosed between June 2019 and June 2021 were evaluated for tafamidis. Access to therapy was regulated by compassionate use [n(CU) = 42] prior to, and insurance [n(IA) = 49] after regulatory approval. Results: Tafamidis was started in 37/42 (88.1%), and 39/49 (79.6%) patients, respectively. At diagnosis, ATTR-CM disease stage (≤stage 2: 88.2% vs. 90.9%, p = 0.92) was similar between groups. Timely access (after tafamidis approval) reduced the median time from first presentation to diagnosis from 6.2 (IQR: 1.3-28.9) to 2.4 (0.7-21.7) months, and from first presentation to therapy from 24.4 (10.7-46.8) to 11.8 (6.4-32.4) months. While RV function significantly worsened between diagnosis and therapy initiation in CU patients diagnosed before tafamidis approval (S'-velocity 10.0 ± 2.2 to 9.2 ± 2.2 cm/s; p = 0.018; TAPSE 17.3 ± 4.7 to 15.7 ± 3.9 mm, p = 0.008), it remained unchanged in IA patients (S'-velocity 9.6 ± 2.6 to 9.4 ± 2.3 cm/s; p = 0.83; TAPSE 15.6 ± 4.2 to 16.3 ± 3.1 mm, p = 0.45). After a median follow-up of 42.3 and 24.9 months in CU and IA patients, respectively, timely availability was associated with a reduction in annual heart failure hospitalizations (0.40 vs. 0.16 per patient, p &lt; 0.001) and improved MACE-free survival (HR = 0.51; 95%CI: 0.26-1.00; p = 0.051). Timely diagnosis (&lt;12-months) prolonged MACE-free survival (HR = 0.424; 95%CI: 0.22-0.81; p = 0.004), and reduced HFH (HR = 0.40; 95%CI: 0.19-0.81); p = 0.011) and all-cause mortality (HR = 0.29; 95%CI: 0.11-0.74); p = 0.009). Conclusions: Availability of tafamidis improves diagnostic efficacy in ATTR-CM patients. Timely diagnosis and initiation of therapy reduces adverse cardiovascular events.
