## The impact of maternal and early life malnutrition on health: a diet-microbe perspective.
 12.05.2020, _AJ Forgie, KM Drall, SL Bourque, CJ Field, AL Kozyrskyj, BP Willing_


Early-life malnutrition may have long-lasting effects on microbe-host interactions that affect health and disease susceptibility later in life. Diet quality and quantity in conjunction with toxin and pathogen exposure are key contributors to microbe-host physiology and malnutrition. Consequently, it is important to consider both diet- and microbe-induced pathologies as well as their interactions underlying malnutrition.

## Oral-lung microbiome interactions in lung diseases.
 11.05.2020, _MJ Mammen, FA Scannapieco, S Sethi_


The proximity and continuity of the oral cavity and the lower respiratory tract allows the oropharyngeal microbiome to be a major determinant of the lung microbiome. In addition, host-pathogen interactions related to the oropharyngeal microbiome or its metabolites could propagate systemic inflammation or modulate host defense mechanisms that could affect other organs, including the lung. There is increasing appreciation of the pathophysiologic significance of the lung microbiome, not only in the classical infection-related diseases, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis, but also in chronic noninfectious lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we will explore the relationship of the oral microbiome with lung diseases, such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis.

Little data are available on the subject of gut microbiota composition in endurance athletes as well as connections between diet and specific bacteria abundance. However, most studies suggest that athletes' microbiota undergoes major alterations, which may contribute to increased physical performance. Therefore, we decided to investigate differences in gut microbiota between healthy controls and endurance athletes.

## Colorectal cancer occurrence and treatment based on changes in intestinal flora.
 14.05.2020, _H Si, Q Yang, H Hu, C Ding, H Wang, X Lin_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer in the world, and its incidence has been increasing in recent years. The occurrence of CRC is believed to be related to a variety of factors. Epidemiological data indicate that CRC is mainly affected by environmental factors, eating habits, physical activity and genetic factors. As a newly recognized functional component, the intestinal microbiota plays important roles in preventing CRC formation and maintaining intestinal immunity. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota causes CRC through alterations to immune function, focusing on the mechanisms by which intestinal microbial dysfunction promotes CRC. Furthermore, we describe the changes in the intestinal flora observed in CRC and their potential for CRC treatment with the goal of facilitating future research on the roles of the intestinal flora.

## Multi-omics reveals that the rumen microbiome and its metabolome together with the host metabolome contribute to individualized dairy cow performance.
 13.05.2020, _MY Xue, HZ Sun, XH Wu, JX Liu, LL Guan_


Recently, we reported that some dairy cows could produce high amounts of milk with high amounts of protein (defined as milk protein yield [MPY]) when a population was raised under the same nutritional and management condition, a potential new trait that can be used to increase high-quality milk production. It is unknown to what extent the rumen microbiome and its metabolites, as well as the host metabolism, contribute to MPY. Here, analysis of rumen metagenomics and metabolomics, together with serum metabolomics was performed to identify potential regulatory mechanisms of MPY at both the rumen microbiome and host levels.
