## The Impact of a Mediterranean Diet on the Gut Microbiome in Healthy Human Subjects: A Pilot Study.
 08.11.2021, _JJ Rejeski, FM Wilson, R Nagpal, H Yadav, RB Weinberg_


Despite the reported salutary benefits of a Mediterranean diet (MD) on a wide variety of health conditions, the specific microbial changes associated with an MD within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are not well studied. Specifically, although population and survey-based studies have shown microbial changes, there are no published data on how an MD alters the gut flora in a controlled setting.

## Altered diversity and composition of gut microbiota in patients with allergic rhinitis.
 09.11.2021, _MS Zhou, B Zhang, ZL Gao, RP Zheng, DFHM Marcellin, A Saro, J Pan, L Chu, TS Wang, JF Huang_


Recently, multiple studies have suggested an association between gut dysbiosis and allergic rhinitis (AR) development. However, the role of gut microbiota in AR development remains obscure.

## Faecal microbial biomarkers in early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.
 09.11.2021, _CV Olovo, X Huang, X Zheng, M Xu_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is ranked as the second most common cause of cancer deaths and the third most common cancer globally. It has been described as a 'silent disease' which is often easily treatable if detected early-before progression to carcinoma. Colonoscopy, which is the gold standard for diagnosis is not only expensive but is also an invasive diagnostic procedure, thus, effective and non-invasive diagnostic methods are urgently needed. Unfortunately, the current methods are not sensitive and specific enough in detecting adenomas and early colorectal neoplasia, hampering treatment and consequently, survival rates. Studies have shown that imbalances in such a relationship which renders the gut microbiota in a dysbiotic state are implicated in the development of adenomas ultimately resulting in CRC. The differences found in the makeup and diversity of the gut microbiota of healthy individuals relative to CRC patients have in recent times gained attention as potential biomarkers in early non-invasive diagnosis of CRC, with promising sensitivity, specificity and even cost-effectiveness. This review summarizes recent studies in the application of these microbiota biomarkers in early CRC diagnosis, limitations encountered in the area of the faecal microbiota studies as biomarkers for CRC, and future research exploits that address these limitations.

## Hepatocellular Cancer and Gut Microbiome: Time to Untie Gordian's Knot.
 09.11.2021, _C Aygün, N Tözün_


Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide and the incidence is growing on a global scale. About 90% of cases develop on the cirrhotic liver and the etiology is multifactorial. Increasing number of studies suggest that gut microbiota influences the development and progression of liver diseases, including chronic hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. The key role of gut microbiota in carcinogenesis seems to be associated with genomic instability of host cells and immune dysregulation. Recent clinical studies showed that a stable and healthy microbiota initially could have the ability to resist the emergence of chronic inflammation and, therefore, prevent the induction of carcinogenic cells in various organs such as the esophagus, stomach, colon, and liver. The progression from inflammation to cancer is a stepwise process occurring by the concerted action of several factors such as dysbiosis, increased gut permeability, diet, metabolomic, genetic, and epigenetic changes. In this article, we aimed to review the possible role of gut microbiota in the development, progression, and treatment of HCC.

## Cinnamic acid suppresses bone loss via induction of osteoblast differentiation with alteration of gut microbiota.
 08.11.2021, _S Hong, KH Cha, JH Park, DS Jung, JH Choi, G Yoo, CW Nho_


Osteoporosis, a disease characterized by low bone density that poses a high risk of bone fractures, is associated with aging, diet, and menopause. Despite the various known therapeutic methods for osteoporosis treatment, the development of a new therapeutic agent without side effects in long-term use is required. Cinnamic acid (CA) is a phytochemical found in cinnamon. In this study, we evaluated the effect of CA on osteoporosis and demonstrated its mechanism in MC3T3E1 preosteoblasts and ovariectomized mice. CA treatment induced osteoblast differentiation with elevation of osteogenic markers both in vitro and in vivo. CA treatment ameliorated bone loss resulting in better bone indices, increased gut microbial diversity, and recovered changes in the gut microbial composition induced by ovariectomy. These changes were accompanied by an increase in BMP/TGFβ/Smad signaling. Therefore, CA has the potential to suppress the progress of bone loss via the enhancement of bone density through the regulation of gut microbiota.
