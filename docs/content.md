## Bacteria-related changes in host DNA methylation and the risk for CRC.
 15.09.2020, _I Sobhani, H Rotkopf, K Khazaie_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in men and women combined. Colon-tumor growth is multistage and the result of the accumulation of spontaneous mutations and epigenetic events that silence tumor-suppressor genes and activate oncogenes. Environmental factors are primary contributors to these somatic gene alterations, which account for the increase in incidence of CRC in western countries. In recent decades, gut microbiota and their metabolites have been recognized as essential contributing factors to CRC, and now serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of CRC. In the present review, we highlight holistic approaches to understanding how gut microbiota contributes to CRC. We particularly focus herein on bacteria-related changes in host DNA methylation and the risk for CRC.

## Potential for Novel Biomarkers in Diabetes-Associated Chronic Kidney Disease: Epigenome, Metabolome, and Gut Microbiome.
 15.09.2020, _A Lecamwasam, EI Ekinci, R Saffery, KM Dwyer_


Diabetes-associated chronic kidney disease is a pandemic issue. Despite the global increase in the number of individuals with this chronic condition together with increasing morbidity and mortality, there are currently only limited therapeutic options to slow disease progression. One of the reasons for this is that the current-day "gold standard" biomarkers lack adequate sensitivity and specificity to detect early diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD). This review focuses on the rapidly evolving areas of epigenetics, metabolomics, and the gut microbiome as potential sources of novel biomarkers in diabetes-associated CKD and discusses their relevance to clinical practice. However, it also highlights the problems associated with many studies within these three areas-namely, the lack of adequately powered longitudinal studies, and the lack of reproducibility of results which impede biomarker development and clinical validation in this complex and susceptible population.

## Microbiota-Mitochondria Inter-Talk: A Potential Therapeutic Strategy in Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.
 15.09.2020, _T Vezza, Z Abad-Jiménez, M Marti-Cabrera, M Rocha, VM Víctor_


The rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing concern worldwide. New discoveries in the field of metagenomics and clinical research have revealed that the gut microbiota plays a key role in these metabolic disorders. The mechanisms regulating microbiota composition are multifactorial and include resistance to stress, presence of pathogens, diet, cultural habits and general health conditions. Recent evidence has shed light on the influence of microbiota quality and diversity on mitochondrial functions. Of note, the gut microbiota has been shown to regulate crucial transcription factors, coactivators, as well as enzymes implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism. Moreover, microbiota metabolites seem to interfere with mitochondrial oxidative/nitrosative stress and autophagosome formation, thus regulating the activation of the inflammasome and the production of inflammatory cytokines, key players in chronic metabolic disorders. This review focuses on the association between intestinal microbiota and mitochondrial function and examines the mechanisms that may be the key to their use as potential therapeutic strategies in obesity and T2D management.

The human colon is colonised by a dense microbial community whose species composition and metabolism are linked to health and disease. The main energy sources for colonic bacteria are dietary polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. These play a major role in modulating gut microbial composition and metabolism, which in turn can impact on health outcomes.

## Acute and long-term effects of antibiotics commonly used in laboratory animal medicine on the fecal microbiota.
 15.09.2020, _SW Korte, RA Dorfmeyer, CL Franklin, AC Ericsson_


Biomedical research relies on the use of animal models, and the animals used in those models receive medical care, including antibiotics for brief periods of time to treat conditions such as dermatitis, fight wounds, and suspected bacterial pathogens of unknown etiology. As many mouse model phenotypes are sensitive to changes in the gut microbiota, our goal was to examine the effect of antibiotics commonly administered to mice. Therefore, four treatment groups (subcutaneous enrofloxacin for 7 days, oral enrofloxacin for 14 days, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 14 days, and topical triple antibiotic ointment for 14 days) alongside a fifth control group receiving no treatment (n = 12/group) were included in our study. Fecal samples were collected prior to treatment, immediately after two weeks of exposure, and four weeks after cessation of treatment, and subjected to 16S rRNA library sequencing. The entire experimental design was replicated in mice from two different suppliers. As expected, several treatments including enrofloxacin and triple antibiotic ointment substantially decreased the amount of DNA recovered from fecal material, as well as the microbial richness. Notably, many of these effects were long-lasting with diminished gut microbiota (GM) richness four weeks following exposure, in both substrains of mice. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced minimal to no discernible changes in the taxonomic composition beyond that seen in control mice. Collectively, these data highlight the need to consider the impact on GM of brief and seemingly routine use of antibiotics in the clinical care of research animals.

## The impact of anthelmintic treatment on gut bacterial and fungal communities in diagnosed parasite-free sika deer Cervus nippon.
 15.09.2020, _X Hu, Y Xu, G Liu, D Hu, Y Wang, W Zhang, Y Zheng_


The gut microbiota, including both bacterial and fungal communities, plays vital roles in the gut homeostasis of animals, and antibiotics can lead to disorders of these microbial communities. The use of anthelmintic treatment to control parasitic infection has long been a standard practice, although its impact on the gut microbiota of healthy sika deer is relatively unknown. This study used next-generation sequencing based on 16S/18S/ITS rRNA genes to investigate the shifts in fecal bacterial and fungal communities in parasite-free sika deer after treatment with fenbendazole and ivermectin tablets. The α-diversity of both bacterial and fungal communities was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) after treatment, as were the bacterial genus Bacteroides and fungal genus Candida (P &lt; 0.05). The results of β-diversity, LEfSe analysis, core community's analysis, taxonomic composition, and functional prediction of fungal and bacterial communities confirmed the substantial impacts of anthelmintic treatment on the function and structure of the intestinal microbiota of sika deer. Nevertheless, many lines of evidence, including β-diversity, LEfSe analysis and functional prediction analysis, suggested that the anthelmintics exerted more significant influences on fungal communities than on bacterial communities, suggesting that more attention should be paid to the changes in fungal communities of sika deer under anthelmintic treatment. The present study provides evidence to support the assumption that anthelmintic drugs modify the gut microbiota of deer and serves as the first trial to test the potential effects of anthelmintics on mycobiota in ruminants using high-throughput sequencing techniques. Key Points • Anthelmintic treatment showed significant effects on the gut microbiota of sika deer. • Fungi were more strongly affected by anthelmintic treatment than bacteria. • The profile of mycobiota provides essential data that were previously absent.

## On the way to specificity - Microbiome reflects sponge genetic cluster primarily in highly structured populations.
 15.09.2020, _C Díez-Vives, S Taboada, C Leiva, K Busch, U Hentschel, A Riesgo_


Most animals, including sponges (Porifera), have species-specific microbiomes. Which genetic or environmental factors play major roles structuring the microbial community at the intraspecific level in sponges is, however, largely unknown. In this study, we tested whether geographic location or genetic structure of conspecific sponges influences their microbial assembly. For that, we used three sponge species with different rates of gene flow, and collected samples along their entire distribution range (two from the Mediterranean and one from the Southern Ocean) yielding a total of 393 samples. These three sponge species have been previously analysed by microsatellites or single nucleotide polymorphisms, and here we investigate their microbiomes by amplicon sequencing of the microbial 16S rRNA gene. The sponge Petrosia ficiformis, with highly isolated populations (low gene flow), showed a stronger influence of the host genetic distance on the microbial composition than the spatial distance. Host-specificity was therefore detected at the genotypic level, with individuals belonging to the same host genetic cluster harbouring more similar microbiomes than distant ones. On the contrary, the microbiome of Ircinia fasciculata and Dendrilla antarctica - both with weak population structure (high gene flow) - seemed influenced by location rather than by host genetic distance. Our results suggest that in sponge species with high population structure, the host genetic cluster influence the microbial community more than the geographic location.

## The gut microbiota may be a novel pathogenic mechanism in loosening of orthopedic implants in rats.
 15.09.2020, _MM Moran, BM Wilson, J Li, PA Engen, A Naqib, SJ Green, AS Virdi, A Plaas, CB Forsyth, A Keshavarzian, DR Sumner_


Particles released from implants cause inflammatory bone loss, which is a key factor in aseptic loosening, the most common reason for joint replacement failure. With the anticipated increased incidence of total joint replacement in the next decade, implant failure will continue to burden patients. The gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as an important factor in bone physiology, however, its role in implant loosening is currently unknown. We tested the hypothesis that implant loosening is associated with changes in the gut microbiota in a preclinical model. When the particle challenge caused local joint inflammation, decreased peri-implant bone volume, and decreased implant fixation, the gut microbiota was affected. When the particle challenge did not cause this triad of local effects, the gut microbiota was not affected. Our results suggest that cross-talk between these compartments is a previously unrecognized mechanism of failure following total joint replacement.

## Characterization of Gut Microbiota in Prenatal Cold Stress Offspring Rats by 16S rRNA Sequencing.
 15.09.2020, _J Zheng, T Zhu, L Wang, J Wang, S Lian_


Our previous study showed a reduction of anxiety-like behavior in offspring rats suffered from prenatal cold stress; whether this was related to changes in the offspring gut microbiota is unclear. To obtain the evidence for the role of the gut microbiota in prenatal cold stress offspring, 16S rRNA sequencing technology was used. Male and female offspring rat feces were collected from a room temperature group and a prenatal cold stress group (n ≥ 8) for microbial DNA extraction, followed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The results indicated that prenatal cold stress could change the offspring's gut microbiota composition. Prenatal cold stress significantly upregulates Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus_gasseri, Bacteroides, and Bacteroides-acidifaciens in female offspring, whereas prenatal cold stress significantly reduced Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae in male offspring. These data showed the characterization of gut microbiota in prenatal cold stress offspring rats, and these data suggest that microbiological intervention in the future can potentially prevent the negative effects caused by cold stress to animals.

## Influence of a cholesterol-lowering strain Lactobacillus plantarum LP3 isolated from traditional fermented yak milk on gut bacterial microbiota and metabolome of rats fed with a high-fat diet.
 15.09.2020, _Z Ding, A Hani, W Li, L Gao, W Ke, X Guo_


L. plantarum LP3 isolated from traditinal fermented Tibetan yak milk has been identified as a potential probiotic candidate strain with high cholesterol-lowering activity. In this study, thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups, including normal diet (NC), high-fat diet (HC), and high-fat diet + L. plantarum LP3 (HLp). The effects of L. plantarum LP3 on plasma lipid profile, gut bacterial microbiota, and metabolome induced by high-fat diet in rats were investigated. Results shown that L. plantarum LP3 administration was found to reduce the levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and atherogenic index in the serum of high-fat diet rats. It also controlled the decrease of Bacteroidetes and increase of Firmicutes at the phylum level in gut microbiota induced by high-fat diet in SD rats and increased the diversity and relative abundance of intestinal flora in obese rats. In particular, the LP3 strain controlled the changes induced by the high-fat diet in the abundance of for Lachnospiraceae and Erysipelotrichaceae. We also further observed the beneficial regulatory effects of L. plantarum LP3 on changes in the levels of obesity-related metabolites. The biosynthesis of fatty acids, steroids, and bile acids and metabolism of linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid were the main metabolic pathways adjusted by L. plantarum LP3 in obese rats, and the metabolic rates were similar to those observed in normal diet rats levels. The findings of this study provided useful information on the mechanism underlying the hypocholesterolemic effects of L. plantarum LP3 in the high-fat induced SD rat model with the perspective of modulation of gut microbiota and metabolites.

## The Microbiota-Derived Metabolite of Quercetin, 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid Prevents Malignant Transformation and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Induced by Hemin in Colon Cancer and Normal Colon Epithelia Cell Lines.
 15.09.2020, _M Catalán, J Ferreira, C Carrasco-Pozo_


Meat diet plays a pivotal role in colorectal cancer (CRC). Hemin, a metabolite of myoglobin, produced after meat intake, has been involved in CRC initiation. The compound, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (3,4HPAA) is a scarcely studied microbiota-derived metabolite of the flavonoid quercetin (QUE), which exert antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effect of 3,4HPAA against malignant transformation (increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, DNA oxidative damage and augmented reactive oxidative species (ROS) levels) and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by hemin in normal colon epithelial cells and colon cancer cells. The effect of 3,4HPAA was assessed in comparison to its precursor, QUE and to a known CRC protective agent, sulforaphane (SFN). The results showed that both, tumor and normal cells, exposed to hemin, presented increased cell proliferation, decreased caspase 3 activity and cytochrome c release, as well as augmented production of intracellular and mitochondrial ROS. In addition, hemin decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the activity of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain. These effects of hemin were prevented by the action of 3,4HPAA. The metabolite showed to be more active than QUE and slightly less active than SFN. In conclusion, 3,4HPAA administration could represent a promising strategy for preventing malignant transformation and mitochondrial dysfunction in colon epithelia induced by hemin.

## Constructing bi-plots for random forest: Tutorial.
 15.09.2020, _L Blanchet, R Vitale, R van Vorstenbosch, G Stavropoulos, J Pender, D Jonkers, FV Schooten, A Smolinska_


Current technological developments have allowed for a significant increase and availability of data. Consequently, this has opened enormous opportunities for the machine learning and data science field, translating into the development of new algorithms in a wide range of applications in medical, biomedical, daily-life, and national security areas. Ensemble techniques are among the pillars of the machine learning field, and they can be defined as approaches in which multiple, complex, independent/uncorrelated, predictive models are subsequently combined by either averaging or voting to yield a higher model performance. Random forest (RF), a popular ensemble method, has been successfully applied in various domains due to its ability to build predictive models with high certainty and little necessity of model optimization. RF provides both a predictive model and an estimation of the variable importance. However, the estimation of the variable importance is based on thousands of trees, and therefore, it does not specify which variable is important for which sample group. The present study demonstrates an approach based on the pseudo-sample principle that allows for construction of bi-plots (i.e. spin plots) associated with RF models. The pseudo-sample principle for RF. is explained and demonstrated by using two simulated datasets, and three different types of real data, which include political sciences, food chemistry and the human microbiome data. The pseudo-sample bi-plots, associated with RF and its unsupervised version, allow for a versatile visualization of multivariate models, and the variable importance and the relation among them.

## Cultural isolation of spore-forming bacteria in human feces using bile acids.
 15.09.2020, _M Tanaka, S Onizuka, R Mishima, J Nakayama_


Structurally-diversified bile acids (BAs) are involved in shaping of intestinal microbiota as well as absorption of dietary lipids. Taurocholic acid, a conjugated form of BA, has been reported to be a factor triggering germination of a wide range of spore-forming bacteria in intestine. To test a hypothesis that other BAs also promote germination of intestinal bacteria, we attempted culture of bacteria from ethanol-treated feces by using a series of BAs. It was found that conjugated-BAs, notably three glycine-conjugated BAs, glycodeoxycholic acid and glycochenodeoxycholic acid, significantly increased the number and the species variety of colonies formed on the agar plate. These colonized bacteria mostly belonged to class Clostridia, mainly consisting of families Lachnospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae. There were several types of bacteria associated with different sensitivity to each BA. Eventually, we isolated 72 bacterial species of which 61 are known and 11 novel. These results demonstrate that the culturable range of bacteria in intestine can be widened using the germination-inducing activity of BAs. This approach would advance the research on spore-forming Clostridia that contains important but difficult-to-cultured bacteria associate with host health and diseases.

## Bed bugs shape the indoor microbial community composition of infested homes.
 16.09.2020, _ML Kakumanu, ZC DeVries, AM Barbarin, RG Santangelo, C Schal_


_Aged, Animals, Bedbugs, Hot Temperature, Housing, Humans, Microbiota, Poverty_
Indoor pests, and the allergens they produce, adversely affect human health. Surprisingly, however, their effects on indoor microbial communities have not been assessed. Bed bug (Cimex lectularius) infestations pose severe challenges in elderly and low-income housing. They void large amounts of liquid feces into the home environment, which might alter the indoor microbial community composition. In this study, using bed bug-infested and uninfested homes, we showed a strong impact of bed bug infestations on the indoor microbial diversity. Floor dust samples were collected from uninfested and bed bug-infested homes and their microbiomes were analyzed before and after heat interventions that eliminated bed bugs. The microbial communities of bed bug-infested homes were radically different from those of uninfested homes, and the bed bug endosymbiont Wolbachia was the major driver of this difference. After bed bugs were eliminated, the microbial community gradually shifted toward the community composition of uninfested homes, strongly implicating bed bugs in shaping the dust-associated environmental microbiome. Further studies are needed to understand the viability of these microbial communities and the potential risks that bed bug-associated microbes and their metabolites pose to human health.
