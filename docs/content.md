## The Gut-Lung Axis in Cystic Fibrosis.
 02.08.2021, _CE Price, GA O'Toole_


Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a heritable, multi-organ disease that impacts all tissues that normally express CFTR protein. While importance of the airway microbiota has long been recognized, the intestinal microbiota has only recently been recognized as an important player in both intestinal and lung health outcomes for persons with CF (pwCF). Here, we summarize current literature related to the gut-lung axis in CF, with a particular focus on three key ideas: Mechanisms through which microbes influence the gut-lung axis, drivers of microbiota alterations, and the potential for intestinal microbiota remediation.
