## Response and resilience of anammox consortia to nutrient starvation.
 05.02.2022, _D Wang, Y Wang, L Liu, Y Chen, C Wang, YY Li, T Zhang_


It is of critical importance to understand how anammox consortia respond to disturbance events and fluctuations in the wastewater treatment reactors. Although the responses of anammox consortia to operational parameters (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, nutrient concentrations) have frequently been reported in previous studies, less is known about their responses and resilience when they suffer from nutrient interruption.

## Performance determinants of unsupervised clustering methods for microbiome data.
 09.02.2022, _Y Shi, L Zhang, CB Peterson, KA Do, RR Jenq_


In microbiome data analysis, unsupervised clustering is often used to identify naturally occurring clusters, which can then be assessed for associations with characteristics of interest. In this work, we systematically compared beta diversity and clustering methods commonly used in microbiome analyses. We applied these to four published datasets where highly distinct microbiome profiles could be seen between sample groups, as well a clinical dataset with less clear separation between groups.
