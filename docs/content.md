Fungi have been associated with various diseases of the eye like keratitis, uveitis and endophthalmitis. Despite this fact, fungal microbiome (mycobiome) studies compared to the bacterial microbiome studies have remained neglected. In the present study, using metagenomic sequencing, the mycobiomes of the vitreous of healthy control individuals (VC, n = 15) and individuals with post fever retinitis + non-PFR uveitis (PFR+, n = 9) were analysed and compared. The results indicated that Ascomycota was the most predominant phylum in both VC and PFR+ groups. Further, at the genera level it was observed that the abundance of 17 fungal genera were significantly different in post fever retinitis (PFR, n = 6) group compared to control group. Of these 17 genera, it was observed that 14 genera were relatively more abundant in PFR group and the remaining 3 genera in the VC group. Genus Saccharomyces, a commensal of the gut and skin, was predominantly present in the vitreous of both the cohorts, however it was significantly less abundant in PFR group. Further, significant increase in the genera that have a pathogenic interaction with the host were observed in PFR group. On the whole the mycobiome in both the groups differed significantly and formed two distinct clusters in the heatmap and Principal co-ordinate analysis. These results demonstrate significant changes in the mycobiome from the vitreous of post fever retinitis patients compared to healthy controls thus implying that dysbiotic changes in the fungal vitreous microbiome are associated with PFR.

Otitis externa is a common multifactorial disease in dogs, characterized by broad and complex modifications of the ear microbiota. The goal of our study was to describe the ear cerumen microbiota of healthy dogs, within the same animal and between different animals, and to compare the cerumen microbiota of otitis affected dogs with that of healthy animals. The present study included 26 healthy dogs, 16 animals affected by bilateral otitis externa and 4 animals affected by monolateral otitis externa. For each animal cerumen samples from the right and left ear were separately collected with sterile swabs, and processed for DNA extraction and PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. Amplicon libraries were sequenced using an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM), and taxonomical assignment and clustering were performed using QIIME 2 software. Our results indicate that the bacterial community of the cerumen in healthy dogs was characterized by extensive variability, with the most abundant phyla represented by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. The analysis of both alpha and beta diversity between pairs of left and right ear samples from the same dog within the group of affected animals displayed higher differences than between paired samples across healthy dogs. Moreover we observed reduced bacterial richness in the affected group as compared with controls and increased variability in population structure within otitis affected animals, often associated with the proliferation of a single bacterial taxon over the others. Moreover, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas resulted to be the bacterial genera responsible for most distances between the two groups, in association with differences in the bacterial community structure. The cerumen microbiota in healthy dogs exhibits a complex bacterial population which undergoes significant modifications in otitis affected animals.

## The difference between cellulolytic 'culturomes' and microbiomes inhabiting two contrasting soil types.

High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to compare the microbiomes inhabiting two contrasting soil types-sod-podzolic soil and chernozem-and the corresponding culturome communities of potentially cellulolytic bacteria cultured on standard Hutchinson media. For each soil type, soil-specific microorganisms have been identified: for sod-podzolic soil-Acidothermus, Devosia, Phenylobacterium and Tumebacillus, and for chernozem soil-Sphingomonas, Bacillus and Blastococcus. The dynamics of differences between soil types for bulk soil samples and culturomes varied depending on the taxonomic level of the corresponding phylotypes. At high taxonomic levels, the number of common taxa between soil types increased more slowly for bulk soil than for culturome. Differences between soil-specific phylotypes were detected in bulk soil at a low taxonomic level (genus, species). A total of 13 phylotypes were represented both in soil and in culturome. No relationship was shown between the abundance of these phylotypes in soil and culturome.
