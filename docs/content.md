 29.03.2021, _C Rodriguez, N de Prost, S Fourati, C Lamoureux, G Gricourt, M N'debi, F Canoui-Poitrine, I Désveaux, O Picard, V Demontant, E Trawinski, R Lepeule, L Surgers, W Vindrios, JD Lelièvre, N Mongardon, O Langeron, JL Cohen, A Mekontso-Dessap, PL Woerther, JM Pawlotsky_


COVID-19 is characterized by respiratory symptoms of various severities, ranging from mild upper respiratory signs to acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with a high mortality rate. However, the pathophysiology of the disease is largely unknown. Shotgun metagenomics from nasopharyngeal swabs were used to characterize the genomic, metagenomic and transcriptomic features of patients from the first pandemic wave with various forms of COVID-19, including outpatients, patients hospitalized not requiring intensive care, and patients in the intensive care unit, to identify viral and/or host factors associated with the most severe forms of the disease. Neither the genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, nor the detection of bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites were associated with the severity of pulmonary disease. Severe pneumonia was associated with overexpression of cytokine transcripts activating the CXCR2 pathway, whereas patients with benign disease presented with a T helper "Th1-Th17" profile. The latter profile was associated with female gender and a lower mortality rate. Our findings indicate that the most severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by the presence of overactive immune cells resulting in neutrophil pulmonary infiltration which, in turn, could enhance the inflammatory response and prolong tissue damage. These findings make CXCR2 antagonists, in particular IL-8 antagonists, promising candidates for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.

## A multiomics approach to identify host-microbe alterations associated with infection severity in diabetic foot infections: a pilot study.
 23.03.2021, _M Radzieta, F Sadeghpour-Heravi, TJ Peters, H Hu, K Vickery, T Jeffries, HG Dickson, S Schwarzer, SO Jensen, M Malone_


Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) are a major cause of hospitalization and can lead to lower extremity amputation. In this pilot study, we used a multiomics approach to explore the host-microbe complex within DFIs. We observed minimal differences in the overall microbial composition between PEDIS infection severities, however Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus genera were abundant and highly active in most mild to moderate DFIs. Further, we identified the significant enrichment of several virulence factors associated with infection pathogenicity belonging to both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus. In severe DFIs, patients demonstrated a greater microbial diversity and differential gene expression demonstrated the enrichment of multispecies virulence genes suggestive of a complex polymicrobial infection. The host response in patients with severe DFIs was also significantly different as compared to mild to moderate DFIs. This was attributed to the enrichment of host genes associated with inflammation, acute phase response, cell stress and broad immune-related responses, while those associated with wound healing and myogenesis were significantly depleted.

## Interactions between gut microbiota and metabolites modulate cytokine network imbalances in women with unexplained miscarriage.
 18.03.2021, _Y Liu, H Chen, L Feng, J Zhang_


A dysregulation of cytokine networks has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of unexplained pregnancy loss. Gut microbiota affects host immune response and induces an imbalance in cytokine levels. However, how gut microbial dysbiosis disturbs cellular immune function in miscarriage remains inconclusive. Here we report that IL-2, IL-17A, IL-17F, TNF-α, and IFN-γ are significantly increased in serum of miscarriage patients. Fecal microbiome analyses indicate that microbial diversity and the relative abundances of Prevotella_1, Prevotellaceae_UCG_003 and Selenomonas_1 are significantly reduced in the cases. Correlation analyses indicate that some microbe-associated metabolites are positively associated with changes in levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines in the miscarriage group. Moreover, we identify that imidazolepropionic acid and 1,4-methylimidazoleacetic acid are associated with subsequent recurrent miscarriage. Our study highlights the network among gut microbiota, fecal metabolites and Th1/Th17-mediated immune response in miscarriage patients and explores the potential predictive values of two fecal metabolites for recurrent miscarriages.

The gut is inhabited by a densely populated ecosystem, the gut microbiota, that is established at birth. However, the succession by which different bacteria are incorporated into the gut microbiota is still relatively unknown. Here, we analyze the microbiota from 471 Swedish children followed from birth to 5 years of age, collecting samples after 4 and 12 months and at 3 and 5 years of age as well as from their mothers at birth using 16S rRNA gene profiling. We also compare their microbiota to an adult Swedish population. Genera follow 4 different colonization patterns during establishment where Methanobrevibacter and Christensenellaceae colonize late and do not reached adult levels at 5 years. These late colonizers correlate with increased alpha diversity in both children and adults. By following the children through age-specific community types, we observe that children have individual dynamics in the gut microbiota development trajectory.

## Compositional change of gut microbiome and osteocalcin expressing endothelial progenitor cells in patients with coronary artery disease.
 25.03.2021, _T Toya, I Ozcan, MT Corban, JD Sara, EV Marietta, A Ahmad, IE Horwath, DL Loeffler, JA Murray, LO Lerman, A Lerman_


Osteogenic endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to impaired endothelial repair and promote coronary artery disease (CAD) and vascular calcification. Immature EPCs expressing osteocalcin (OCN) has been linked to unstable CAD; however, phenotypic regulation of OCN-expressing EPCs is not understood. We hypothesized that gut-microbiome derived pro-inflammatory substance, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) might be associated with mobilization of OCN-expressing EPCs. This study aimed to investigate the association between dysbiosis, TMAO, and circulating mature and immature OCN-expressing EPCs levels in patients with and without CAD. We included 202 patients (CAD N = 88; no CAD N = 114) who underwent assessment of EPCs using flow cytometry and gut microbiome composition. Mature and immature EPCs co-staining for OCN were identified using cell surface markers as CD34+/CD133-/kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)+ and CD34-/CD133+/KDR+ cells, respectively. The number of observed operational taxonomy units (OTU), index of microbial richness, was used to identify patients with dysbiosis. The number of immature OCN-expressing EPCs were higher in patients with CAD or dysbiosis than patients without. TMAO levels were not associated with circulating levels of OCN-expressing EPCs. The relative abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus was moderately correlated with circulating levels of immature OCN-expressing EPCs, especially in diabetic patients. Gut dysbiosis was associated with increased levels of TMAO, immature OCN-expressing EPCs, and CAD. The relative abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus was correlated with immature OCN-expressing EPCs, suggesting that the harmful effects of immature OCN-expressing EPCs on CAD and potentially vascular calcification might be mediated by gut microbiome-derived systemic inflammation.

## Stool metabolome-microbiota evaluation among children and adolescents with obesity, overweight, and normal-weight using 1H NMR and 16S rRNA gene profiling.
 25.03.2021, _JD Jaimes, A Slavíčková, J Hurych, O Cinek, B Nichols, L Vodolánová, K Černý, J Havlík_


Characterization of metabolites and microbiota composition from human stool provides powerful insight into the molecular phenotypic difference between subjects with normal weight and those with overweight/obesity. The aim of this study was to identify potential metabolic and bacterial signatures from stool that distinguish the overweight/obesity state in children/adolescents. Using 1H NMR spectral analysis and 16S rRNA gene profiling, the fecal metabolic profile and bacterial composition from 52 children aged 7 to 16 was evaluated. The children were classified into three groups (16 with normal-weight, 17 with overweight, 19 with obesity). The metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) among the study groups based on one-way ANOVA testing: arabinose, butyrate, galactose, and trimethylamine. Significantly different (p &lt; 0.01) genus-level taxa based on edgeR differential abundance tests were genus Escherichia and Tyzzerella subgroup 3. No significant difference in alpha-diversity was detected among the three study groups, and no significant correlations were found between the significant taxa and metabolites. The findings support the hypothesis of increased energy harvest in obesity by human gut bacteria through the growing observation of increased fecal butyrate in children with overweight/obesity, as well as an increase of certain monosaccharides in the stool. Also supported is the increase of trimethylamine as an indicator of an unhealthy state.

## Gut dysbiosis and mortality in hemodialysis patients.
 20.03.2021, _TY Lin, PH Wu, YT Lin, SC Hung_


Little is known about the relationship between gut dysbiosis, inflammation, and adverse outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease. We examined the association of microbial diversity with all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients. The gut microbiota was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. During a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the adjusted risk of death among patients with higher diversity (above median) was 74% lower than that among patients with lower diversity (below median). We then compared the microbial composition between nonsurvivors and survivors in a matched case-control study. We observed significantly lower microbial diversity and higher proinflammatory cytokines among nonsurvivors than survivors. Specifically, the relative abundance of Succinivibrio and Anaerostipes, two short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, was markedly reduced in nonsurvivors. Thus, a unique gut microbial composition is associated with an increased risk of mortality among hemodialysis patients and may be used to identify subjects with a poor prognosis.

## The Interplay between Diet, Gut Microbes, and Host Epigenetics in Health and Disease.
 31.03.2021, _T Shock, L Badang, B Ferguson, K Martinez-Guryn_


The mechanisms linking the function of microbes to host health are becoming better defined but are not yet fully understood. One recently explored mechanism involves microbe-mediated alterations in the host epigenome. Consumption of specific dietary components such as fiber, glucosinolates, polyphenols, and dietary fat has a significant impact on gut microbiota composition and function. Microbial metabolism of these dietary components regulates important epigenetic functions that ultimately influences host health. Diet-mediated alterations in the gut microbiome regulate the substrates available for epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation or histone methylation and/or acetylation. In addition, generation of microbial metabolites such as butyrate inhibits the activity of core epigenetic enzymes like histone deacetylases (HDACs). Reciprocally, the host epigenome also influences gut microbial composition. Thus, complex interactions exist between these three factors. This review comprehensively examines the interplay between diet, gut microbes, and host epigenetics in modulating host health. Specifically, the dietary impact on gut microbiota structure and function that in-turn regulates host epigenetics is evaluated in terms of promoting protection from disease development.

## Circadian rhythms and the gut microbiome synchronize the host's metabolic response to diet.
 31.03.2021, _DE Gutierrez Lopez, LM Lashinger, GM Weinstock, MS Bray_


The molecular circadian clock and symbiotic host-microbe relationships both evolved as mechanisms that enhance metabolic responses to environmental challenges. The gut microbiome benefits the host by breaking down diet-derived nutrients indigestible by the host and generating microbiota-derived metabolites that support host metabolism. Similarly, cellular circadian clocks optimize organismal physiology to the environment by influencing the timing and coordination of metabolic processes. Host-microbe interactions are influenced by dietary quality and timing, as well as daily light/dark cycles that entrain circadian rhythms in the host. Together, the gut microbiome and the molecular circadian clock play a coordinated role in neural processing, metabolism, adipogenesis, inflammation, and disease initiation and progression. This review examines the bidirectional interactions between the circadian clock, gut microbiota, and host metabolic systems and their effects on obesity and energy homeostasis. Directions for future research and the development of therapies that leverage these systems to address metabolic disease are highlighted.

## Meta-analysis identifies the effect of dietary multi-enzyme supplementation on gut health of pigs.
 01.04.2021, _S Ramani, N Recharla, O Hwang, J Jeong, S Park_


Gut health though is not well defined the role of gastrointestinal tract is vital if an animal must perform well. Apart from digestion, secretion, and absorption gut is harbored with consortium of microbiota which plays a key role in one's health. Enzymes, one of the alternatives for antibiotics with beneficial effects on digestion and consistency of food and its effect on gut health. The effect of enzyme supplementation on gut health is not well established and the objective of this meta-analysis is to investigate if the enzyme supplement has influence on gut. This meta-analysis includes 1221 experiments which has single enzyme studies and or studies with multiple enzyme complexes but not challenged. The ratio of Lactobacillus and E. coli is related to ADFI which showed comparatively lower negative correlation coefficient, with - 0.052 and - 0.035, respectively, whose I2 values are below 25%, showing that these studies show a significantly lower level of heterogeneity. Correlation between villus height, crypt depth, their ratio and fatty acid is also assessed, and it showed that when the animal is supplemented with two enzyme complexes resulted in positive gut health rather than the single or more than two enzymes.

## Silicon-containing water intake confers antioxidant effect, gastrointestinal protection, and gut microbiota modulation in the rodents.
 31.03.2021, _WY Wu, PL Chou, JC Yang, CT Chien_


We explored the effects of silicon-containing water (BT) intake on gastrointestinal function and gut microbiota. BT was obtained by pressuring tap water through silicon minerals (mullite, Al6Si2O13) column. BT decreased H2O2 chemiluminescence counts, indicating its antioxidant activity. Four weeks of BT drinking increased H2O2 scavenging activity and glutathione peroxidase activity of plasma. BT drinking did not affect the body weight but significantly reduced the weight of feces and gastrointestinal motility. BT drinking significantly suppressed pylorus ligation enhanced gastric juice secretion, gastric reactive oxygen species amount, erythrocyte extravasation, IL-1β production by infiltrating leukocyte, and lipid peroxidation within gastric mucosa. Data from 16S rRNA sequencing revealed BT drinking significantly increased beneficial flora including Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Prevotellaceae NK3B31, Weissella paramesenteroides, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus murinus and decreased harmful flora including Mucispirillum, Rodentibacter, and Staphylococcus aureus. This study pioneerly provided scientific evidences for the potential effects of water-soluble forms of silicon intake on antioxidant activity, gastrointestinal function, and gut microbiota modulation.

## Metagenomic analysis exploring taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial communities of a Himalayan urban fresh water lake.
 25.03.2021, _T Ahmad, G Gupta, A Sharma, B Kaur, MA El-Sheikh, MN Alyemeni_


Freshwater lakes present an ecological border between humans and a variety of host organisms. The present study was designed to evaluate the microbiota composition and distribution in Dal Lake at Srinagar, India. The non-chimeric sequence reads were classified taxonomically into 49 phyla, 114 classes, 185 orders, 244 families and 384 genera. Proteobacteria was found to be the most abundant bacterial phylum in all the four samples. The highest number of observed species was found to be 3097 in sample taken from least populated area during summer (LPS) whereas the summer sample from highly populated area (HPS) was found most diverse among all as indicated by taxonomic diversity analysis. The QIIME output files were used for PICRUSt analysis to assign functional attributes. The samples exhibited a significant difference in their microbial community composition and structure. Comparative analysis of functional pathways indicated that the anthropogenic activities in populated areas and higher summer temperature, both decrease functional potential of the Lake microbiota. This is probably the first study to demonstrate the comparative taxonomic diversity and functional composition of an urban freshwater lake amid its highly populated and least populated areas during two extreme seasons (winter and summer).

## Geochemical and metagenomics study of a metal-rich, green-turquoise-coloured stream in the southern Swiss Alps.
 01.04.2021, _A Buetti-Dinh, M Ruinelli, D Czerski, C Scapozza, A Martignier, S Roman, A Caminada, M Tonolla_


The Swiss Alpine environments are poorly described from a microbiological perspective. Near the Greina plateau in the Camadra valley in Ticino (southern Swiss Alps), a green-turquoise-coloured water spring streams off the mountain cliffs. Geochemical profiling revealed naturally elevated concentrations of heavy metals such as copper, lithium, zinc and cadmium, which are highly unusual for the geomorphology of the region. Of particular interest, was the presence of a thick biofilm, that was revealed by microscopic analysis to be mainly composed of Cyanobacteria. A metagenome was further assembled to detail the genes found in this environment. A multitude of genes for resistance/tolerance to high heavy metal concentrations were indeed found, such as, various transport systems, and genes involved in the synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). EPS have been evoked as a central component in photosynthetic environments rich in heavy metals, for their ability to drive the sequestration of toxic, positively-charged metal ions under high regimes of cyanobacteria-driven photosynthesis. The results of this study provide a geochemical and microbiological description of this unusual environment in the southern Swiss Alps, the role of cyanobacterial photosynthesis in metal resistance, and the potential role of such microbial community in bioremediation of metal-contaminated environments.

## The human virome: assembly, composition and host interactions.
 31.03.2021, _G Liang, FD Bushman_


The human body hosts vast microbial communities, termed the microbiome. Less well known is the fact that the human body also hosts vast numbers of different viruses, collectively termed the 'virome'. Viruses are believed to be the most abundant and diverse biological entities on our planet, with an estimated 1031 particles on Earth. The human virome is similarly vast and complex, consisting of approximately 1013 particles per human individual, with great heterogeneity. In recent years, studies of the human virome using metagenomic sequencing and other methods have clarified aspects of human virome diversity at different body sites, the relationships to disease states and mechanisms of establishment of the human virome during early life. Despite increasing focus, it remains the case that the majority of sequence data in a typical virome study remain unidentified, highlighting the extent of unexplored viral 'dark matter'. Nevertheless, it is now clear that viral community states can be associated with adverse outcomes for the human host, whereas other states are characteristic of health. In this Review, we provide an overview of research on the human virome and highlight outstanding recent studies that explore the assembly, composition and dynamics of the human virome as well as host-virome interactions in health and disease.

## MCPdb: The bacterial microcompartment database.
 29.03.2021, _JM Ochoa, K Bair, T Holton, TA Bobik, TO Yeates_


Bacterial microcompartments are organelle-like structures composed entirely of proteins. They have evolved to carry out several distinct and specialized metabolic functions in a wide variety of bacteria. Their outer shell is constructed from thousands of tessellating protein subunits, encapsulating enzymes that carry out the internal metabolic reactions. The shell proteins are varied, with single, tandem and permuted versions of the PF00936 protein family domain comprising the primary structural component of their polyhedral architecture, which is reminiscent of a viral capsid. While considerable amounts of structural and biophysical data have been generated in the last 15 years, the existing functionalities of current resources have limited our ability to rapidly understand the functional and structural properties of microcompartments (MCPs) and their diversity. In order to make the remarkable structural features of bacterial microcompartments accessible to a broad community of scientists and non-specialists, we developed MCPdb: The Bacterial Microcompartment Database (https://mcpdb.mbi.ucla.edu/). MCPdb is a comprehensive resource that categorizes and organizes known microcompartment protein structures and their larger assemblies. To emphasize the critical roles symmetric assembly and architecture play in microcompartment function, each structure in the MCPdb is validated and annotated with respect to: (1) its predicted natural assembly state (2) tertiary structure and topology and (3) the metabolic compartment type from which it derives. The current database includes 163 structures and is available to the public with the anticipation that it will serve as a growing resource for scientists interested in understanding protein-based metabolic organelles in bacteria.

## Single strain control of microbial consortia.
 01.04.2021, _AJH Fedorec, BD Karkaria, M Sulu, CP Barnes_


The scope of bioengineering is expanding from the creation of single strains to the design of microbial communities, allowing for division-of-labour, specialised sub-populations and interaction with "wild" microbiomes. However, in the absence of stabilising interactions, competition between microbes inevitably leads to the removal of less fit community members over time. Here, we leverage amensalism and competitive exclusion to stabilise a two-strain community by engineering a strain of Escherichia coli which secretes a toxin in response to competition. We show experimentally and mathematically that such a system can produce stable populations with a composition that is tunable by easily controllable parameters. This system creates a tunable, stable two-strain consortia while only requiring the engineering of a single strain.
