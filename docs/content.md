## Metagenomics analysis of gut microbiota in response to diet intervention and gestational diabetes in overweight and obese women: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Gut microbiota and diet are known to contribute to human metabolism. We investigated whether the metagenomic gut microbiota composition and function changes over pregnancy are related to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and can be modified by dietary supplements, fish oil and/or probiotics.

## A nitrogenase-like enzyme system catalyzes methionine, ethylene, and methane biogenesis.

Bacterial production of gaseous hydrocarbons such as ethylene and methane affects soil environments and atmospheric climate. We demonstrate that biogenic methane and ethylene from terrestrial and freshwater bacteria are directly produced by a previously unknown methionine biosynthesis pathway. This pathway, present in numerous species, uses a nitrogenase-like reductase that is distinct from known nitrogenases and nitrogenase-like reductases and specifically functions in C-S bond breakage to reduce ubiquitous and appreciable volatile organic sulfur compounds such as dimethyl sulfide and (2-methylthio)ethanol. Liberated methanethiol serves as the immediate precursor to methionine, while ethylene or methane is released into the environment. Anaerobic ethylene production by this pathway apparently explains the long-standing observation of ethylene accumulation in oxygen-depleted soils. Methane production reveals an additional bacterial pathway distinct from archaeal methanogenesis.

## Effect of glycerol feed-supplementation on seabass metabolism and gut microbiota.

Dietary glycerol supplementation in aquaculture feed is seen as an alternative and inexpensive way to fuel fish metabolism, attenuate metabolic utilization of dietary proteins and, subsequently, reduce nitrogen excretion. In this study, we evaluated the impact of dietary glycerol supplementation on nitrogen excretion of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and its effects on metabolite profile and bacterial community composition of gut digesta. These effects were evaluated in a 60-day trial with fish fed diets supplemented with 2.5% or 5% (w/w) refined glycerol and without glycerol supplementation. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to characterize the effects of glycerol supplementation on digesta metabolite and bacterial community composition of 6-h postprandial fish. Our results showed that ammonia excretion was not altered by dietary glycerol supplementation, and the highest glycerol dosage was associated with significant increases in amino acids and a decrease of ergogenic creatine in digesta metabolome. Concomitantly, significant decreases in putative amino acid degradation pathways were detected in the predicted metagenome analysis, suggesting a metabolic shift. Taxon-specific analysis revealed significant increases in abundance of some specific genera (e.g., Burkholderia and Vibrio) and bacterial diversity. Overall, our results indicate glycerol supplementation may decrease amino acid catabolism without adversely affecting fish gut bacterial communities.Key points• Glycerol can be an inexpensive and energetic alternative in fish feed formulations.• Glycerol did not affect nitrogen excretion and gut bacteriome composition.• Glycerol reduced uptake of amino acids and increased uptake of ergogenic creatine.• Glycerol reduced putative amino acid degradation pathways in predicted metagenome.

## A heterogeneous microbial consortium producing short-chain fatty acids from lignocellulose.

Microbial consortia are a promising alternative to monocultures of genetically modified microorganisms for complex biotransformations. We developed a versatile consortium-based strategy for the direct conversion of lignocellulose to short-chain fatty acids, which included the funneling of the lignocellulosic carbohydrates to lactate as a central intermediate in engineered food chains. A spatial niche enabled in situ cellulolytic enzyme production by an aerobic fungus next to facultative anaerobic lactic acid bacteria and the product-forming anaerobes. Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Veillonella criceti, or Megasphaera elsdenii were integrated into the lactate platform to produce 196 kilograms of butyric acid per metric ton of beechwood. The lactate platform demonstrates the benefits of mixed cultures, such as their modularity and their ability to convert complex substrates into valuable biochemicals.
