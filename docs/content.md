The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the characteristics of gut microbiome and the effect of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) on glycemic control in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Seventy-four pregnant women newly diagnosed with GDM received MNT for one-week. The effect of glycemic control was evaluated by fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose; and stool samples of pregnant women were collected to detect the gut microbiome before and after MNT. We used a nested case-control study design, with pregnant women with GDM who did not meet glycemic standards after MNT as the ineffective group and those with an age difference of ≤5 years, matched for pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) 1:1, and meeting glycemic control criteria as the effective group. Comparison of the gut microbiome characteristics before MNT showed that the ineffective group was enriched in Desulfovibrio, Aeromonadales, Leuconostocaceae, Weissella, Prevotella, Bacillales_Incertae Sedis XI, Gemella and Bacillales, while the effective group was enriched in Roseburia, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Bifidobacteriales, Bifidobacteriaceae, Holdemania and Proteus. After treatment, the effective group was enriched in Bifidobacterium and Actinomycete, while the ineffective group was enriched in Holdemania, Proteus, Carnobacteriaceae and Granulicatella. In conclusion, the decrease in the abundance of characteristic gut microbiome positively correlated with blood glucose may be a factor influencing the poor hypoglycemic effect of MNT in pregnant women with GDM. Abundance of more characteristic gut microbiome negatively correlated with blood glucose could help control blood glucose in pregnant women with GDM.

Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy and breastfeeding for mothers with HIV has resulted in fewer children acquiring HIV peri- and postnatally, resulting in an increase in the number of children who are exposed to the virus but are not infected (HEU). HEU infants have an increased likelihood of childhood infections and adverse growth outcomes, as well as increased mortality compared to their HIV-unexposed (HUU) peers. We explored potential differences in the gut microbiota in a cohort of 272 Nigerian infants born to HIV-positive and negative mothers in this study during the first 18 months of life.

## The Chronic Wound Phageome: Phage Diversity and Associations with Wounds and Healing Outcomes.
 18.04.2022, _S Verbanic, JM Deacon, IA Chen_


Two leading impediments to chronic wound healing are polymicrobial infection and biofilm formation. Recent studies have characterized the bacterial fraction of these microbiomes and have begun to elucidate compositional correlations to healing outcomes. However, the factors that drive compositional shifts are still being uncovered. The virome may play an important role in shaping bacterial community structure and function. Previous work on the skin virome determined that it was dominated by bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria. To characterize the virome, we enrolled 20 chronic wound patients presenting at an outpatient wound care clinic in a microbiome survey, collecting swab samples from healthy skin and chronic wounds (diabetic, venous, arterial, or pressure) before and after a single, sharp debridement procedure. We investigated the virome using a virus-like particle enrichment procedure, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and a k-mer-based, reference-dependent taxonomic classification method. Taxonomic composition, diversity, and associations with covariates are presented. We find that the wound virome is highly diverse, with many phages targeting known pathogens, and may influence bacterial community composition and functionality in ways that impact healing outcomes. IMPORTANCE Chronic wounds are an increasing medical burden. These wounds are known to be rich in microbial content, including both bacteria and bacterial viruses (phages). The viruses may play an important role in shaping bacterial community structure and function. We analyzed the virome and bacterial composition of 20 patients with chronic wounds. The viruses found in wounds are highly diverse compared to normal skin, unlike the bacterial composition, where diversity is decreased. These data represent an initial look at this relatively understudied component of the chronic wound microbiome and may help inform future phage-based interventions.

## Vaginal microbiota as an unusual cause of spondylodiscitis.
 18.04.2022, _A Kolakowska, F El Alaoui, H Ben Alba, S Challal, E Carbonnelle, F Jaureguy_


The incidence of extra pelvic infections due to vaginal microflora bacteria has increased as growth media and methods of isolation have improved. However, bone infections seem to be still relatively rare, and little is known about their risk factors, clinical presentation, treatment and final outcome. We describe here a spondylodiscitis due to Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Peptostreptococcus indolicus and Prevotella amnii, anaerobic bacteria from vaginal microbiota. Our patient had no obvious predisposing factor and recovered after antibiotic treatment. To our knowledge, this case is the first reported spondylodiscitis caused by polymicrobial vaginal flora in a healthy, immunocompetent woman.

Neutropenic fever (NF) occurs in &gt;70% of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, without a documented etiology in most cases. Antibiotics used to prevent and treat NF disrupt the gut microbiota; these disruptions predict higher post-transplant mortality. We hypothesized that specific features in the gut microbial community may mediate the risk of NF.

## Clinical Observation of the Effects of Oral Opioid on Inflammatory Cytokines and Gut Microbiota in Patients with Moderate to Severe Cancer Pain: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
 18.04.2022, _H Wang, J Luo, X Chen, H Hu, S Li, Y Zhang, C Shi_


Recent studies have revealed that inflammation is a key factor in the causation of opioid analgesic tolerance. Opioids can induce a massive release of inflammatory cytokines and disruption of intestinal barrier function by activating Toll-like receptors 2/4 (TLR2/4), eventually resulting to sustained bacterial transmission and persistent systemic inflammation. However, most of the relevant analyses available were conducted at the level of animal experiments. It is necessary to explore the potential association between opioid tolerance and inflammatory cytokines and gut microbiota in patients with cancer pain.

## The human gut microbiota contributes to type-2 diabetes non-resolution 5-years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

_Animals, Bacteroidetes, Body Weight, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Gastric Bypass, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Mice, Weight Loss_
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is efficient at inducing drastic albeit variable weight loss and type-2 diabetes (T2D) improvements in patients with severe obesity and T2D. We hypothesized a causal implication of the gut microbiota (GM) in these metabolic benefits, as RYGB is known to deeply impact its composition. In a cohort of 100 patients with baseline T2D who underwent RYGB and were followed for 5-years, we used a hierarchical clustering approach to stratify subjects based on the severity of their T2D (Severe vs Mild) throughout the follow-up. We identified via nanopore-based GM sequencing that the more severe cases of unresolved T2D were associated with a major increase of the class Bacteroidia, including 12 species comprising Phocaeicola dorei, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bacteroides caecimuris. A key observation is that patients who underwent major metabolic improvements do not harbor this enrichment in Bacteroidia, as those who presented mild cases of T2D at all times. In a separate group of 36 patients with similar baseline clinical characteristics and preoperative GM sequencing, we showed that this increase in Bacteroidia was already present at baseline in the most severe cases of T2D. To explore the causal relationship linking this enrichment in Bacteroidia and metabolic alterations, we selected 13 patients across T2D severity clusters at 5-years and performed fecal matter transplants in mice. Our results show that 14 weeks after the transplantations, mice colonized with the GM of Severe donors have impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity as compared to Mild-recipients, all in the absence of any difference in body weight and composition. GM sequencing of the recipient animals revealed that the hallmark T2D-severity associated bacterial features were transferred and were associated with the animals' metabolic alterations. Therefore, our results further establish the GM as a key contributor to long-term glucose metabolism improvements (or lack thereof) after RYGB.

## The gut microbial metabolite formate exacerbates colorectal cancer progression.

The gut microbiome is a key player in the immunomodulatory and protumorigenic microenvironment during colorectal cancer (CRC), as different gut-derived bacteria can induce tumour growth. However, the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the host in relation to tumour cell metabolism remains largely unexplored. Here we show that formate, a metabolite produced by the CRC-associated bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum, promotes CRC development. We describe molecular signatures linking CRC phenotypes with Fusobacterium abundance. Cocultures of F. nucleatum with patient-derived CRC cells display protumorigenic effects, along with a metabolic shift towards increased formate secretion and cancer glutamine metabolism. We further show that microbiome-derived formate drives CRC tumour invasion by triggering AhR signalling, while increasing cancer stemness. Finally, F. nucleatum or formate treatment in mice leads to increased tumour incidence or size, and Th17 cell expansion, which can favour proinflammatory profiles. Moving beyond observational studies, we identify formate as a gut-derived oncometabolite that is relevant for CRC progression.

## Drinking water chlorination has minor effects on the intestinal flora and resistomes of Bangladeshi children.

Healthy development of the gut microbiome provides long-term health benefits. Children raised in countries with high infectious disease burdens are frequently exposed to diarrhoeal pathogens and antibiotics, which perturb gut microbiome assembly. A recent cluster-randomized trial leveraging &gt;4,000 child observations in Dhaka, Bangladesh, found that automated water chlorination of shared taps effectively reduced child diarrhoea and antibiotic use. In this substudy, we leveraged stool samples collected from 130 children 1 year after chlorine doser installation to examine differences between treatment and control children's gut microbiota. Water chlorination was associated with increased abundance of several bacterial genera previously linked to improved gut health; however, we observed no effects on the overall richness or diversity of taxa. Several clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes were relatively more abundant in the gut microbiome of treatment children, possibly due to increases in Enterobacteriaceae. While further studies on the long-term health impacts of drinking chlorinated water would be valuable, we conclude that access to chlorinated water did not substantially impact child gut microbiome development in this setting, supporting the use of chlorination to increase global access to safe drinking water.

The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of a gluten-free diet and/or antibiotics on tetanus vaccine induced immunoglobulin G titers and immune cell levels in BALB/c mice. The gluten-free diet was associated with a reduced anti-tetanus IgG response, and it increased the relative abundance of the anti-inflammatory Bifidobacterium significantly in some of the mice. Antibiotics also led to gut microbiota changes and lower initial vaccine titer. After a second vaccination, neither gluten-free diet nor antibiotics reduced the titers. In the spleen, the gluten-free diet significantly increased regulatory T cell (Treg) fractions, CD4+ T cell activation, and tolerogenic dendritic cell fractions and activation, which extend the downregulating effect of the Treg. Therefore, the systemic effect of the gluten-free diet seems mainly tolerogenic. Antibiotics reduced the fractions of CD4+ T and B cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes. These results suggest that vaccine response in mice is under influence of their diet, the gut microbiota and the interplay between them. However, a gluten-free diet seems to work through mechanisms different from those induced by antibiotics. Therefore, diet should be considered when testing vaccines in mice and developing vaccines for humans.

## Hawk tea prevents high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice by activating the AMPK/ACC/SREBP1c signaling pathways and regulating the gut microbiota.
 19.04.2022, _W Tao, W Cao, B Yu, H Chen, R Gong, Q Luorong, J Luo, L Yao, D Zhang_


Scope: Hawk tea, a non-Camellia tea, is an ancient tea drink from southwest China and has been proven to exhibit significant hypoglycaemic and lipid-lowering effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Hawk tea extract (HTE) can improve obesity induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in a mouse model and to determine whether its anti-obesity effects are related to improvements in lipid metabolism and the gut microbiota. Methods and results: We tested the ability of HTE to prevent obesity and regulate gut microbiota in C57BL/6J mice fed with a HFD. We found that HTE significantly reduced body weight, fat deposition, serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and significantly increased serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) induced by HFD. HTE also increased the levels of AMPK and ACC phosphorylation, up-regulated the expression of CPT-1, and downregulated the expression of SREBP1c and FAS. In addition, the administration of HTE significantly altered the composition of the gut microbiota, reduced the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, increased the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides-vulgatus, and Faecalibaculum_rodentium, and decreased the relative abundance of Desulfovibrionaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Conclusions: Collectively, our data demonstrate that HTE can prevent HFD-induced obesity by regulating the AMPK/ACC/SREBP1c signaling pathways and the gut microbiota.

## The gut microbiome influences host diet selection behavior.

SignificanceThe behavior of diet selection or diet choice can have wide-reaching implications, scaling from individual animals to ecological and evolutionary processes. Previous work in this area has largely ignored the potential for intestinal microbiota to modulate host foraging decisions. The notion that the gut microbiome may influence host foraging behavior has been highly speculated for years but has not yet been explicitly tested. Here, we show that germ-free mice colonized by differential microbiomes from wild rodents with varying natural feeding strategies exhibited significant differences in their voluntary dietary selection. Specifically, colonized mice differed in voluntary carbohydrate selection, and divergent feeding preferences were associated with differences in circulating essential amino acids, bacterial tryptophan metabolism, and intestinal morphology. Together, these results demonstrate a role for the microbiome in host nutritional physiology and foraging behavior.

## High-fat diet disrupts REG3γ and gut microbial rhythms promoting metabolic dysfunction.

Gut microbial diurnal oscillations are important diet-dependent drivers of host circadian rhythms and metabolism ensuring optimal energy balance. However, the interplay between diet, microbes, and host factors sustaining intestinal oscillations is complex and poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model, we report the host C-type lectin antimicrobial peptide Reg3γ works with key ileal microbes to orchestrate these interactions in a bidirectional manner and does not correlate with the intestinal core circadian clock. High-fat diet is the primary driver of microbial oscillators that impair host metabolic homeostasis, resulting in arrhythmic host Reg3γ expression that secondarily drives abundance and oscillation of key gut microbes. This illustrates transkingdom coordination of biological rhythms primarily influenced by diet and reciprocal sensor-effector signals between host and microbial components, ultimately driving metabolism. Restoring the gut microbiota's capacity to sense dietary signals mediated by specific host factors such as Reg3γ could be harnessed to improve metabolic dysfunction.

Our understanding of interactions among intestinal helminths, gut microbiota and host is still in its infancy in fish. In this study, the effects of Schyzocotyle acheilognathi infection on the intestinal microbiota, growth and immune reactions of grass carp were explored under laboratory conditions. 16S rDNA amplification sequencing results showed that S. acheilognathi infection altered the composition of intestinal microbiota only at the genus level, with a significant increase in the relative abundance of Turicibacter and Ruminococcus (P &lt; 0.05) and a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Gordonia, Mycobacterium and Pseudocanthomonas (P &lt; 0.05). Schyzocotyle acheilognathi infection had no significant effect (P &gt; 0.05) on the alpha diversity indices (including Chao1, ACE, Shannon, Simpson index) of intestinal microbiota in grass carp, but PERMANOVA analysis showed that microbial structure significantly (P &lt; 0.01) differed between hindgut and foregut. PICRUST prediction showed that some metabolism-related pathways were significantly changed after S. acheilognathi infection. The relative abundance of Turicibacter was positively correlated with the fresh weight of tapeworm (foregut: r = 0.48, P = 0.044; hindgut: r = 0.63, P = 0.005). There was no significant difference in the body condition of grass carp between the S. acheilognathi infected group and the uninfected group (P &gt; 0.05). Intestinal tissue section with HE staining showed that S. acheilognathi infection severely damaged the intestinal villi, causing serious degeneration, necrosis and shedding of intestinal epithelial cells. The real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR results showed that S. acheilognathi infection upregulated the mRNA expression of the immune-related genes: Gal1-L2, TGF-β1 and IgM.

## Gut microbiota promote biotransformation and bioaccumulation of arsenic in tilapia.
 21.04.2022, _D Song, L Chen, S Zhu, L Zhang_


Aquatic organisms such as fish can accumulate high levels of arsenic (As) and transform toxic inorganic As (iAs) to non-toxic arsenobetaine (AsB). Whether the gut microbiota are involved in the process of As accumulation and transformation in fish is unclear. Herein, we subjected tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) to antibiotic treatment for 19 d to remove the gut microbiota, followed by the dietary exposure to arsenate (As(V)) for 16 d. The antibiotic-treated fish accumulated significantly less total As and AsB levels in the intestine and muscle than the fish in the control group. The gut contents (mixture of microbiota, digestive fluid, and diet debris) in the control fish metabolized As(V) to arsenite (As(III)) and organoarsenicals in vitro, while those in the antibiotic-treated fish lost this ability. As(V) exposure significantly changed the fish gut microbiota community. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was found to be the dominant species (&gt;60% of total operational taxonomic unit (OTU) number) in the gut microbiota of As-treated fish. The isolated As-resistant strain S. maltophilia SCSIOOM owned a high capability to metabolize As(V) to As(III) and organoarsenicals. Overall, these results demonstrated that the gut microbiota, at least the As-resistant bacteria, were involved in As biotransformation pathways in fish.

## Linnemannia elongata (Mortierellaceae) stimulates Arabidopsis thaliana aerial growth and responses to auxin, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species.

Harnessing the plant microbiome has the potential to improve agricultural yields and protect plants against pathogens and/or abiotic stresses, while also relieving economic and environmental costs of crop production. While previous studies have gained valuable insights into the underlying genetics facilitating plant-fungal interactions, these have largely been skewed towards certain fungal clades (e.g. arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). Several different phyla of fungi have been shown to positively impact plant growth rates, including Mortierellaceae fungi. However, the extent of the plant growth promotion (PGP) phenotype(s), their underlying mechanism(s), and the impact of bacterial endosymbionts on fungal-plant interactions remain poorly understood for Mortierellaceae. In this study, we focused on the symbiosis between soil fungus Linnemannia elongata (Mortierellaceae) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae), as both organisms have high-quality reference genomes and transcriptomes available, and their lifestyles and growth requirements are conducive to research conditions. Further, L. elongata can host bacterial endosymbionts related to Mollicutes and Burkholderia. The role of these endobacteria on facilitating fungal-plant associations, including potentially further promoting plant growth, remains completely unexplored. We measured Arabidopsis aerial growth at early and late life stages, seed production, and used mRNA sequencing to characterize differentially expressed plant genes in response to fungal inoculation with and without bacterial endosymbionts. We found that L. elongata improved aerial plant growth, seed mass and altered the plant transcriptome, including the upregulation of genes involved in plant hormones and "response to oxidative stress", "defense response to bacterium", and "defense response to fungus". Furthermore, the expression of genes in certain phytohormone biosynthetic pathways were found to be modified in plants treated with L. elongata. Notably, the presence of Mollicutes- or Burkholderia-related endosymbionts in Linnemannia did not impact the expression of genes in Arabidopsis or overall growth rates. Together, these results indicate that beneficial plant growth promotion and seed mass impacts of L. elongata on Arabidopsis are likely driven by plant hormone and defense transcription responses after plant-fungal contact, and that plant phenotypic and transcriptional responses are independent of whether the fungal symbiont is colonized by Mollicutes or Burkholderia-related endohyphal bacteria.

Laboratory mice are widely studied as models of mammalian biology, including the microbiota. However, much of the taxonomic and functional diversity of the mouse gut microbiome is missed in current metagenomic studies, because genome databases have not achieved a balanced representation of the diverse members of this ecosystem. Towards solving this problem, we used flow cytometry and low-coverage sequencing to capture the genomes of 764 single cells from the stool of three laboratory mice. From these, we generated 298 high-coverage microbial genome assemblies, which we annotated for open reading frames and phylogenetic placement. These genomes increase the gene catalog and phylogenetic breadth of the mouse microbiota, adding 135 novel species with the greatest increase in diversity to the Muribaculaceae and Bacteroidaceae families. This new diversity also improves the read mapping rate, taxonomic classifier performance, and gene detection rate of mouse stool metagenomes. The novel microbial functions revealed through our single-cell genomes highlight previously invisible pathways that may be important for life in the murine gastrointestinal tract.

The increase in global population size over the past 100 decades has doubled the requirements for energy resources. To mitigate the limited fossil fuel available, new clean energy sources being environmental sustainable for replacement of traditional energy sources are explored to supplement the current scarcity. Biomass containing lignin and cellulose is the main raw material to replace fossil energy given its abundance and lower emission of greenhouse gases and NOx when transformed into energy. Bacteria, fungi and algae decompose lignocellulose leading to generation of hydrogen, methane, bioethanol and biodiesel being the clean energy used for heating, power generation and the automobile industry. Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) uses microorganisms to decompose biomass in wastewater to generate electricity and remove heavy metals in wastewater. Biomass contains cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and other biomacromolecules which need hydrolyzation for conversion into small molecules by corresponding enzymes in order to be utilized by microorganisms. This paper discusses microbial decomposition of biomass into clean energy and the five major ways of clean energy production, and its economic benefits for future renewable energy security.
