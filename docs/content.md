## Impact of antibiotics on the human microbiome and consequences for host health.
 28.02.2022, _DV Patangia, C Anthony Ryan, E Dempsey, R Paul Ross, C Stanton_


It is well established that the gut microbiota plays an important role in host health and is perturbed by several factors including antibiotics. Antibiotic-induced changes in microbial composition can have a negative impact on host health including reduced microbial diversity, changes in functional attributes of the microbiota, formation, and selection of antibiotic-resistant strains making hosts more susceptible to infection with pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile. Antibiotic resistance is a global crisis and the increased use of antibiotics over time warrants investigation into its effects on microbiota and health. In this review, we discuss the adverse effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota and thus host health, and suggest alternative approaches to antibiotic use.
