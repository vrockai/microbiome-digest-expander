## Ecological roles of nano-picoplankton in stratified waters of an embayment in the southern Benguela.
 07.11.2024, _NR Dames, E Rocke, G Pitcher, E Rybicki, M Pfaff, CL Moloney_


Nano-picoplankton are the dominant primary producers during the post-upwelling period in St Helena Bay, South Africa. Their dynamics on short time scales are not well understood and neither are the community composition, structure, and potential functionality of the surrounding microbiome. Samples were collected over five consecutive days in March 2018 from three depths (1 m, 25 m, 50 m) at a single sampling station in St Helena Bay. There was clear depth-differentiation between the surface and depth in both diversity and function throughout the sampling period for the archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. Daily difference in eukaryote diversity, was more pronounced at 1 m and 25 m with increased abundances of Syndiniales and Bacillariophyta. Surface waters were dominated by photosynthetic and photoheterotrophic microorganisms, while samples at depth were linked to nitrogen cycling processes, with high abundances of nitrifiers and denitrifiers. Strong depth gradients found in the nutrient transporters for ammonia were good indicators of measured uptake rates. This study showed that nano-picoplankton dynamics were driven by light availability, nutrient concentrations, carbon biomass and oxygenation. The nano-picoplankton help sustain ecosystem functioning in St Helena Bay through their ecological roles, which emphasizes the need to monitor this size fraction of the plankton.

## Introduction into natural environments shifts the gut microbiome of captivity-raised filter-feeding bivalves.
 07.11.2024, _SN Vaughn, GW Hopper, IS Gonz√°lez, JR Bucholz, RC Garrick, JD Lozier, PD Johnson, CL Atkinson, CR Jackson_


The gut microbiome is influenced by host species and the environment, but how the environment influences the microbiome of animals introduced into a new ecosystem has rarely been investigated. Freshwater mussels are aquatic fauna, with some threatened or endangered species propagated in hatcheries and introduced into natural systems as part of conservation efforts. The effects of the environment on the freshwater mussel gut microbiome were assessed for two hatchery-propagated species (Lampsilis ovata, Lampsilis ornata) introduced into rivers within their natural range. Mussels were placed in rivers for 8 weeks, after which one subset was collected, another subset remained in that river, and a third subset was reciprocally transplanted to another river in the same river basin for a further 8 weeks. Gut microbiome composition and diversity were characterized for all mussels. After the initial 8 weeks, mussels showed increased gut bacterial species richness and distinct community composition compared to hatchery mussels, but gut microbiome diversity then decreased for mussels that remained in the same river for all 16 weeks. The gut bacterial community of mussels transplanted between rivers shifted to resemble that of mussels placed initially into the recipient river and that remained there for the whole study. All mussels showed high proportions of Firmicutes in their gut microbiome after 8 weeks, suggesting an essential role of this phylum in the gut of Lampsilis species. These findings show that the mussel gut microbiome shifts in response to new environments and provide insights into conservation strategies that involve species reintroductions.

## Real-World HbA1c Changes Among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients Initiating Treatment With a 1.0 Mg Weekly Dose of Semaglutide for Diabetes.
 07.11.2024, _NN Gronroos, C Swift, MS Frazer, A Sargent, M Leszko, E Buysman, S Alvarez, TJ Dunn, J Noone_


Background: Medical management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is complex because of the chronic nature of the disease and its associated comorbidities. Injectable once-weekly semaglutide for diabetes (OW sema T2D) is a type of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist approved for the treatment of patients with T2DM. Objectives: To describe patient characteristics and HbA1c changes for patients prescribed 1.0 mg maintenance dose OW sema T2D. Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients with T2DM with a pre-index glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of at least 7%, initiating treatment with OW sema T2D between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019, and prescribed a 1.0 mg maintenance dose. Patients were identified in the Optum Research Database and were included if they had continuous health plan enrollment for at least 12 months prior to (pre-index) and at least 12 months following (post-index) the date of the first OW sema T2D claim (index). Dose at initiation and prescriber specialty were captured. Change in HbA1c between the latest post-index and pre-index HbA1c measurement was calculated among all patients and among those with at least 90 days of continuous treatment (persistent patients). Results: A total of 2168 patients were included in this study. On average, patients were taking 13.5 different classes of medications. The majority of patients had lipid metabolism disorder (90.8%), hypertension (86.6%), diabetes with complications (86.8%), or other nutritional/endocrine/metabolic disorders (72.5%). The mean HbA1c reduction was 1.2% (P &lt; .001). Patients persistent with OW sema T2D (n =1280) had a mean HbA1c reduction of 1.4% (P &lt; .001). The mean (SD) days covered with a 1.0 mg maintenance dose was 236.1 (94.1) days. Discussion: Despite being medically complex, the patients in this real-world study experienced significant reductions in HbA1c following initiation of OW sema T2D. Conclusions: A 1.0 mg maintenance dose of OW sema T2D is an effective treatment for T2DM in the real world.

## Linking phylogenetic niche conservatism in bacterial communities in sorghum root compartments revealed by the Hongyingzi cultivar.
 07.11.2024, _L Zhao, Z Luo, Z Hu, Y Zhang, T Zhao, Y Zhong, X Wang_


The root system harbours complex bacterial communities, which are critical for plant growth and health. Significant differences exist between bacterial communities in the root compartments; however, limited reports have explored their phylogenetic composition and niche conservatism in the root system of sorghum. We used the sorghum Hongyingzi cultivar as test plant, and applied 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and various statistical approaches. Phylogenetic composition of bacterial communities in root compartments were primarily driven by closely related species with similar environmental adaptations. We also found evidence of phylogenetic niche conservatism in bacterial communities for edaphic factors in the various root compartments, with pH and available N playing essential roles in shaping community composition. Environmental threshold analysis revealed threshold ranges of dominant taxa for pH and available N, indicating wider adaptive thresholds for more abundant taxa. Reconstruction of ancestral states suggested evolutionary changes in adaptability of certain bacterial taxa to edaphic factors, suggesting a shift towards slightly acidic, high N environments and reflecting the prolonged mutual interaction between bacteria and plants in cultivated soils. These findings enhance our understanding of environmental responses and evolutionary dynamics of root-associated microbiota in young sorghum plants and provide novel insights into ecological adaptations, shedding light on their responses to environmental factors. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the ecological dynamics of root-associated microbiota and offers analytical pathways for exploring the nutritional regulation of root microbiota.
