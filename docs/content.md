Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurological disorder classically characterized by impairments in motor system function associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. After almost 200 years since the first description of PD by James Parkinson, unraveling the complexity of PD continues to evolve. It is now recognized that an interplay between genetic and environmental factors influences a diverse range of cellular processes, reflecting on other clinical features including non-motor symptoms. This has consequently highlighted the extensive value of early clinical diagnosis to reduce difficulties of later stage management of PD. Advancement in understanding of PD has made remarkable progress in introducing new tools and strategies such as stem cell therapy and deep brain stimulation. A link between alterations in gut microbiota and PD has also opened a new line. Evidence exists of a bidirectional pathway between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics are being examined that might influence gut-brain axis by altering gut microbiota composition, enteric nervous system, and CNS. This review provides status on use of probiotics for PD. Limitations and future directions will also be addressed to promote further research considering use of probiotics for PD.

Whereas short and problematic sleep are associated with psychological problems in adolescence, causality remains to be elucidated. This study therefore utilized the discordant monozygotic cotwin design and cross-lagged models to investigate how short and problematic sleep affect psychological functioning.

## Human microbiota-transplanted C57BL/6 mice and offspring display reduced establishment of key bacteria and reduced immune stimulation compared to mouse microbiota-transplantation.
 11.05.2020, _R Lundberg, MF Toft, SB Metzdorff, CHF Hansen, TR Licht, MI Bahl, AK Hansen_


Transplantation of germ-free (GF) mice with microbiota from mice or humans stimulates the intestinal immune system in disparate ways. We transplanted a human microbiota into GF C57BL/6 mice and a murine C57BL/6 microbiota into GF C57BL/6 mice and Swiss-Webster (SW) mice. Mice were bred to produce an offspring generation. 56% of the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) present in the human donor microbiota established in the recipient mice, whereas 81% of the C57BL/6 OTUs established in the recipient C57BL/6 and SW mice. Anti-inflammatory bacteria such as Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium from humans were not transferred to mice. Expression of immune-related intestinal genes was lower in human microbiota-mice and not different between parent and offspring generation. Expression of intestinal barrier-related genes was slightly higher in human microbiota-mice. Cytokines and chemokines measured in plasma were differentially present in human and mouse microbiota-mice. Minor differences in microbiota and gene expression were found between transplanted mice of different genetics. It is concluded that important immune-regulating bacteria are lost when transplanting microbiota from humans to C57BL/6 mice, and that the established human microbiota is a weak stimulator of the murine immune system. The results are important for study design considerations in microbiota transplantation studies involving immunological parameters.

## The role of the microbiome in the neurobiology of social behaviour.
 08.05.2020, _A Sarkar, S Harty, KV Johnson, AH Moeller, RN Carmody, SM Lehto, SE Erdman, RIM Dunbar, PWJ Burnet_


Microbes colonise all multicellular life, and the gut microbiome has been shown to influence a range of host physiological and behavioural phenotypes. One of the most intriguing and least understood of these influences lies in the domain of the microbiome's interactions with host social behaviour, with new evidence revealing that the gut microbiome makes important contributions to animal sociality. However, little is known about the biological processes through which the microbiome might influence host social behaviour. Here, we synthesise evidence of the gut microbiome's interactions with various aspects of host sociality, including sociability, social cognition, social stress, and autism. We discuss evidence of microbial associations with the most likely physiological mediators of animal social interaction. These include the structure and function of regions of the 'social' brain (the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex, and the hippocampus) and the regulation of 'social' signalling molecules (glucocorticoids including corticosterone and cortisol, sex hormones including testosterone, oestrogens, and progestogens, neuropeptide hormones such as oxytocin and arginine vasopressin, and monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine). We also discuss microbiome-associated host genetic and epigenetic processes relevant to social behaviour. We then review research on microbial interactions with olfaction in insects and mammals, which contribute to social signalling and communication. Following these discussions, we examine evidence of microbial associations with emotion and social behaviour in humans, focussing on psychobiotic studies, microbe-depression correlations, early human development, autism, and issues of statistical power, replication, and causality. We analyse how the putative physiological mediators of the microbiome-sociality connection may be investigated, and discuss issues relating to the interpretation of results. We also suggest that other candidate molecules should be studied, insofar as they exert effects on social behaviour and are known to interact with the microbiome. Finally, we consider different models of the sequence of microbial effects on host physiological development, and how these may contribute to host social behaviour.

## Enhancement of maximum energy product in Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;/Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposites synthesized by co-precipitation method.
 12.05.2020, _I Hanif, EV R_


The Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe12O19/Y3Fe5O12(BSFO/YIG) nanocomposite ferrite with the hard (BSFO) and soft (YIG) magnetic phase, were prepared by two-step co-precipitation method. The soft magnetic phases are introduced in different ratios (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 1) in the (1-x)Ba0.5Sr0.5Fe12O19/(x)Y3Fe5O12nanocomposite ferrites. The structural, morphological and magnetic properties of nanocomposite ferrites were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) and room temperature vibrational sample magnetometer (VSM). The presence of the hard and soft phase have been confirmed without any secondary phase from XRD analysis, indicating the formation of nanocomposite ferrite. The crystallite size are found to be in the range of 45-55 nm calculated by Scherrer's formula. The HR-TEM revealed hexagonal platelets of BSFO with YIG particles with an average particle size of 90 nm formed at the surface of the (0.9)BSFO/(0.1)YIG nanocomposite. The room temperature magnetic properties of nanocomposite like saturation magnetization (Ms), squareness ratio (Mr/Ms), coercivity (Hc) and nucleation field (Hn) were evaluated by employing VSM. The magnetic measurements have displayed enhancement in coercivity and magnetization for (0.9)BSFO/(0.1)YIG. Compared with pure BSFO, the optimized (0.9)BSFO/(0.1)YIG nanocomposite showed 57% enhancement in energy product (BH)max, indicating that the nanocomposite possessed excellent exchange coupling. To investigate the exchange coupling between the hard and soft phases, dM/dH were plotted using the demagnetization curves and it indicated the effective exchange coupling effect between hard and soft phases.

## Investigating bifidobacteria and human milk oligosaccharide composition of lactating mothers.

Human milk is known to carry its own microbiota, of which the precise origin remains obscure. Breastfeeding allows mother-to-baby transmission of microorganisms as well as the transfer of many other milk components, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which act as metabolizable substrates for particular bacteria, such as bifidobacteria, residing in infant intestinal tract. In the current study, we report the HMO composition of 249 human milk samples, in 163 of which we quantified the abundance of members of the Bifidobacterium genus using a combination of metagenomic and flow cytometric approaches. Metagenomic data allowed us to identify four clusters dominated by Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium crudilactis or Bifidobacterium dentium, as well as a cluster represented by a heterogeneous mix of bifidobacterial species such as Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum. Furthermore, in vitro growth assays on HMOs coupled with in silico glycobiome analyses allowed us to elucidate that members of the Bifidobacterium bifidum and B. breve species exhibit the greatest ability to degrade and grow on HMOs. Altogether, these findings indicate that the bifidobacterial component of the human milk microbiota is not strictly correlated with their ability to metabolize HMOs.

## Bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging reveals translationally active subpopulations of the cystic fibrosis lung microbiota.
 11.05.2020, _TD Valentini, SK Lucas, KA Binder, LC Cameron, JA Motl, JM Dunitz, RC Hunter_


Culture-independent studies of cystic fibrosis lung microbiota have provided few mechanistic insights into the polymicrobial basis of disease. Deciphering the specific contributions of individual taxa to CF pathogenesis requires comprehensive understanding of their ecophysiology at the site of infection. We hypothesize that only a subset of CF microbiota are translationally active and that these activities vary between subjects. Here, we apply bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to visualize and quantify bacterial translational activity in expectorated sputum. We report that the percentage of BONCAT-labeled (i.e. active) bacterial cells varies substantially between subjects (6-56%). We use fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and genomic sequencing to assign taxonomy to BONCAT-labeled cells. While many abundant taxa are indeed active, most bacterial species detected by conventional molecular profiling show a mixed population of both BONCAT-labeled and unlabeled cells, suggesting heterogeneous growth rates in sputum. Differentiating translationally active subpopulations adds to our evolving understanding of CF lung disease and may help guide antibiotic therapies targeting bacteria most likely to be susceptible.

## Longitudinal Analysis of Serum Cytokine Levels and Gut Microbial Abundance Links IL-17/IL-22 with Clostridia and Insulin Sensitivity in Humans.
 05.05.2020, _X Zhou, JS Johnson, D Spakowicz, W Zhou, Y Zhou, E Sodergren, M Snyder, GM Weinstock_


Recent studies using mouse models suggest that interaction between the gut microbiome and IL-17/IL-22 producing cells plays a role in the development of metabolic diseases. We investigated this relationship in humans using data from the prediabetes study of the Integrated Human Microbiome Project (iHMP). Specifically, we addressed the hypothesis that early in the onset of metabolic diseases there is a decline in serum levels of IL-17/IL-22, with concomitant changes in the gut microbiome. Clustering iHMP study participants on the basis of longitudinal IL-17/IL-22 profiles identified discrete groups. Individuals distinguished by low levels of IL-17/IL-22 were linked to established markers of metabolic disease, including insulin sensitivity. These individuals also displayed gut microbiome dysbiosis, characterized by decreased diversity, and IL-17/IL-22-related declines in the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, and order Clostridiales. This ancillary analysis of the iHMP data therefore supports a link between the gut microbiome, IL-17/IL-22 and the onset of metabolic diseases. This raises the possibility for novel, microbiome-related therapeutic targets that may effectively alleviate metabolic diseases in humans as they do in animal models.

## Berberine and its structural analogs have differing effects on functional profiles of individual gut microbiomes.
 07.05.2020, _L Li, L Chang, X Zhang, Z Ning, J Mayne, Y Ye, A Stintzi, J Liu, D Figeys_


The understanding of the effects of compounds on the gut microbiome is limited. In particular, it is unclear whether structurally similar compounds would have similar or distinct effects on the gut microbiome. Here, we selected berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline quaternary alkaloid, and 16 structural analogs and evaluated their effects on seven individual gut microbiomes cultured in vitro. The responses of the individual microbiomes were evaluated by metaproteomic profiles and by assessing butyrate production. We show that both interindividual differences and compound treatments significantly contributed to the variance of metaproteomic profiles. BBR and eight analogs led to changes in proteins involved in microbial defense and stress responses and enrichment of proteins from Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes phyla. It also led to a decrease in proteins from the Firmicutes phylum and its Clostridiales order which correlated to decrease proteins involved in the butyrate production pathway and butyrate concentration. Three of the compounds, sanguinarine, chelerythrine, and ethoxysanguinarine, activated bacterial protective mechanisms, enriched Proteobacteria, increased opacity proteins, and markedly reduced butyrate production. Dihydroberberine had a similar function to BBR in enriching the Akkermansia genus. In addition, it showed less overall adverse impacts on the functionality of the gut microbiome, including a better maintenance of the butyrate level. Our study shows that ex vivo microbiome assay can assess differential regulating effects of compounds with subtle differences and reveals that compound analogs can have distinct effects on the microbiome.

## Developmental Signatures of Microbiota-Derived Metabolites in the Mouse Brain.
 29.04.2020, _JR Swann, SO Spitzer, R Diaz Heijtz_


The gut microbiome is recognized to exert a wide-ranging influence on host health and disease, including brain development and behavior. Commensal bacteria can produce bioactive molecules that enter the circulation and impact host physiology and homeostasis. However, little is known about the potential for these metabolites to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the developing brain under normal physiological conditions. In this study, we used a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic approach to characterize the developmental profiles of microbial-derived metabolites in the forebrains of mice across three key postnatal developmental stages, co-occurring with the maturation of the gut microbiota. We demonstrate that direct metabolites of the gut microbiome (e.g., imidazole propionate) or products of the combinatorial metabolism between the microbiome and host (e.g., 3-indoxyl-sulfate, trimethylamine-N-oxide, and phenylacetylglycine) are present in the forebrains of mice as early as the neonatal period and remain into adulthood. These findings demonstrate that microbial-associated molecules can cross the BBB either in their detected form or as precursor molecules that undergo further processing in the brain. These chemical messengers are able to bind receptors known to be expressed in the brain. Alterations in the gut microbiome may therefore influence neurodevelopmental trajectories via the regulation of these microbial-associated metabolites.

## Bifidobacteria shape host neural circuits during postnatal development by promoting synapse formation and microglial function.
 11.05.2020, _B Luck, MA Engevik, BP Ganesh, EP Lackey, T Lin, M Balderas, A Major, J Runge, RA Luna, RV Sillitoe, J Versalovic_


We hypothesized that early-life gut microbiota support the functional organization of neural circuitry in the brain via regulation of synaptic gene expression and modulation of microglial functionality. Germ-free mice were colonized as neonates with either a simplified human infant microbiota consortium consisting of four Bifidobacterium species, or with a complex, conventional murine microbiota. We examined the cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus of both groups of colonized mice in addition to germ-free control mice. At postnatal day 4 (P4), conventionalized mice and Bifidobacterium-colonized mice exhibited decreased expression of synapse-promoting genes and increased markers indicative of reactive microglia in the cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus relative to germ-free mice. By P20, both conventional and Bifidobacterium-treated mice exhibited normal synaptic density and neuronal activity as measured by density of VGLUT2+ puncta and Purkinje cell firing rate respectively, in contrast to the increased synaptic density and decreased firing rate observed in germ-free mice. The conclusions from this study further reveal how bifidobacteria participate in establishing functional neural circuits. Collectively, these data indicate that neonatal microbial colonization of the gut elicits concomitant effects on the host CNS, which promote the homeostatic developmental balance of neural connections during the postnatal time period.

## Glycerol Monolaurate, an Analogue to a Factor Secreted by Lactobacillus, Is Virucidal against Enveloped Viruses, Including HIV-1.
 09.05.2020, _JL Welch, J Xiang, CM Okeoma, PM Schlievert, JT Stapleton_


The vaginal microbiota influences sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Colonization of the vaginal tract is normally dominated by Lactobacillus species. Both Lactobacillus and Enterococcus faecalis may secrete reutericyclin, which inhibits the growth of a variety of pathogenic bacteria. Increasing evidence suggests a potential therapeutic role for an analogue of reutericyclin, glycerol monolaurate (GML), against microbial pathogens. Previous studies using a macaque vaginal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) transmission model demonstrated that GML reduces transmission and alters immune responses to infection in vitro Previous studies showed that structural analogues of GML negatively impact other enveloped viruses. We sought to expand understanding of how GML inhibits HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses and show that GML restricts HIV-1 entry post-CD4 engagement at the step of coreceptor binding. Further, HIV-1 and yellow fever virus (YFV) particles were more sensitive to GML interference than particles "matured" by proteolytic processing. We show that high-pressure-liquid-chromatography (HPLC)-purified reutericyclin and reutericyclin secreted by Lactobacillus inhibit HIV-1. These data emphasize the importance and protective nature of the normal vaginal flora during viral infections and provide insights into the antiviral mechanism of GML during HIV-1 infection and, more broadly, to other enveloped viruses.IMPORTANCE A total of 340 million sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are acquired each year. Antimicrobial agents that target multiple infectious pathogens are ideal candidates to reduce the number of newly acquired STIs. The antimicrobial and immunoregulatory properties of GML make it an excellent candidate to fit this critical need. Previous studies established the safety profile and antibacterial activity of GML against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. GML protected against high-dose SIV infection and reduced inflammation, which can exacerbate disease, during infection. We found that GML inhibits HIV-1 and other human-pathogenic viruses (yellow fever virus, mumps virus, and Zika virus), broadening its antimicrobial range. Because GML targets diverse infectious pathogens, GML may be an effective agent against the broad range of sexually transmitted pathogens. Further, our data show that reutericyclin, a GML analog expressed by some lactobacillus species, also inhibits HIV-1 replication and thus may contribute to the protective effect of Lactobacillus in HIV-1 transmission.

## Gut microbiome communication with bone marrow regulates susceptibility to amebiasis.

The microbiome provides resistance to infection. However, mechanisms for this are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate in a murine model that colonization with the intestinal bacterium Clostridium scindens provided protection from Entamoeba histolytica colitis via innate immunity. Introduction of C. scindens into the gut microbiota epigenetically altered and expanded bone marrow granulocyte-monocyte-progenitors (GMPs) and resulted in increased intestinal neutrophils with subsequent challenge with E. histolytica. Introduction of C. scindens alone was sufficient to expand GMPs in gnotobiotic mice. Adoptive transfer of bone-marrow from C. scindens colonized-mice into naïve-mice protected against amebic colitis and increased intestinal neutrophils. Children without E. histolytica diarrhea also had a higher abundance of Lachnoclostridia. Because of the known ability of the Lachnoclostridia C. scindens to metabolize the bile salt cholate, we measured deoxycholate and discovered that it was increased in the sera of C. scindens colonized specific pathogen free and gnotobiotic mice, as well as in children protected from amebiasis. Administration of deoxycholate alone (in the absence of C. scindens) increased GMPs and provided protection from amebiasis. We have discovered a mechanism by which C. scindens and the microbially-metabolized bile salt deoxycholic acid alter hematopoietic precursors and provide innate protection from later infection with Entamoeba histolytica.

## The Protective Effects of 2'-Fucosyllactose against E. Coli O157 Infection Are Mediated by the Regulation of Gut Microbiota and the Inhibition of Pathogen Adhesion.
 06.05.2020, _Y Wang, Y Zou, J Wang, H Ma, B Zhang, S Wang_


As the richest component in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) can reduce the colonization of harmful microbiota in vivo, thus lowering the risk of infection; however, the mechanism for this is still unclear. In this study, a model of Escherichia coli O157 infection in healthy adult mice was established to explore the effect of 2'-FL intervention on E. coli O157 colonization and its protective effects on mice. The results showed that 2'-FL intake reduced E. coli O157 colonization in mice intestine by more than 90% (p &lt; 0.001), and it also reduced intestinal inflammation, increased the content of fecal short-chain fatty acids, and enhanced intestinal barrier function. These beneficial effects were attributed to the increased expression of mucins such as MUC2 (increased by more than 20%, p &lt; 0.001), and inhibition of E. coli O157 cell adhesion (about 30% reduction, p &lt; 0.001), and were associated with the modulation of gut microbiota composition. 2'-FL significantly increased the abundance of Akkermansia, a potential probiotic, which may represent the fundamental means by which 2'-FL enhances the expression of mucin and reduces the colonization of harmful bacteria. The current study may support the use of 2'-FL in the prevention of foodborne pathogen infections in human.

## Capsaicin improves glucose homeostasis by enhancing glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion through the regulation of bile acid metabolism via the remodeling of the gut microbiota in male mice.
 02.05.2020, _S Hui, L Huang, X Wang, X Zhu, M Zhou, M Chen, L Yi, M Mi_


Mounting evidence has linked dietary capsaicin (CAP) consumption to the improvement of glucose homeostasis; however, the underlying mechanisms still need to be further elucidated. Male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with CAP administration for 8 weeks, gut microbiota, bile acid (BA) profiles and markers for BA, and glucose metabolism were investigated. CAP improved glucose homeostasis partially by enhancing the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). The gut microbiota was remodeled by CAP and was characterized by the increased abundance of Bacteroides genera, which is related with lithocholic acid (LCA) production. LCA is an endogenous agonist of Takeda G-protein coupled receptor 5 (TGR5); it may enhance GLP-1 secretion in intestinal L cells. Meanwhile, antibiotics experiment abolished the effects of CAP on glucose homeostasis and microbiota transplantation experiments demonstrated that the CAP-induced beneficial effects were transferable, indicating that the effects of CAP on glucose homeostasis were largely dependent on the gut microbiota. Additionally, we further identified that the improvements induced by CAP were attenuated by the antagonist of GLP-1 receptor, indicating that the activation of GLP-1 signaling contributes to the CAP-induced improvement in glucose homeostasis.

## Microbiota-Induced Type I Interferons Instruct a Poised Basal State of Dendritic Cells.

Environmental signals shape host physiology and fitness. Microbiota-derived cues are required to program conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) during the steady state so that they can promptly respond and initiate adaptive immune responses when encountering pathogens. However, the molecular underpinnings of microbiota-guided instructive programs are not well understood. Here, we report that the indigenous microbiota controls constitutive production of type I interferons (IFN-I) by plasmacytoid DCs. Using genome-wide analysis of transcriptional and epigenetic regulomes of cDCs from germ-free and IFN-I receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice, we found that tonic IFNAR signaling instructs a specific epigenomic and metabolic basal state that poises cDCs for future pathogen combat. However, such beneficial biological function comes with a trade-off. Instructed cDCs can prime T cell responses against harmless peripheral antigens when removing roadblocks of peripheral tolerance. Our data provide fresh insights into the evolutionary trade-offs that come with successful adaptation of vertebrates to their microbial environment.

## Intratumoral accumulation of gut microbiota facilitates CD47-based immunotherapy via STING signaling.
 10.05.2020, _Y Shi, W Zheng, K Yang, KG Harris, K Ni, L Xue, W Lin, EB Chang, RR Weichselbaum, YX Fu_


Most studies focus on how intestinal microbiota influence cancer immunotherapy through activating gut immunity. However, immunotherapies related to innate responses such as CD47 blockade rely on the rapid immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Using one defined anaerobic gut microbiota to track whether microbiota interact with host immunity, we observed that Bifidobacterium facilitates local anti-CD47 immunotherapy on tumor tissues through the capacity to accumulate within the tumor microenvironment. Systemic administration of Bifidobacterium leads to its accumulation within the tumor and converts the nonresponder mice into responders to anti-CD47 immunotherapy in a stimulator of interferon genes (STING)- and interferon-dependent fashion. Local delivery of Bifidobacterium potently stimulates STING signaling and increases cross-priming of dendritic cells after anti-CD47 treatment. Our study identifies the mechanism by which gut microbiota preferentially colonize in tumor sites and facilitate immunotherapy via STING signaling.
