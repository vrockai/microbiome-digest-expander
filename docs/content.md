A sedentary lifestyle affects the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota, but previous studies have mainly focused on bacteria instead of fungi. Here, we compared both the fecal bacterial and fungal microbiota compositions and functions in sedentary persons and controls. Subjects from the China Railway Corporation, including 99 inspectors and 88 officials, were enrolled in our study. Fecal microbiota communities were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing for bacteria and ITS sequencing for fungi. We found that the diversity of the gut microbiota of the sedentary group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The sedentary group had a higher abundance of Firmicutes, a lower abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and a higher abundance of Ascomycota, and a lower abundance of Basidiomycota. Furthermore, functional prediction analysis of the fungal microbiota revealed more L-tryptophan degradation to 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde, more phospholipid remodeling (phosphatidylethanolamine, yeast), and more L-tyrosine degradation I, as well as less pentose phosphate pathway (non-oxidative branch), less adenosine nucleotide biosynthesis and less L-valine biosynthesis in the sedentary group (P &lt; 0.05). Thus, a sedentary lifestyle changes the composition and function of the gut microbiota. It may change the pentose phosphate pathway (non-oxidative branch), nucleic acid and amino acid biosynthesis and phospholipid metabolism in fungi.

## Effect of urbanization and parasitism on the gut microbiota of Darwin's finch nestlings.
 14.10.2023, _G Solomon, AC Love, GJ Vaziri, J Harvey, T Verrett, K Chernicky, S Simons, L Albert, JA Chaves, SA Knutie_


Host-associated microbiota can be affected by factors related to environmental change, such as urbanization and invasive species. For example, urban areas often affect food availability for animals, which can change their gut microbiota. Invasive parasites can also influence microbiota through competition or indirectly through a change in the host immune response. These interacting factors can have complex effects on host fitness, but few studies have disentangled the relationship between urbanization and parasitism on an organism's gut microbiota. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the effects of urbanization and parasitism by the invasive avian vampire fly (Philornis downsi) on the gut microbiota of nestling small ground finches (Geospiza fuliginosa) on San Cristóbal Island, Galápagos. We conducted a factorial study in which we experimentally manipulated parasite presence in an urban and nonurban area. Faeces were then collected from nestlings to characterize the gut microbiota (i.e. bacterial diversity and community composition). Although we did not find an interactive effect of urbanization and parasitism on the microbiota, we did find main effects of each variable. We found that urban nestlings had lower bacterial diversity and different relative abundances of taxa compared to nonurban nestlings, which could be mediated by introduction of the microbiota of the food items or changes in host physiology. Additionally, parasitized nestlings had lower bacterial richness than nonparasitized nestlings, which could be mediated by a change in the immune system. Overall, this study advances our understanding of the complex effects of anthropogenic stressors on the gut microbiota of birds.

## Metabarcoding using nanopore long-read sequencing for the unbiased characterization of apicomplexan haemoparasites.
 14.10.2023, _LG Huggins, V Colella, ND Young, RJ Traub_


Apicomplexan haemoparasites generate significant morbidity and mortality in humans and other animals, particularly in many low-to-middle income countries. Malaria caused by Plasmodium remains responsible for some of the highest numbers of annual deaths of any human pathogen, whilst piroplasmids, such as Babesia and Theileria can have immense negative economic effects through livestock loss. Diagnosing haemoparasites via traditional methods like microscopy is challenging due to low-level and transient parasitaemia. PCR-based diagnostics overcome these limitations by being both highly sensitive and specific, but they may be unable to accurately detect coinfections or identify novel species. In contrast, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods can characterize all pathogens from a group of interest concurrently, although, the short-read platforms previously used have been limited in the taxonomic resolution achievable. Here, we used Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) long-read MinION™ sequencer to conduct apicomplexan haemoparasite metabarcoding via sequencing the near full-length 18S ribosomal RNA gene, demonstrating its ability to detect Babesia, Hepatozoon, Neospora, Plasmodium, Theileria and Toxoplasma species. This method was tested on blood-extracted DNA from 100 dogs and the results benchmarked against qPCR and Illumina-based metabarcoding. For two common haemoparasites, nanopore sequencing performed as well as qPCR (kappa agreement statistics &gt; 0.98), whilst also detecting one pathogen, Hepatozoon felis, missed by the other techniques. The long-reads obtained by nanopore sequencing provide an improved species-level taxonomic resolution whilst the method's broad applicability mean it can be used to explore apicomplexan communities from diverse mammalian hosts, on a portable sequencer that easily permits adaptation to field use.

## Bacterial networks in Atlantic salmon with Piscirickettsiosis.

An unbalanced composition of gut microbiota in fish is hypothesized to play a role in promoting bacterial infections, but the synergistic or antagonistic interactions between bacterial groups in relation to fish health are not well understood. We report that pathogenic species in the Piscirickettsia, Aeromonas, Renibacterium and Tenacibaculum genera were all detected in the digesta and gut mucosa of healthy Atlantic salmon without clinical signs of disease. Although Piscirickettsia salmonis (and other pathogens) occurred in greater frequencies of fish with clinical Salmonid Rickettsial Septicemia (SRS), the relative abundance was about the same as that observed in healthy fish. Remarkably, the SRS-positive fish presented with a generalized mid-gut dysbiosis and positive growth associations between Piscirickettsiaceae and members of other taxonomic families containing known pathogens. The reconstruction of metabolic phenotypes based on the bacterial networks detected in the gut and mucosa indicated the synthesis of Gram-negative virulence factors such as colanic acid and O-antigen were over-represented in SRS positive fish. This evidence indicates that cooperative interactions between organisms of different taxonomic families within localized bacterial networks might promote an opportunity for P. salmonis to cause clinical SRS in the farm environment.

## Metagenomic analysis reveals a dynamic microbiome with diversified adaptive functions that respond to ovulation regulation in the mouse endometrium.
 16.10.2023, _S Pu, M Wang, J Wang, Q Zhang, X Ma, R Wang, S Yu, L Wang, Y Pan_


Understanding the microflora inhabiting the reproductive tract is important for a better understanding of female physiology and reproductive health. The endometrial fluid from mice in three reproductive stages (A: Unproductive mice; B: Postovulatory mice; C: Postpartum mice) was extracted for microbial DNA extraction and sequencing. Phenotypic and functional analyses of endometrial microbial enrichment was undertaken using LefSe. The results showed 95 genera and 134 species of microorganisms in the uteri of mice. There were differentially distributed genera, among which Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus were more abundant in the endometrial fluid of mice in the unproductive group. That of mice in the postovulatory group was colonized with Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter and was mainly enriched in metabolic pathways and steroid biosynthesis. The presence of Chlamydia, Enterococcus, Pseudomonadales, Acinetobacter, and Clostridium in the endometrial fluid of postpartum mice, in addition to the enrichment of the endocrine system and the Apelin and FoxO signaling pathways, resulted in a higher number of pathogenic pathways than in the other two groups. The results showed that the microbial diversity characteristics in the endometrium of mice in different reproductive states differed and that they could be involved in the regulation of animal reproduction through metabolic pathways and steroid biosynthesis, suggesting that reproductive diseases induced by microbial diversity alterations in the regulation of animal reproduction cannot be ignored.

## Probiotic-fermented tomato alleviates high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice: Insights from microbiome and metabolomics.
 15.10.2023, _B Wei, Z Peng, W Zheng, S Yang, M Wu, K Liu, M Xiao, T Huang, M Xie, T Xiong_


Probiotic-fermented plant-based foods are associated with weight loss. Here, we hypothesized probiotic-fermented tomato (FT) as a functional food with potential to alleviate obesity, thus the obesity-alleviating effects and mechanisms of FT on high-fat diet-induced obese mice were explored via biochemical, gut microbiome, and serum metabolomics analysis. The results showed that FT performed better than unfermented tomato in reducing body weight gain and fat accumulation, improving dyslipidemia and glucose homeostasis, and relieving inflammation and adipocytokine dysregulation. Particularly, live probiotic-fermented tomato (LFT) was associated with improved diversity, composition, and structure of gut microbiota, suppressed obesity-related genera growth (e.g., Clostridium, Olsenella, and Mucispirillum), and promoted beneficial genera growth (e.g., Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Oscillospira), which were associated negatively with body weight, TC, TG, and TNF-α levels. Additionally, LFT was associated with positive changes in glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, unsaturated fatty acids, and amino acids levels. Collectively, as a functional food, LFT possessed potential for obesity alleviation.

## A critical review of the recent trends in source tracing of microplastics in the environment.
 14.10.2023, _K K M, LV Rajkumar_


Microplastics are found across the globe because of their size and ability to transport across environments. The effects of microplastics on the micro- and macro-organisms have brought out concern over the potential risk to human health and the need to regulate their distribution at the source. Control of microplastic pollution requires region-specific management and mitigation strategies which can be developed with the information on sources and their contributions. This review provides an overview of the sources, fate, and distribution of microplastics along with techniques to source-trace microplastics. Source-tracing approaches provide both qualitative and quantitive information. Since better outcomes have been produced by the integration of techniques like backward trajectory analysis with cluster analysis, the significance of integrated and multi-dimensional approaches has been emphasized. The scope of the plastisphere, heavy metal, and biofilm microbial community in tracing the sources of microplastics are also highlighted. The present review allows the researchers and policymakers to understand the recent trends in the source-tracing of microplastics which will help them to develop techniques and comprehensive action plans to limit the microplastic discharge at sources.

## Keystone taxa of phoD-harboring bacteria mediate alkaline phosphatase activity during biochar remediation of Cd-contaminated soil.
 16.10.2023, _Q Wang, CJ Duan, ZC Geng, CY Xu_


Phosphorus (P)-modified biochar can efficiently remediate cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soil. However, the mechanisms of responses of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and phoD-harboring microorganisms, which are notably sensitive to Cd and P, are not clear during the remediation process. In this study, apple (Malus domestica) tree branches were co-pyrolyzed with tripotassium phosphate (K3PO4) to prepare P-modified biochar, which was used to remediate Cd-soil contaminated soil collected near a mine site. The effect of P-modified biochar on the composition of the phoD-harboring microbial community and its mechanism of interacting with ALP were analyzed. The results showed that the application of P-modified biochar to Cd-contaminated soil promoted the co-precipitation of Cd and phosphate and reduced the content of bioavailable Cd by 69.77 %. P-modified biochar improved the complexity and stability of the soil phoD-harboring microbial community. Furthermore, this study clarified that ALP activity was not completely regulated by the abundance of phoD, but Priestia and Massilia that contain phoD genes dominated the activity of ALP in rhizosphere and bulk soils, respectively. It is notable that bioavailable Cd significantly stimulated Priestia, Massilia, and ALP activity. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the application of P-modified biochar to the remediation of soil contaminated with Cd with respect to P functional microorganisms.

## Maintaining beneficial alga-associated bacterial communities under heat stress: Insights from controlled co-culture experiments using antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.
 13.10.2023, _E Karimi, SM Dittami_


Brown algae, like many eukaryotes, possess diverse microbial communities. Ectocarpus - a model brown alga- relies on these communities for essential processes, such as growth development. Controlled laboratory systems are needed for functional studies of these algal-bacterial interactions. We selected bacterial strains based on their metabolic networks to provide optimal completion of the algal metabolism, rendered them resistant to two antibiotics, and inoculate them to establish controlled co-cultures with Ectocarpus under continuous antibiotic treatment. We then monitored the stability of the resulting associations under control conditions and heat stress using 16S metabarcoding. Antibiotics strongly reduced bacterial diversity both in terms of taxonomy and predicted metabolic functions. In the inoculated sample, 63-69% of reads corresponded to the inoculated strains, and the communities remained stable during temperature stress. They also partially restored the predicted metabolic functions of the natural community. Overall, the development of antibiotic-resistant helper cultures offers a promising route to fully controlled laboratory experiments with algae and microbiota and thus represents an important step towards generating experimental evidence for specific host-microbe interactions in the systems studied. Further work will be required to achieve full control and progressively expand our repertoire of helper strains including those currently "unculturable".

## Deep discovery informs difficult deployment in plant microbiome science.
 13.10.2023, _D Russ, CR Fitzpatrick, PJPL Teixeira, JL Dangl_


Plant-associated microbiota can extend plant immune system function, improve nutrient acquisition and availability, and alleviate abiotic stresses. Thus, naturally beneficial microbial therapeutics are enticing tools to improve plant productivity. The basic definition of plant microbiota across species and ecosystems, combined with the development of reductionist experimental models and the manipulation of plant phenotypes with microbes, has fueled interest in its translation to agriculture. However, the great majority of microbes exhibiting plant-productivity traits in the lab and greenhouse fail in the field. Therapeutic microbes must reach détente, the establishment of uneasy homeostasis, with the plant immune system, invade heterogeneous pre-established plant-associated communities, and persist in a new and potentially remodeled community. Environmental conditions can alter community structure and thus impact the engraftment of therapeutic microbes. We survey recent breakthroughs, challenges, and opportunities in translating beneficial microbes from the lab to the field.

## MGS2AMR: a gene-centric mining of metagenomic sequencing data for pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance profile.
 17.10.2023, _PJ Van Camp, VBS Prasath, DB Haslam, A Porollo_


Identification of pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and evaluating their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are laborious tasks that involve in vitro cultivation, isolation, and susceptibility testing. Recently, a number of methods have been developed that use machine learning algorithms applied to the whole-genome sequencing data of isolates to approach this problem. However, making AMR assessments from more easily available metagenomic sequencing data remains a big challenge.

## Subgroup Identification Using Virtual Twins for Human Microbiome Studies.
 16.10.2023, _H Koh_


Even when the same treatment is employed, some patients are cured, while others are not. The patients that are cured may have beneficial microbes in their body that can boost treatment effects, but it is vice versa for the patients that are not cured. That is, treatment effects can vary depending on the patient's microbiome. If the effects of candidate treatments are well-predicted based on the patient's microbiome, we can select a treatment that is suited to the patient's microbiome or alter the patient's microbiome to improve treatment effects. Here, I introduce a streamlined analytic method, microbiome virtual twins (MiVT), to probe for the interplay between microbiome and treatment. MiVT employs a new prediction method, distance-based machine learning (dML), to improve prediction accuracy in microbiome studies and a new significance test, bootstrap-based test for regression tree (BoRT), to test if each subgroup's treatment effect is the same with the overall treatment effect. MiVT will serve as a useful guideline in microbiome-based personalized medicine to select the therapy that is most suited to the patient's microbiome or to tune the patient's microbiome to be suited to the treatment. MiVT can be implemented using an R package, MiVT, at https://github.com/hk1785/MiVT.
