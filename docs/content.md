## Genetic association between gut microbiome and blood pressure and blood cell count as mediator: A two-step Mendelian randomization analysis.
 18.05.2024, _J Zhang, J He, Y Liao, X Xia, F Yang_


Previous studies have established a genetic link between gut microbiota and hypertension, but whether blood cell count plays a mediating role in this remains unknown. This study aims to explore genetic associations and causal factors involving the gut microbiome, peripheral blood cell count, and blood pressure.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy in childbearing-age females which can cause many complications, such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. The metabolic disorders in patients with PCOS were linked to gut microbial dysbiosis. However, the correlation between the gut microbial community and dyslipidemia in PCOS remains unillustrated. Our study elucidated the different gut microbiota in patients with PCOS and dyslipidemia (PCOS.D) compared to those with only PCOS and healthy women.

## Giant viral signatures on the Greenland ice sheet.

Dark pigmented snow and glacier ice algae on glaciers and ice sheets contribute to accelerating melt. The biological controls on these algae, particularly the role of viruses, remain poorly understood. Giant viruses, classified under the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) supergroup (phylum Nucleocytoviricota), are diverse and globally distributed. NCLDVs are known to infect eukaryotic cells in marine and freshwater environments, providing a biological control on the algal population in these ecosystems. However, there is very limited information on the diversity and ecosystem function of NCLDVs in terrestrial icy habitats.

## Ibuprofen degradation by mixed bacterial consortia: Metabolic pathway and microbial community analysis.
 22.05.2024, _A Rastogi, S Chaudhary, MK Tiwari, MM Ghangrekar_


Degradation of ibuprofen, one of the most consumed drugs globally, by a mixed bacterial consortium was investigated. A contaminated hospital soil was used to enrich a bacterial consortium possessing the ability to degrade 4 mg/L ibuprofen in 6 days, fed on 6 mM acetate as a supplementary carbon source. Maximum ibuprofen degradation achieved was 99.51%, and for optimum ibuprofen degradation modelled statistically, the initial ibuprofen concentration, and temperature were determined to be 0.515 mg/L and 35 °C, respectively. The bacterial community analyses demonstrated an enrichment of Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Bacillus, and Enterococcus in the presence of ibuprofen, suggesting their probable association with the biodegradation process. The biodegradation pathway developed using open-source metabolite predictors, GLORYx and BioTransformer suggested multiple degradation routes. Hydroxylation and oxidation were found to be the major mechanisms in ibuprofen degradation. Mono-hydroxylated metabolites were identified as well as predicted by the bioinformatics-based packages. Oxidation, dehydrogenation, super-hydroxylation, and hydrolysis were some other identified mechanisms.

## Examining the impacts of salt specificity on freshwater microbial community and functional potential following salinization.

The degradation of freshwater systems by salt pollution is a threat to global freshwater resources. Salinization is commonly identified by increased specific conductance (conductivity), a proxy for salt concentrations. However, conductivity fails to account for the diversity of salts entering freshwaters and the potential implications this has on microbial communities and functions. We tested 4 types of salt pollution-MgCl2, MgSO4, NaCl, and Na2SO4-on bacterial taxonomic and functional α-, β-diversity of communities originating from streams in two distinct localities (Nebraska [NE] and Ohio [OH], USA). Community responses depended on the site of origin, with NE and OH exhibiting more pronounced decreases in community diversity in response to Na2SO4 and MgCl2 than other salt amendments. A closer examination of taxonomic and functional diversity metrics suggests that core features of communities are more resistant to induced salt stress and that marginal features at both a population and functional level are more likely to exhibit significant structural shifts based on salt specificity. The lack of uniformity in community response highlights the need to consider the compositional complexities of salinization to accurately identify the ecological consequences of instances of salt pollution.

## Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus Alleviates Acute Injury in Hypoxic Mice.

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a common ailment in high-altitude areas caused by the body's inadequate adaptation to low-pressure, low-oxygen environments, leading to organ edema, oxidative stress, and impaired intestinal barrier function. The gastrointestinal tract, being the first to be affected by ischemia and hypoxia, is highly susceptible to injury. This study investigates the role of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in alleviating acute hypoxic-induced intestinal and tissue damage from the perspective of daily consumed lactic acid bacteria. An acute hypoxia mouse model was established to evaluate tissue injury, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and intestinal barrier function in various groups of mice. The results indicate that strain 4L3 significantly mitigated brain and lung edema caused by hypoxia, improved colonic tissue damage, and effectively increased the content of tight junction proteins in the ileum, reducing ileal permeability and alleviating mechanical barrier damage in the intestines due to acute hypoxia. Additionally, 4L3 helped to rebalance the intestinal microbiota. In summary, this study found that Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain 4L3 could alleviate acute intestinal damage caused by hypoxia, thereby reducing hypoxic stress. This suggests that probiotic lactic acid bacteria that exert beneficial effects in the intestines may alleviate acute injury under hypoxic conditions in mice, offering new insights for the prevention and treatment of AMS.
