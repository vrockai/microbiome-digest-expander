Psoriasis, a chronic and systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by activation of the interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 axis, may be associated with the intestinal microbiota through the so-called "gut-skin axis." Clusterin is a glycoprotein ubiquitously distributed in mammalian tissues; however, its role in psoriasis is unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the role of clusterin in psoriatic skin inflammation, systemic inflammation, and colitis using a murine model of IMQ-induced psoriasis. In IMQ-treated clusterin-knockout (clusterin-/-) mice, the expressions of inflammatory cytokines in clusterin-silenced human keratinocytes and intestinal microbial composition were analyzed. We also examined clusterin expression in the skin tissues of patients with psoriasis. IMQ-induced psoriatic skin inflammation is suppressed in clusterin-/- mice. Long-term administration of IMQ induced systemic inflammation and colitis; however, both were alleviated by the genetic deletion of clusterin. Genetic silencing of clusterin in human keratinocytes inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines involved in the initiation and progression of psoriasis. The composition of the intestinal microbiota in IMQ-treated clusterin-/- and wild-type mice was different. Genetic deletion of clusterin suppressed the increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. Skin tissues of patients with psoriasis showed high clusterin expression. In conclusion, inhibition of clusterin decreased psoriatic skin inflammation, systemic inflammation, colitis, and altered the F/B ratio in an IMQ-induced murine psoriasis model.

The aromatic amino acid L-tryptophan (Trp) is essentially metabolized along the host and microbial pathways. While much is known about the role played by downstream metabolites of each pathways in intestinal homeostasis, their role in lung immune homeostasis is underappreciated. Here we have examined the role played by the Trp hydroxylase/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) pathway in calibrating host and microbial Trp metabolism during Aspergillus fumigatus pneumonia. We found that 5-HT produced by mast cells essentially contributed to pathogen clearance and immune homeostasis in infection by promoting the host protective indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1/kynurenine pathway and limiting the microbial activation of the indole/aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway. This occurred via regulation of lung and intestinal microbiota and signaling pathways. 5-HT was deficient in the sputa of patients with Cystic fibrosis, while 5-HT supplementation restored the dysregulated Trp partitioning in murine disease. These findings suggest that 5-HT, by bridging host-microbiota Trp partitioning, may have clinical effects beyond its mood regulatory function in respiratory pathologies with an inflammatory component.

## High-throughput sequencing analysis of the characteristics of the gut microbiota in aged patients with sarcopenia.
 16.09.2023, _Y Zhang, Y Zhu, Q Guo, W Wang, L Zhang_


The gut microbiota is a complex microbial community that changes in response to various intestinal diseases, including aging-related diseases such as sarcopenia. Several studies have shown that the metabolites of the gut microbiota affect the dynamic balance of the skeletal muscle. However, the effect of gut microbiota imbalance on sarcopenia is still largely unknown.

## The impacts of oral and gut microbiota on alveolar bone loss in periodontitis.
 15.09.2023, _N Han, X Li, J Du, J Xu, L Guo, Y Liu_


Periodontitis, a chronic infectious disease, primarily arises from infections and the invasion of periodontal pathogens. This condition is typified by alveolar bone loss resulting from host immune responses and inflammatory reactions. Periodontal pathogens trigger aberrant inflammatory reactions within periodontal tissues, thereby exacerbating the progression of periodontitis. Simultaneously, these pathogens and metabolites stimulate osteoclast differentiation, which leads to alveolar bone resorption. Moreover, a range of systemic diseases, including diabetes, postmenopausal osteoporosis, obesity and inflammatory bowel disease, can contribute to the development and progression of periodontitis. Many studies have underscored the pivotal role of gut microbiota in bone health through the gut-alveolar bone axis. The circulation may facilitate the transfer of gut pathogens or metabolites to distant alveolar bone, which in turn regulates bone homeostasis. Additionally, gut pathogens can elicit gut immune responses and direct immune cells to remote organs, potentially exacerbating periodontitis. This review summarizes the influence of oral microbiota on the development of periodontitis as well as the association between gut microbiota and periodontitis. By uncovering potential mechanisms of the gut-bone axis, this analysis provides novel insights for the targeted treatment of pathogenic bacteria in periodontitis.

## The synthetic food dye, Red 40, causes DNA damage, causes colonic inflammation, and impacts the microbiome in mice.
 18.09.2023, _Q Zhang, AA Chumanevich, I Nguyen, AA Chumanevich, N Sartawi, J Hogan, M Khazan, Q Harris, B Massey, I Chatzistamou, PJ Buckhaults, CE Banister, M Wirth, JR Hebert, EA Murphy, LJ Hofseth_


The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among young people has been on the rise for the past four decades and its underlying causes are only just starting to be uncovered. Recent studies suggest that consuming ultra-processed foods and pro-inflammatory diets may be contributing factors. The increase in the use of synthetic food colors in such foods over the past 40 years, including the common synthetic food dye Allura Red AC (Red 40), coincides with the rise of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC). As these ultra-processed foods are particularly appealing to children, there is a growing concern about the impact of synthetic food dyes on the development of CRC. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of Red 40 on DNA damage, the microbiome, and colonic inflammation. Despite a lack of prior research, high levels of human exposure to pro-inflammatory foods containing Red 40 highlight the urgency of exploring this issue. Our results show that Red 40 damages DNA both in vitro and in vivo and that consumption of Red 40 in the presence of a high-fat diet for 10 months leads to dysbiosis and low-grade colonic inflammation in mice. This evidence supports the hypothesis that Red 40 is a dangerous compound that dysregulates key players involved in the development of EOCRC.

## Neuroactive metabolites modulated by the gut microbiota in honey bees.
 18.09.2023, _A Cabirol, S Moriano-Gutierrez, P Engel_


Honey bees have emerged as a new model to study the gut-brain axis, as they exhibit complex social behaviors and cognitive abilities, while experiments with gnotobiotic bees have revealed that their gut microbiota alters both brain and behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, while honey bee brain functions supporting a broad range of behaviors have been intensively studied for over 50 years, the gut microbiota of bees has been experimentally characterized only recently. Here, we combined six published datasets from metabolomic analyses to provide an overview of the neuroactive metabolites whose abundance in the gut, hemolymph and brain varies in presence of the gut microbiota. Such metabolites may either be produced by gut bacteria, released from the pollen grains during their decomposition by bacteria, or produced by other organs in response to different bacterial products. We describe the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of such metabolites on brain function and behavior and provide further hypotheses to explore in this emerging field of research.

## Microbiome Assembly in Fermented Foods.
 18.09.2023, _NL Louw, K Lele, R Ye, CB Edwards, BE Wolfe_


_Humans, Fermented Foods, Microbiota_
For thousands of years, humans have enjoyed the novel flavors, increased shelf-life, and nutritional benefits that microbes provide in fermented foods and beverages. Recent sequencing surveys of ferments have mapped patterns of microbial diversity across space, time, and production practices. But a mechanistic understanding of how fermented food microbiomes assemble has only recently begun to emerge. Using three foods as case studies (surface-ripened cheese, sourdough starters, and fermented vegetables), we use an ecological and evolutionary framework to identify how microbial communities assemble in ferments. By combining in situ sequencing surveys with in vitro models, we are beginning to understand how dispersal, selection, diversification, and drift generate the diversity of fermented food communities. Most food producers are unaware of the ecological processes occurring in their production environments, but the theory and models of ecology and evolution can provide new approaches for managing fermented food microbiomes, from farm to ferment.

## Engineering the Maize Root Microbiome: A Rapid MoClo Toolkit and Identification of Potential Bacterial Chassis for Studying Plant-Microbe Interactions.
 15.09.2023, _J van Schaik, Z Li, J Cheadle, N Crook_


Sustainably enhancing crop production is a global necessity to meet the escalating demand for staple crops while sustainably managing their associated carbon/nitrogen inputs. Leveraging plant-associated microbiomes is a promising avenue for addressing this demand. However, studying these communities and engineering them for sustainable enhancement of crop production have remained a challenge due to limited genetic tools and methods. In this work, we detail the development of the Maize Root Microbiome ToolKit (MRMTK), a rapid Modular Cloning (MoClo) toolkit that only takes 2.5 h to generate desired constructs (5400 potential plasmids) that replicate and express heterologous genes in Enterobacter ludwigii strain AA4 (Elu), Pseudomonas putida strain AA7 (Ppu), Herbaspirillum robiniae strain AA6 (Hro), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain AA1 (Sma), and Brucella pituitosa strain AA2 (Bpi), which comprise a model maize root synthetic community (SynCom). In addition to these genetic tools, we describe a highly efficient transformation protocol (107-109 transformants/μg of DNA) 1 for each of these strains. Utilizing this highly efficient transformation protocol, we identified endogenous Expression Sequences (ES; promoter and ribosomal binding sites) for each strain via genomic promoter trapping. Overall, MRMTK is a scalable and adaptable platform that expands the genetic engineering toolbox while providing a standardized, high-efficiency transformation method across a diverse group of root commensals. These results unlock the ability to elucidate and engineer plant-microbe interactions promoting plant growth for each of the 5 bacterial strains in this study.

## Effects of Fe(III) (hydr)oxide mineralogy on the development of microbial communities originating from soil, surface water, groundwater, and aerosols.
 17.09.2023, _Y Zhang, EJ O'Loughlin, SY Park, MJ Kwon_


Microbial Fe(III) reduction is a key component of the iron cycle in natural environments. However, the susceptibility of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides to microbial reduction varies depending on the mineral's crystallinity, and the type of Fe(III) (hydr)oxide in turn will affect the composition of the microbial community. We created microcosm reactors with microbial communities from four different sources (soil, surface water, groundwater, and aerosols), three Fe(III) (hydr)oxides (lepidocrocite, goethite, and hematite) as electron acceptors, and acetate as an electron donor to investigate the shaping effect of Fe(III) mineral type on the development of microbial communities. During a 10-month incubation, changes in microbial community composition, Fe(III) reduction, and acetate utilization were monitored. Overall, there was greater reduction of lepidocrocite than of goethite and hematite, and the development of microbial communities originating from the same source diverged when supplied with different Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. Furthermore, each Fe(III) mineral was associated with unique taxa that emerged from different sources. This study illustrates the taxonomic diversity of Fe(III)-reducing microbes from a broad range of natural environments.

## Combination of sequencing batch reactor activated sludge process with sludge lysis using thermophilic bacterial community for minimizing excess sludge.
 15.09.2023, _B Chi, Y Huang, Z Xiong, J Tan, W Zhou, Z Yang, K Zhou, X Duan, A Chen, K Gui_


Sludge reduction is a major challenge in biological wastewater treatment. Hydrolytic enzymes secreted by thermophilic bacteria can lyse sludge and thus achieve sludge reduction, and the indigenous thermophilic community in sludge can lyse sludge more effectively. In this study, the feasibility of combining a sludge lysis reactor based on thermophilic bacteria community (LTBC reactor, 75 °C) with a conventional sequencing batch activated sludge reactor (SBR) for sludge reduction (i.e., LTBC-SBR process) was systematically investigated first time. The effect of lysed sludge returning to the biochemical tank on pollutant removal efficiency, sludge flocculation, sludge settling, and microbial community and function of the LTBC-SBR process was studied. In the LTBC1-SBR process, a sludge growth rate of 0.71 g TSS/day was observed when the lysed sludge reflux ratio (LRR) was 1, and the sludge generation was reduced by 81.5% compared to the conventional SBR reactor. In the LTBC1-SBR process, the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen were 94.0% and 80.5%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the sludge volume index from the SBR to the LTBC1-SBR stage, however, the effluent suspended solids concentration increased from 35.2 ± 2.1 mg/L to 80.1 ± 5.3 mg/L. This was attributed to the reflux of sludge lysate. In addition, the changes in extracellular polymers content and composition resulted in poor sludge flocculation performance. Heterotrophic bacteria associated with Actinobacteria and Patescibacteria enriched in LTBC1-SBR with relative abundance of 28.51 ± 1.25% and 20.01 ± 1.21%, respectively, which decomposed the macromolecules in the refluxed lysed sludge and contributed to the sludge reduction. Furthermore, due to the inhibition of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, the nitrite concentration in the effluent of the LTBC1-SBR system reached 4.7 ± 1.1 mg/L, and part of the denitrification process was achieved by short-cut nitrification and simultaneous denitrification. These results indicate that in-situ sludge reduction technology based on lyse sludge lysing by thermophilic community has considerable potential to be widely used in wastewater treatment.
