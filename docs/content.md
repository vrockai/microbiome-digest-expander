## Benchmarking microbial growth rate predictions from metagenomes.
 17.09.2020, _AM Long, S Hou, JC Ignacio-Espinoza, JA Fuhrman_


Growth rates are central to understanding microbial interactions and community dynamics. Metagenomic growth estimators have been developed, specifically codon usage bias (CUB) for maximum growth rates and "peak-to-trough ratio" (PTR) for in situ rates. Both were originally tested with pure cultures, but natural populations are more heterogeneous, especially in individual cell histories pertinent to PTR. To test these methods, we compared predictors with observed growth rates of freshly collected marine prokaryotes in unamended seawater. We prefiltered and diluted samples to remove grazers and greatly reduce virus infection, so net growth approximated gross growth. We sampled over 44 h for abundances and metagenomes, generating 101 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, SAR406, MGII archaea, etc. We tracked each MAG population by cell-abundance-normalized read recruitment, finding growth rates of 0 to 5.99 per day, the first reported rates for several groups, and used these rates as benchmarks. PTR, calculated by three methods, rarely correlated to growth (r ~-0.26-0.08), except for rapidly growing γ-Proteobacteria (r ~0.63-0.92), while CUB correlated moderately well to observed maximum growth rates (r = 0.57). This suggests that current PTR approaches poorly predict actual growth of most marine bacterial populations, but maximum growth rates can be approximated from genomic characteristics.

## Gut microbial metabolites as multi-kingdom intermediates.
 24.09.2020, _KA Krautkramer, J Fan, F Bäckhed_


The gut microbiota contributes to host physiology through the production of a myriad of metabolites. These metabolites exert their effects within the host as signalling molecules and substrates for metabolic reactions. Although the study of host-microbiota interactions remains challenging due to the high degree of crosstalk both within and between kingdoms, metabolite-focused research has identified multiple actionable microbial targets that are relevant for host health. Metabolites, as the functional output of combined host and microorganism interactions, provide a snapshot in time of an extraordinarily complex multi-organism system. Although substantial work remains towards understanding host-microbiota interactions and the underlying mechanisms, we review the current state of knowledge for each of the major classes of microbial metabolites with emphasis on clinical and translational research implications. We provide an overview of methodologies available for measurement of microbial metabolites, and in addition to discussion of key challenges, we provide a potential framework for integration of discovery-based metabolite studies with mechanistic work. Finally, we highlight examples in the literature where this approach has led to substantial progress in understanding host-microbiota interactions.

## Integration of absolute multi-omics reveals dynamic protein-to-RNA ratios and metabolic interplay within mixed-domain microbiomes.
 22.09.2020, _F Delogu, BJ Kunath, PN Evans, MØ Arntzen, TR Hvidsten, PB Pope_


While the field of microbiology has adapted to the study of complex microbiomes via modern meta-omics techniques, we have not updated our basic knowledge regarding the quantitative levels of DNA, RNA and protein molecules within a microbial cell, which ultimately control cellular function. Here we report the temporal measurements of absolute RNA and protein levels per gene within a mixed bacterial-archaeal consortium. Our analysis of this data reveals an absolute protein-to-RNA ratio of 102-104 for bacterial populations and 103-105 for an archaeon, which is more comparable to Eukaryotic representatives' humans and yeast. Furthermore, we use the linearity between the metaproteome and metatranscriptome over time to identify core functional guilds, hence using a fundamental biological feature (i.e., RNA/protein levels) to highlight phenotypical complementarity. Our findings show that upgrading multi-omic toolkits with traditional absolute measurements unlocks the scaling of core biological questions to dynamic and complex microbiomes, creating a deeper insight into inter-organismal relationships that drive the greater community function.

## Macrophages Maintain Epithelium Integrity by Limiting Fungal Product Absorption.
 24.09.2020, _AS Chikina, F Nadalin, M Maurin, M San-Roman, T Thomas-Bonafos, XV Li, S Lameiras, S Baulande, S Henri, B Malissen, L Lacerda Mariano, J Barbazan, JM Blander, ID Iliev, D Matic Vignjevic, AM Lennon-Duménil_


The colon is primarily responsible for absorbing fluids. It contains a large number of microorganisms including fungi, which are enriched in its distal segment. The colonic mucosa must therefore tightly regulate fluid influx to control absorption of fungal metabolites, which can be toxic to epithelial cells and lead to barrier dysfunction. How this is achieved remains unknown. Here, we describe a mechanism by which the innate immune system allows rapid quality check of absorbed fluids to avoid intoxication of colonocytes. This mechanism relies on a population of distal colon macrophages that are equipped with "balloon-like" protrusions (BLPs) inserted in the epithelium, which sample absorbed fluids. In the absence of macrophages or BLPs, epithelial cells keep absorbing fluids containing fungal products, leading to their death and subsequent loss of epithelial barrier integrity. These results reveal an unexpected and essential role of macrophages in the maintenance of colon-microbiota interactions in homeostasis.

Alterations of gut microbiota may play a role in Anorexia Nervosa (AN) through perturbations of the gut-brain axis. Some studies found differences in the gut microbiota of patients with AN compared to healthy controls, but results are heterogeneous. The aim of this work was to systematically review the existing studies comparing gut microbial composition in AN and healthy controls, and to perform a quantitative synthesis of the pooled clinical and microbiological data, when available.

## The vaginal microbiome in pregnant women: knowledge gaps in relation to clinical relevance.
 24.09.2020, _SS Witkin, AF Moron, IM Linhares, DW Skupski_


The use of culture-independent assays to determine the composition of the vaginal microbiota in pregnant women has greatly improved our knowledge of the diversity and relative abundance of bacteria present. However, despite advances in bacterial gene amplification technology and computer-assisted determination of microbial composition down to the strain level (even more specific than species), gaps remain in our knowledge of how racial, genetic and clinical factors affect vaginal microbiome composition and its sequelae.

## Novel antibiotic-loaded particles conferring eradication of deep tissue bacterial reservoirs for the treatment of chronic urinary tract infection.
 27.09.2020, _WK Lau, D Dharmasena, H Horsley, NV Jafari, J Malone-Lee, E Stride, M Edirisinghe, JL Rohn_


A significant proportion of urinary tract infection (UTI) patients experience recurrent episodes, due to deep tissue infection and treatment-resistant bacterial reservoirs. Direct bladder instillation of antibiotics has proved disappointing in treating UTI, likely due to the failure of infused antibiotics to penetrate the bladder epithelium and accumulate to high enough levels to kill intracellular bacteria. This work investigates the use of nitrofurantoin loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles to improve delivery to intracellular targets for the treatment of chronic UTI. Using electrohydrodynamic atomisation, we produced particles with an average diameter of 2.8 μm. In broth culture experiments, the biodegradable particles were effective against a number of UTI-relevant bacterial strains. Dye-loaded particles demonstrated that intracellular delivery was achieved in all cells in 2D cultures of a human bladder epithelial progenitor cell line in a dose-dependent manner, achieving far higher efficiency and concentration than equivalent quantities of free drug. Time-lapse video microscopy confirmed that delivery occurred within 30 min of administration, to 100% of cells. Moreover, the particles were able to deliver the drug to cells through multiple layers of a 3D human bladder organoid model causing minimal cell toxicity, displaying superior killing of bacterial reservoirs harboured within bladder cells compared with unencapsulated drug. The particles were also able to kill bacterial biofilms more effectively than the free drug. These results illustrate the potential for using antibiotic-loaded microparticles to effectively treat chronic UTIs. Such a delivery method could be extrapolated to other clinical indications where robust intracellular delivery is required, such as oncology and gene therapy.

## Habitat disturbance influences the skin microbiome of a rediscovered neotropical-montane frog.
 24.09.2020, _RR Jiménez, G Alvarado, J Sandoval, S Sommer_


The skin microbiome serves as a first line defense against pathogens in vertebrates. In amphibians, it has the potential to protect against the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatis (Bd), a likely agent of amphibian declines. Alteration of the microbiome associated with unfavorable environmental changes produced by anthropogenic activities may make the host more susceptible to pathogens. Some amphibian species that were thought to be "extinct" have been rediscovered years after population declines in the late 1980s probably due to evolved Bd-resistance and are now threatened by anthropogenic land-use changes. Understanding the effects of habitat disturbance on the host skin microbiome is relevant for understanding the health of these species, along with its susceptibility to pathogens such as Bd. Here, we investigate the influence of habitat alteration on the skin bacterial communities as well as specifically the putative Bd-inhibitory bacterial communities of the montane frog Lithobates vibicarius. This species, after years of not being observed, was rediscovered in small populations inhabiting undisturbed and disturbed landscapes, and with continuous presence of Bd.

## A network approach to elucidate and prioritize microbial dark matter in microbial communities.
 23.09.2020, _T Zamkovaya, JS Foster, V de Crécy-Lagard, A Conesa_


Microbes compose most of the biomass on the planet, yet the majority of taxa remain uncharacterized. These unknown microbes, often referred to as "microbial dark matter," represent a major challenge for biology. To understand the ecological contributions of these Unknown taxa, it is essential to first understand the relationship between unknown species, neighboring microbes, and their respective environment. Here, we establish a method to study the ecological significance of "microbial dark matter" by building microbial co-occurrence networks from publicly available 16S rRNA gene sequencing data of four extreme aquatic habitats. For each environment, we constructed networks including and excluding unknown organisms at multiple taxonomic levels and used network centrality measures to quantitatively compare networks. When the Unknown taxa were excluded from the networks, a significant reduction in degree and betweenness was observed for all environments. Strikingly, Unknown taxa occurred as top hubs in all environments, suggesting that "microbial dark matter" play necessary ecological roles within their respective communities. In addition, novel adaptation-related genes were detected after using 16S rRNA gene sequences from top-scoring hub taxa as probes to blast metagenome databases. This work demonstrates the broad applicability of network metrics to identify and prioritize key Unknown taxa and improve understanding of ecosystem structure across diverse habitats.

## A survey of psychological practitioner workplace wellbeing.
 26.09.2020, _EMA Summers, RC Morris, GE Bhutani, AS Rao, JC Clarke_


The wellbeing of the psychological workforce is an area of concern. However, it has been sparsely studied in an holistic manner encompassing workplace wellbeing as well as burnout. This study reports a survey of 1,678 psychological practitioners accessed through professional networks. The short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) and the Psychological Practitioner Workplace Wellbeing Measure (PPWWM) were administered with a demographic questionnaire. The mean for the SWEMWBS was below that of a national population survey. The inter-correlation of these tests was.61. Subgroup analyses showed significant differences: assistant psychologists, counsellors and psychological wellbeing practitioners demonstrated better than average workplace wellbeing. But for general wellbeing (SWEMWBS) trainee clinical psychologists and assistant psychologists showed lower than average wellbeing while psychological wellbeing practitioners were higher than average. Other factors associated with wellbeing were: contract type -both measures (higher workplace wellbeing in those with temporary contracts and the self-employed); employment sector -for PPWWM only (private organisation/independent workers and third sector/charitable organisation workers scored above the PPWWM mean); ethnicity - for both measures (Asian groups except Chinese had higher wellbeing than average for the PPWWM and SWEMWBS); disability was strongly associated with lower wellbeing on both measures. Harassment, feeling depressed or a failure and wanting to leave the NHS were associated with lower wellbeing. Greater age, pay and years of service were negatively correlated with wellbeing. A five-factor structure was obtained with this sample. The results confirmed psychological practitioners as an at-risk group and identified a number of factors associated with workplace wellbeing.

## Shift work influences the outcomes of Chlamydia infection and pathogenesis.
 22.09.2020, _SR Lundy, S Richardson, A Ramsey, D Ellerson, Y Fengxia, S Onyeabor, W Kirlin, W Thompson, CM Black, JP DeBruyne, AJ Davidson, LC Immergluck, U Blas-Machado, FO Eko, JU Igietseme, Q He, YO Omosun_


Shift work, performed by approximately 21 million Americans, is irregular or unusual work schedule hours occurring after 6:00 pm. Shift work has been shown to disrupt circadian rhythms and is associated with several adverse health outcomes and chronic diseases such as cancer, gastrointestinal and psychiatric diseases and disorders. It is unclear if shift work influences the complications associated with certain infectious agents, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility resulting from genital chlamydial infection. We used an Environmental circadian disruption (ECD) model mimicking circadian disruption occurring during shift work, where mice had a 6-h advance in the normal light/dark cycle (LD) every week for a month. Control group mice were housed under normal 12/12 LD cycle. Our hypothesis was that compared to controls, mice that had their circadian rhythms disrupted in this ECD model will have a higher Chlamydia load, more pathology and decreased fertility rate following Chlamydia infection. Results showed that, compared to controls, mice that had their circadian rhythms disrupted (ECD) had higher Chlamydia loads, more tissue alterations or lesions, and lower fertility rate associated with chlamydial infection. Also, infected ECD mice elicited higher proinflammatory cytokines compared to mice under normal 12/12 LD cycle. These results imply that there might be an association between shift work and the increased likelihood of developing more severe disease from Chlamydia infection.
