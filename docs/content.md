## [Gut microbiome, metabolites, and tissue metabolism in graft-versus-host disease].
 03.05.2022, _H Fujiwara_


_Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Graft vs Host Disease, Homeostasis, Humans, Microbiota_
Immune reactions promote not only graft-versus-tumor events but also graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) characterized by the activation of T-cells and antigen-presenting cells. Recent studies have unveiled the effects of microbial flora on GVHD and brought the mechanism other than immune cells. The role of tissue-intrinsic factors contributes to target-tissue resilience, repair, and regeneration and mitigates the severity of GVHD without altering alloreactive immune cells. Antibiotics, specific bacteria, and low microbiota diversity are identified as risk factors for GVHD and mortality. The current focus has shifted to target-tissue homeostasis in GVHD. Most of the gut microbiota symbiotically colonize the gut, and this homeostasis is finely tuned in the gastrointestinal tract, which has a relatively hypoxic environment dominated by anaerobic organisms. Therefore, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are uniquely adapted to this hypoxic environment, and cells programmed by "physiological hypoxia" tonally regulate barrier function with commensal bacteria. Metabolic changes in IECs post allo-HCT can affect the gut environment, leading to dysbiosis. This review focuses on the role of metabolism in IECs with microbiota and microbial metabolites in the GVHD setting to promote tissue tolerance.

## High-Throughput Profiling of Root-Associated Microbial Communities.

Roots of healthy plants are colonized by a great diversity of bacteria and fungi but also other microorganisms that are collectively referred to as the root microbiota. Root microbiota composition is shaped by environmental cues, by host genetics, but also by microbe-microbe interactions, and recent evidence indicates that a direct link exists between root microbiota assembly and host health. In order to characterize the root microbiota or to study the complex interplay between plants and their associated microbes, the assessment of microbial community structure via marker gene amplicon sequencing has become a key tool. Herein, we present detailed methods for the preparation of 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon libraries to characterize Arabidopsis thaliana-associated bacterial and fungal communities along the soil-root continuum. The protocols can be easily adapted for different host organs or plant species.

## Barley Resistance to Fusarium graminearum Infections: From Transcriptomics to Field with Food Safety Concerns.
 09.11.2022, _A Hameed, P Poznanski, M Noman, T Ahmed, A Iqbal, A Nadolska-Orczyk, W Orczyk_


Global climate change and the urgency to transform food crops require substantial breeding efforts to meet the food security challenges. Barley, an important cereal, has remained a preferential host of phytotoxic diseases caused by the Fusarium graminearum that not only severely reduces the crop yield but also compromises its food quality due to the accumulation of mycotoxins. To develop resistance against Fusarium infections, a better understanding of the host-pathogen interaction is inevitable and could be tracked through molecular insights. Here, we focused precisely on the potential gene targets that are exclusive to this devastating pathosystem and could be harnessed for fast breeding of barley. We also discuss the eco-friendly applications of nanobio hybrid and the CRISPR technology for barley protection. This review covers the critical information gaps within the subject and may be useful for the sustainable improvement of barley from the perspective of food and environmental safety concerns.
