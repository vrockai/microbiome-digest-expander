## The Influence of Gut Microbiota on the Cardiovascular System Under Conditions of Obesity and Chronic Stress.
 21.05.2021, _P Dubinski, K Czarzasta, A Cudnoch-Jedrzejewska_


Based on the available data, it can be assumed that microbiota is an integral part of the human body. The most heavily colonized area of the human body is the gut, with bacterial accumulation ranging from 101-103 cells/g in the upper intestine to 1011-1012 cells/g in the colon. However, colonization of the gut is not the same throughout, as it was shown that there are differences between the composition of the microbiota in the intestine lumen and in the proximity of the mucus layer.

## Restoration of dysbiotic human gut microbiome for homeostasis.
 23.05.2021, _K Dixit, D Chaudhari, D Dhotre, Y Shouche, S Saroj_


The human microbiome is a complex and dynamic ecosystem, and the imbalance of its microbial community structure from the normal state is termed dysbiosis. The dysbiotic gut microbiome has been proved to be related to several pathological conditions like Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Colorectal Cancer (CRC), etc., and several other extra-intestinal conditions like Type 1 &amp; 2 diabetes, obesity, etc. The complex gut microbial ecosystem starts to build before the birth of an individual. It is known to get affected by several factors such as birth mode, individual lifestyle, dietary practices, medications, and antibiotics. A dysbiotic microbiome can potentially hamper host homeostasis due to its role in immune modulation, metabolism, nutrient synthesis, etc. Restoration of the dysbiotic gut microbiome has emerged as a promising aid and a better therapeutic approach. Several approaches have been investigated to achieve this goal, including prebiotics and probiotics, Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT), extracellular vesicles, immune modulation, microbial metabolites, dietary interventions, and phages. This review discusses the various factors that influence the human microbiome with respect to their cause-effect relationship and the effect of gut microbiome compositional changes on the brain through the gut-brain axis. We also discuss the practices used globally for gut microbiome restoration purposes, along with their effectiveness.

## The role of microbiome in colorectal carcinogenesis and its clinical potential as a target for cancer treatment.
 20.05.2021, _SH Kim, YJ Lim_


The role of gut microbiome-intestinal immune complex in the development of colorectal cancer and its progression is well recognized. Accordingly, certain microbial strains tend to colonize or vanish in patients with colorectal cancer. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are expected to exhibit both anti-tumor effects and chemopreventive effects during cancer treatment through mechanisms such as xenometabolism, immune interactions, and altered eco-community. Microbial modulation can also be safely used to prevent complications during peri-operational periods of colorectal surgery. A deeper understanding of the role of intestinal microbiota as a target for colorectal cancer treatment will lead the way to a better prognosis for colorectal cancer patients.

## Synbiotics improve clinical indicators of ulcerative colitis: systematic review with meta-analysis.
 19.05.2021, _MN Rufino, AL da Costa, EN Jorge, VF Paiano, ML Camparoto, R Keller, H Bremer-Neto_


Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic, relapsing diseases that compromise life quality and expectancy. The increased incidence and prevalence of these diseases reinforce the need for research on prevention, therapy, and management innovations. Synbiotics (ie, probiotic plus prebiotic combinations) are suggested as an alternative or complementary therapy to conventional treatments for inflammatory bowel disease.

## Genotypic and Phenotypic Diversity among Human Isolates of Akkermansia muciniphila.
 19.05.2021, _B Becken, L Davey, DR Middleton, KD Mueller, A Sharma, ZC Holmes, E Dallow, B Remick, GM Barton, LA David, JR McCann, SC Armstrong, P Malkus, RH Valdivia_


The mucophilic anaerobic bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila is a prominent member of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota and the only known species of the Verrucomicrobia phylum in the mammalian gut. A high prevalence of A. muciniphila in adult humans is associated with leanness and a lower risk for the development of obesity and diabetes. Four distinct A. muciniphila phylogenetic groups have been described, but little is known about their relative abundance in humans or how they impact human metabolic health. In this study, we isolated and characterized 71 new A. muciniphila strains from a cohort of children and adolescents undergoing treatment for obesity. Based on genomic and phenotypic analysis of these strains, we found several phylogroup-specific phenotypes that may impact the colonization of the GI tract or modulate host functions, such as oxygen tolerance, adherence to epithelial cells, iron and sulfur metabolism, and bacterial aggregation. In antibiotic-treated mice, phylogroups AmIV and AmII outcompeted AmI strains. In children and adolescents, AmI strains were most prominent, but we observed high variance in A. muciniphila abundance and single phylogroup dominance, with phylogroup switching occurring in a small subset of patients. Overall, these results highlight that the ecological principles determining which A. muciniphila phylogroup predominates in humans are complex and that A. muciniphila strain genetic and phenotypic diversity may represent an important variable that should be taken into account when making inferences as to this microbe's impact on its host's health.IMPORTANCE The abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is linked to multiple positive health outcomes. There are four known A. muciniphila phylogroups, yet the prevalence of these phylogroups and how they vary in their ability to influence human health is largely unknown. In this study, we performed a genomic and phenotypic analysis of 71 A. muciniphila strains and identified phylogroup-specific traits such as oxygen tolerance, adherence, and sulfur acquisition that likely influence colonization of the GI tract and differentially impact metabolic and immunological health. In humans, we observed that single Akkermansia phylogroups predominate at a given time but that the phylotype can switch in an individual. This collection of strains provides the foundation for the functional characterization of A. muciniphila phylogroup-specific effects on the multitude of host outcomes associated with Akkermansia colonization, including protection from obesity, diabetes, colitis, and neurological diseases, as well as enhanced responses to cancer immunotherapies.

## Maternal precarity and HPA axis functioning shape infant gut microbiota and HPA axis development in humans.
 20.05.2021, _JR Jahnke, J Roach, MA Azcarate-Peril, AL Thompson_


Early life exposure to adverse environments, and maternal stress in particular, has been shown to increase risk for metabolic diseases and neurobehavioral disorders. While many studies have examined the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) as the primary mechanism behind these relationships, emerging research on the brain-gut axis suggests that the microbiome may play a role. In this study, we tested the relationships among maternal precarity and HPA axis dysregulation during the peripartum period, infant gut microbiome composition, and infant HPA axis functioning.

## Profiling of tumour-associated microbiota in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
 20.05.2021, _S Komiyama, T Yamada, N Takemura, N Kokudo, K Hase, YI Kawamura_


Liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary liver cancer that results from chronic hepatitis caused by multiple predisposing factors such as viral infection, alcohol consumption, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Accumulating studies have indicated that dysfunction of the gut epithelial barrier and hepatic translocation of gut microbes may be implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC. However, the translocated bacteria in HCC patients remains unclear. Here, we characterised tumour-associated microbiota in patients with liver cancer and focused on HCC. We observed that the number of amplicon sequence variants in tumour-associated microbiota was significantly higher compared with that in non-tumour regions of the liver. The tumour-associated microbiota consisted of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria as the dominant phyla. We identified an unclassified genus that belonged to the Bacteroides, Romboutsia, uncultured bacterium of Lachnospiraceae as a signature taxon for primary liver cancer. Additionally, we identified Ruminococcus gnavus as a signature taxon for HCC patients infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C viruses. This study suggests that tumour microbiota may contribute to the pathology of HCC.

## Perceived Stress and Molecular-BV in the NIH Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora.
 19.05.2021, _R Turpin, N Slopen, JC Borgogna, CJ Yeoman, X He, RS Miller, MA Klebanoff, J Ravel, RM Brotman_


Vaginal microbiota provide the first line of defense against urogenital infections primarily through protective actions of Lactobacillus spp. Perceived stress increases susceptibility to infection through several mechanisms, including suppression of immune function. We investigated if stress was associated with deleterious changes to vaginal bacterial composition in a subsample of 572 women in the Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora, sampled from 1999 through 2002. Using Cox proportional-hazard models, both unadjusted and adjusted for sociodemographics and sexual behaviors, participants who exhibited a 5 unit-increase in Cohen's perceived stress scale had greater risk (aHR=1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.74) of developing molecular bacterial vaginosis (BV), a state with low Lactobacillus abundance and diverse anaerobic bacteria. A 5-unit stress increase was also associated with greater risks for transitioning from the L. iners-dominated community state type (26% higher) to molecular-BV (aHR=1.26, 95% CI 1.01-1.56) or maintaining molecular-BV from baseline (aHR=1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.47). Inversely, women with baseline molecular-BV reporting a 5-unit stress increase were less likely to transition to microbiota dominated by L. crispatus, L. gasseri, or L. jensenii (aHR=0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.99). These findings suggest psychosocial stress is associated with vaginal microbiota composition, inviting a more mechanistic exploration of the relationship between psychosocial stress and molecular-BV.

## Genetically Programmable Microbial Assembly.
 19.05.2021, _MT Kozlowski, BR Silverman, CP Johnstone, DA Tirrell_


Engineered microbial communities show promise in a wide range of applications, including environmental remediation, microbiome engineering, and synthesis of fine chemicals. Here we present methods by which bacterial aggregates can be directed into several distinct architectures by inducible surface expression of heteroassociative protein domains (SpyTag/SpyCatcher and SynZip17/18). Programmed aggregation can be used to activate a quorum-sensing circuit, and aggregate size can be tuned via control of the amount of the associative protein displayed on the cell surface. We further demonstrate reversibility of SynZip-mediated assembly by addition of soluble competitor peptide. Genetically programmable bacterial assembly provides a starting point for the development of new applications of engineered microbial communities in environmental technology, agriculture, human health, and bioreactor design.

## Regulatory role of the intestinal microbiota in the immune response against Giardia.
 20.05.2021, _B Maertens, A Gagnaire, O Paerewijck, K De Bosscher, P Geldhof_


Giardia duodenalis is one of the most commonly found intestinal parasites in mammalian hosts. Infections can generally be cleared by mounting an adequate protective immune response that is orchestrated through IL-17A. This study was aimed to investigate if and how the intestinal microbiome affects the protective Th17 response against Giardia by analysing and comparing the immune response following a G. muris and G. duodenalis infection in antibiotic treated and untreated mice. Depletion of the intestinal flora by antibiotic treatment had a severe effect on the infection dynamics of both Giardia species. Not only duration of infection was affected, but also the parasite burden increased significantly. Markers associated with a protective immune response, such as IL-17A and mannose binding lectin 2 were still significantly upregulated following infection in the antibiotic-treated mice, despite the lack of protection. On the other hand, the antibiotic treatment significantly decreased the level of IgA in the intestinal lumen by affecting its transporter and by reducing the number of IgA+ B-cells at the Peyer's patches. Furthermore, the depletion of the gut microbiota by antibiotics also significantly lowered the intestinal motility. The combination of these factors likely results in a decreased clearance of the parasite from the intestinal tract.

## Role of microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunctions induced by infections in the onset of anorexia nervosa.
 19.05.2021, _M Galmiche, N Achamrah, P Déchelotte, D Ribet, J Breton_


Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder characterized by low food intake, severe body weight loss, intense fear of gaining weight, and dysmorphophobia. This chronic disease is associated with both psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. Over the years, clinical studies have accumulated evidence that viral or bacterial infections may promote the onset of eating disorders such as AN. This review aims to describe how infections and the subsequent immune responses affect food intake regulation in the short term and also how these processes may lead to long-term intestinal disorders, including gut barrier disruption and gut microbiota dysbiosis, even after the clearance of the pathogens. We discuss in particular how infection-mediated intestinal dysbiosis may promote the onset of several AN symptoms and comorbidities, including appetite dysregulation, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and mood disorders.

## Stability of the human gut virome and effect of gluten-free diet.

The human gut microbiome consists of bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and viruses. The gut viruses are relatively underexplored. Here, we longitudinally analyzed the gut virome composition in 11 healthy adults: its stability, variation, and the effect of a gluten-free diet. Using viral enrichment and a de novo assembly-based approach, we demonstrate the quantitative dynamics of the gut virome, including dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, and ssRNA viruses. We observe highly divergent individual viral communities, carrying on an average 2,143 viral genomes, 13.1% of which were present at all 3 time points. In contrast to previous reports, the Siphoviridae family dominates over Microviridae in studied individual viromes. We also show individual viromes to be stable at the family level but to vary substantially at the genera and species levels. Finally, we demonstrate that lower initial diversity of the human gut virome leads to a more pronounced effect of the dietary intervention on its composition.

## Early-Life Immune System Maturation in Chickens Using a Synthetic Community of Cultured Gut Bacteria.
 19.05.2021, _C Zenner, TCA Hitch, T Riedel, E Wortmann, S Tiede, EM Buhl, B Abt, K Neuhaus, P Velge, J Overmann, B Kaspers, T Clavel_


The gut microbiome is crucial for both maturation of the immune system and colonization resistance against enteric pathogens. Although chicken are important domesticated animals, the impact of their gut microbiome on the immune system is understudied. Therefore, we investigated the effect of microbiome-based interventions on host mucosal immune responses. Increased levels of IgA and IgY were observed in chickens exposed to maternal feces after hatching compared with strict hygienic conditions. This was accompanied by increased gut bacterial diversity as assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Cultivation work allowed the establishment of a collection of 43 bacterial species spanning 4 phyla and 19 families, including the first cultured members of 3 novel genera and 4 novel species that were taxonomically described. This resource is available at www.dsmz.de/chibac A synthetic community consisting of nine phylogenetically diverse and dominant species from this collection was designed and found to be moderately efficient in boosting immunoglobulin levels when provided to chickens early in life.IMPORTANCE The immune system plays a crucial role in sustaining animal health. Its development is markedly influenced by early microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. As chicken are fully dependent on environmental microbes after hatching, extensive hygienic measures in production facilities are detrimental to the microbiota, resulting in low colonization resistance against pathogens. To combat enteric infections, antibiotics are frequently used, which aggravates the issue by altering gut microbiota colonization. Intervention strategies based on cultured gut bacteria are proposed to influence immune responses in chicken.

## Utilizing the Microbiota and Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess Risk of Salmonella Contamination in Poultry Rinsate.
 20.05.2021, _H Bolinger, D Tran, K Harary, GC Paoli, G Guron, H Namazi, R Khaksar_


Traditional microbiological testing methods are slow, and many molecular-based techniques rely on culture-based enrichment to overcome low limits of detection. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies may make it possible to utilize machine learning (ML) to identify patterns in microbiome data to potentially predict the presence or absence of pathogens. In this study, 299 poultry rinsate samples from various points in the processing chain were analyzed to determine if microbiota could inform about a sample's risk for containing Salmonella . Samples were culture confirmed as Salmonella -positive or -negative following modified USDA MLG protocols. The culture confirmation result was used as a reference to compare with 16S sequencing data. Pre-chill samples tested positive (71/82) at a higher frequency than post-chill samples (30/217) and contained greater microbial diversity. Due to their larger sample size, post-chill samples were analyzed more deeply. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) identified a significant effect of chilling on the number of genera (p&lt;0.001), but analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) failed to provide evidence for microbial dissimilarity between pre- and post-chill samples (p=0.001, R=0.443). Various ML models were trained using post-chill samples to predict if a sample contained Salmonella based on the samples' microbiota pre-enrichment. The optimal model was a Random Forest-based model with a performance as follows: accuracy (88%), sensitivity (85%), specificity (90%). While the algorithms described in this paper are prototypes, these risk-based algorithms demonstrate the potential and need for further studies to provide insight alongside diagnostic tests. Combining risk-based information with diagnostic tools can help poultry processors make informed decisions to help identify and prevent the spread of Salmonella . These data add to the growing body of literature exploring novel ways to utilize microbiome data for predictive food safety.

Phenotypic variability for productive and meat quality traits has been largely studied in Iberian pigs, especially in genetic selection and nutritional experiments. Complex interactions among genetic background, diet composition and gut microbiota hinder the correct assessment of each factor's contribution on phenotypes. In order to disentangle these interactions, we evaluated changes in gut microbiota composition comparing 48 Iberian and Duroc pigs fed diets with different energy source (standard diet with carbohydrates vs sunflower oil-enriched diet with high oleic acid content).

## Predictable and host-species specific humanization of the gut microbiota in captive primates.
 20.05.2021, _JL Houtz, JG Sanders, A Denice, AH Moeller_


Humans and non-human primates (NHPs) harbor complex gut microbial communities that affect phenotypes and fitness. The gut microbiotas of wild NHPs reflect their hosts' phylogenetic histories and are compositionally distinct from those of humans, but in captivity the endogenous gut microbial lineages of NHPs can be lost or replaced by lineages found in humans. Despite its potential contributions to gastrointestinal dysfunction, this humanization of the gut microbiota has not been investigated systematically across captive NHP species. Here we show through comparisons of well-sampled wild and captive populations of apes and monkeys that the fraction of the gut microbiota humanized by captivity varies significantly between NHP species but is remarkably reproducible between captive populations of the same NHP species. Conspecific captive populations displayed significantly greater than expected overlap in the sets of bacterial 16S rRNA gene variants that were differentially abundant between captivity and the wild. This overlap was evident even between captive populations residing on different continents but was never observed between heterospecific captive populations. In addition, we developed an approach incorporating human gut microbiota data to rank NHPs' gut microbial clades based on the propensity of their lineages to be lost or replaced by lineages found in humans in captivity. Relatively few microbial genera displayed reproducible degrees of humanization in different captive host species, but most microbial genera were reproducibly humanized or retained from the wild in conspecific pairs of captive populations. These results demonstrate that the gut microbiotas of captive NHPs display predictable, host-species specific responses to captivity.

A healthy microbiome influences host physiology through a mutualistic relationship, which can be important for the host to cope with cellular stress by promoting fitness and survival. The mammalian microbiome is highly complex and attributing host phenotypes to a specific member of the microbiome can be difficult. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans and its native microbiome, discovered recently, can serve as a more tractable, experimental model system to study host-microbiome interactions. In this study, we investigated whether certain members of C. elegans native microbiome would offer a benefit to their host and putative molecular mechanisms using a combination of phenotype screening, omics profiling and functional validation.

## Unraveling the predictive role of temperature in the gut microbiota of the sea urchin Echinometra sp. EZ across spatial and temporal gradients.
 19.05.2021, _RN Ketchum, EG Smith, GO Vaughan, D McParland, N Al-Mansoori, JA Burt, AM Reitzel_


Shifts in microbial communities represent a rapid response mechanism for host organisms to respond to changes in environmental conditions. Therefore, they are likely to be important in assisting the acclimatization of hosts to seasonal temperature changes as well as to variation in temperatures across a species' range. The Persian/Arabian Gulf is the world's warmest sea, with large seasonal fluctuations in temperature (20 °C - 37 °C) and is connected to the Gulf of Oman which experiences more typical oceanic conditions (&lt;32 °C in the summer). This system is an informative model for understanding how symbiotic microbial assemblages respond to thermal variation across temporal and spatial scales. Here, we elucidate the role of temperature on the microbial gut community of the sea urchin Echinometra sp. EZ and identify microbial taxa that are tightly correlated with the thermal environment. We generated two independent datasets with a high degree of geographic and temporal resolution. The results show that microbial communities vary across thermally variable habitats, display temporal shifts that correlate with temperature, and can become more disperse as temperatures rise. The relative abundances of several of the same ASVs significantly correlate with temperature in both independent datasets despite the &gt;300 km distance between the furthest sites and the extreme seasonal variations. Notably, over 50% of the ASVs identified from the two datasets belonged to the family Vibrionaceae. Together, our results identify temperature as a robust predictor of community-level variation and putatively highlight specific microbial taxa involved in the response to thermal environment.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ingestion of live (9 log CFU mL-1) and ultrasound-inactivated (paraprobiotic, 20 kHz, 40 min) Lacticaseibacillus casei 01 cells for 28 days on healthy parameters (biochemical and cardiovascular) and intestinal microbiota (amplicon sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA) of rats fed a high-fat diet. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into four groups of six animals: CTL (standard diet), HFD (high-fat diet), HFD-LC (high-fat diet and live L. casei), and HFD-ILC (high-fat diet and inactivated L. casei). The administration of live and ultrasound-inactivated L. casei prevented the increase (p &lt; 0.05) in cholesterol levels (total and LDL) and controlled the insulin resistance in rats fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, it promoted a modulation of the intestinal microbial composition by increasing (p &lt; 0.05) beneficial bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Ruminoccocaceae) and decreasing (p &lt; 0.05) harmful bacteria (Clostridiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Helicobacteriacea), attenuating the effects promoted by the HFD ingestion. Only live cells could increase (p &lt; 0.05) the HDL-cholesterol, while only inactivated cells caused attenuation (p &lt; 0.05) of the blood pressure. Results show beneficial effects of live and inactivated L. casei 01 and indicate that ultrasound inactivation produces a paraprobiotic with similar or improved health properties compared to live cells.

## Glycan-based shaping of the microbiota during primate evolution.
 22.05.2021, _S Singh, P Bastos-Amador, JA Thompson, M Truglio, B Yilmaz, S Cardoso, D Sobral, MP Soares_


Genes encoding glycosyltransferases can be under relatively high selection pressure, likely due to the involvement of the glycans synthesized in host-microbe interactions. Here, we used mice as an experimental model system to investigate whether loss of α-1,3-galactosyltransferase gene (GGTA1) function and Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-R (αGal) glycan expression affects host-microbiota interactions, as might have occurred during primate evolution. We found that Ggta1 deletion shaped the composition of the gut microbiota. This occurred via an immunoglobulin (Ig)-dependent mechanism, associated with targeting of αGal-expressing bacteria by IgA. Systemic infection with an Ig-shaped microbiota inoculum elicited a less severe form of sepsis compared to infection with non-Ig-shaped microbiota. This suggests that in the absence of host αGal, antibodies can shape the microbiota towards lower pathogenicity. Given the fitness cost imposed by bacterial sepsis, we infer that the observed reduction in microbiota pathogenicity upon Ggta1 deletion in mice may have contributed to increase the frequency of GGTA1 loss-of-function mutations in ancestral primates that gave rise to humans.

## Regulatory effect of non-starch polysaccharides from purple sweet potato on intestinal microbiota of mice with antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
 19.05.2021, _N Bie, S Duan, M Meng, M Guo, C Wang_


Antibiotic treatment causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), which is usually accompanied by disorders of the intestinal flora, aggravating the patient's condition. Recently, more attention has been devoted to the ability of plant polysaccharides to improve the body's flora and enhance immunity. However, reports on whether purple sweet potato polysaccharides (PSPPs) can improve AAD are scarce. This study aimed to extract a non-starch polysaccharide from purple sweet potato and analyze its structure and ability to regulate the intestinal flora of mice with AAD. The diarrhea model was established via intragastric administration of lincomycin and different concentrations of PSPPs (0.1 g kg-1, 0.2 g kg-1, and 0.4 g kg-1) to Balb/C mice. The results showed that PSPP was a pyran polysaccharide with 1 → 2, 1 → 2, 6, 1 → 4, 1 → 4, 6 glycosidic bonds in an α-configuration. In vivo experiments showed that PSPP could relieve diarrhea and improve the structural damage in the ileum caused by lincomycin hydrochloride. In addition, treatment with PSPPs decreased the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α but increased the level of IL-10 in the intestines of mice (p &lt; 0.01). The results of 16S rRNA sequencing showed that PSPPs changed the composition and diversity of the intestinal flora of mice with AAD. In addition, PSPP treatment increased the content of short-chain fatty acids (p &lt; 0.01). These results revealed that PSPPs regulated the intestinal flora, balanced fatty acid metabolism, and relieved the symptoms of diarrhea to a certain extent in mice.

## Targeted 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing of leaf and spike tissues of Piper longum identifies new candidates for bioprospecting of bioactive compounds.
 20.05.2021, _S Mishra, D Goyal, L Phurailatpam_


Piper longum (also known as Indian long pepper) is widely used in Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani medicine systems. The principle bioactive compound of this plant is piperine, which mainly accumulates in the fruits called spikes. The report of piperine production by endophytic microbes isolated from Piper sp., motivated us to investigate the endophytic microbial diversity associated with the spikes vis-à-vis leaves (which contain negligible levels of piperine). This is the first report to use metagenomics approach to unravel the endophytic microbial diversity in P. longum. Our results indicate that 2, 56, 631 bacterial OTUs and 1090 fungal OTUs were picked cumulatively from both the tissues. Although bacterial and fungal endophytes occupy the same niche, remarkable differences exist in their diversity and abundance. For instance, the most abundant bacterial genera in spikes were Nocardioides and Pseudonocardia (Phylum Actinobacteria; reported to produce bioactive compounds); while, in leaves were Larkinella and Hymenobacter (Phylum Bacteriodetes). Likewise, the fungal endophytes, Periconia, Cladosporium and Coniothyrium (which have been earlier reported to produce commercially important metabolites including piperine), were also present in high abundance in spikes, in comparison to leaves. Further, the results of PICRUSt analysis reveal the high metabolic potential of spike-associated bacteria for secondary metabolism, namely biosynthesis of alkaloids (including pyridine/piperidine), terpenes, flavonoids and antibiotics. Therefore, our findings indicate that the endophytes abundant or unique in spikes could be explored for bioprospecting of novel/commercially important metabolites; an approach that has both ecological and economical benefits.

## Absence of Nanoparticle-Induced Drought Tolerance in Nutrient Sufficient Wheat Seedlings.
 19.05.2021, _M Potter, J Deakin, A Cartwright, J Hortin, D Sparks, AJ Anderson, JE McLean, A Jacobson, DW Britt_


Strategies to reduce crop losses due to drought are needed as climate variability affects agricultural productivity. Wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Juniper) growth in a nutrient-sufficient, solid growth matrix containing varied doses of CuO, ZnO, and SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) was used to evaluate NP mitigation of drought stress. NP amendments were at fertilizer levels, with maxima of 30 Cu, 20 Zn, and 200 Si (mg metal/kg matrix). Seeds of this drought-tolerant cultivar were inoculated with Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6 (PcO6) to provide a protective root microbiome. An 8 day drought imposed on 14 day-old wheat seedlings decreased shoot and root mass, shoot water content, and the quantum yield of photosystem II when compared to watered plants. PcO6 root colonization was not impaired by drought or NPs. A dose-dependent increase in the Cu, Zn, and Si from the NPs was observed from analysis of the rhizosphere solution, and this process was not affected by drought. Consequently, fertilizer concentrations of the NPs did not further improve drought tolerance in wheat seedlings under the growth conditions of adequate mineral nutrition and the presence of a beneficial microbiome. These findings suggest that potential NP benefits in promoting plant drought tolerance occur only under certain environmental conditions.

## Diverse Viruses Carrying Genes for Microbial Extremotolerance in the Atacama Desert Hyperarid Soil.
 19.05.2021, _Y Hwang, J Rahlff, D Schulze-Makuch, M Schloter, AJ Probst_


Viruses play an essential role in shaping microbial community structures and serve as reservoirs for genetic diversity in many ecosystems. In hyperarid desert environments, where life itself becomes scarce and loses diversity, the interactions between viruses and host populations have remained elusive. Here, we resolved host-virus interactions in the soil metagenomes of the Atacama Desert hyperarid core, one of the harshest terrestrial environments on Earth. We show evidence of diverse viruses infecting a wide range of hosts found in sites up to 205 km apart. Viral genomes carried putative extremotolerance features (i.e., spore formation proteins) and auxiliary metabolic genes, indicating that viruses could mediate the spread of microbial resilience against environmental stress across the desert. We propose a mutualistic model of host-virus interactions in the hyperarid core where viruses seek protection in microbial cells as lysogens or pseudolysogens, while viral extremotolerance genes aid survival of their hosts. Our results suggest that the host-virus interactions in the Atacama Desert soils are dynamic and complex, shaping uniquely adapted microbiomes in this highly selective and hostile environment.IMPORTANCE Deserts are one of the largest and rapidly expanding terrestrial ecosystems characterized by low biodiversity and biomass. The hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert, previously thought to be devoid of life, is one of the harshest environments, supporting only scant biomass of highly adapted microbes. While there is growing evidence that viruses play essential roles in shaping the diversity and structure of nearly every ecosystem, very little is known about the role of viruses in desert soils, especially where viral contact with viable hosts is significantly reduced. Our results demonstrate that diverse viruses are widely dispersed across the desert, potentially spreading key stress resilience and metabolic genes to ensure host survival. The desertification accelerated by climate change expands both the ecosystem cover and the ecological significance of the desert virome. This study sheds light on the complex virus-host interplay that shapes the unique microbiome in desert soils.

## Identifying biases and their potential solutions in human microbiome studies.
 22.05.2021, _JT Nearing, AM Comeau, MGI Langille_


Advances in DNA sequencing technology have vastly improved the ability of researchers to explore the microbial inhabitants of the human body. Unfortunately, while these studies have uncovered the importance of these microbial communities to our health, they often do not result in similar findings. One possible reason for the disagreement in these results is due to the multitude of systemic biases that are introduced during sequence-based microbiome studies. These biases begin with sample collection and continue to be introduced throughout the entire experiment leading to an observed community that is significantly altered from the true underlying microbial composition. In this review, we will highlight the various steps in typical sequence-based human microbiome studies where significant bias can be introduced, and we will review the current efforts within the field that aim to reduce the impact of these biases.

## Application of Machine Learning in Translational Medicine: Current Status and Future Opportunities.
 22.05.2021, _N Terranova, K Venkatakrishnan, LJ Benincosa_


The exponential increase in our ability to harness multi-dimensional biological and clinical data from experimental to real-world settings has transformed pharmaceutical research and development in recent years, with increasing applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Patient-centered iterative forward and reverse translation is at the heart of precision medicine discovery and development across the continuum from target validation to optimization of pharmacotherapy. Integration of advanced analytics into the practice of Translational Medicine is now a fundamental enabler to fully exploit information contained in diverse sources of big data sets such as "omics" data, as illustrated by deep characterizations of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome, and exposome. In this commentary, we provide an overview of ML applications in drug discovery and development, aligned with the three strategic pillars of Translational Medicine (target, patient, dose) and offer perspectives on their potential to transform the science and practice of the discipline. Opportunities for integrating ML approaches into the discipline of Pharmacometrics are discussed and will revolutionize the practice of model-informed drug discovery and development. Finally, we posit that joint efforts of Clinical Pharmacology, Bioinformatics, and Biomarker Technology experts are vital in cross-functional team settings to realize the promise of AI/ML-enabled Translational and Precision Medicine.

## An inter-laboratory study to investigate the impact of the bioinformatics component on microbiome analysis using mock communities.

Despite the advent of whole genome metagenomics, targeted approaches (such as 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) continue to be valuable for determining the microbial composition of samples. Amplicon microbiome sequencing can be performed on clinical samples from a normally sterile site to determine the aetiology of an infection (usually single pathogen identification) or samples from more complex niches such as human mucosa or environmental samples where multiple microorganisms need to be identified. The methodologies are frequently applied to determine both presence of micro-organisms and their quantity or relative abundance. There are a number of technical steps required to perform microbial community profiling, many of which may have appreciable precision and bias that impacts final results. In order for these methods to be applied with the greatest accuracy, comparative studies across different laboratories are warranted. In this study we explored the impact of the bioinformatic approaches taken in different laboratories on microbiome assessment using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing results. Data were generated from two mock microbial community samples which were amplified using primer sets spanning five different variable regions of 16S rRNA genes. The PCR-sequencing analysis included three technical repeats of the process to determine the repeatability of their methods. Thirteen laboratories participated in the study, and each analysed the same FASTQ files using their choice of pipeline. This study captured the methods used and the resulting sequence annotation and relative abundance output from bioinformatic analyses. Results were compared to digital PCR assessment of the absolute abundance of each target representing each organism in the mock microbial community samples and also to analyses of shotgun metagenome sequence data. This ring trial demonstrates that the choice of bioinformatic analysis pipeline alone can result in different estimations of the composition of the microbiome when using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data. The study observed differences in terms of both presence and abundance of organisms and provides a resource for ensuring reproducible pipeline development and application. The observed differences were especially prevalent when using custom databases and applying high stringency operational taxonomic unit (OTU) cut-off limits. In order to apply sequencing approaches with greater accuracy, the impact of different analytical steps needs to be clearly delineated and solutions devised to harmonise microbiome analysis results.

## A semiparametric model for between-subject attributes: Applications to beta-diversity of microbiome data.
 19.05.2021, _J Liu, X Zhang, T Chen, T Wu, T Lin, L Jiang, S Lang, L Liu, L Natarajan, JX Tu, T Kosciolek, J Morton, TT Nguyen, B Schnabl, R Knight, C Feng, Y Zhong, XM Tu_


The human microbiome plays an important role in our health and identifying factors associated with microbiome composition provides insights into inherent disease mechanisms. By amplifying and sequencing the marker genes in high-throughput sequencing, with highly similar sequences binned together, we obtain Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) profiles for each subject. Due to the high-dimensionality and non-normality features of the OTUs, the measure of diversity is introduced as a summarization at the microbial community level, including the distance-based Beta-diversity between individuals. Analyses of such between-subject attributes are not amenable to the predominant within-subject based statistical paradigm, such as t-tests and linear regression. In this paper, we propose a new approach to model Beta-diversity as a response within a regression setting by utilizing the functional response models (FRM), a class of semiparametric models for between- as well as within-subject attributes. The new approach not only addresses limitations of current methods for Beta-diversity with cross-sectional data, but also provides a premise for extending the approach to longitudinal and other clustered data in the future. The proposed approach is illustrated with both real and simulated data. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
