 24.04.2024, _A Bani Saeid, G De Rubis, KA Williams, S Yeung, DK Chellappan, SK Singh, G Gupta, PM Hansbro, MA Shahbazi, M Gulati, IP Kaur, HA Santos, KR Paudel, K Dua_


The escalating prevalence of lung diseases underscores the need for innovative therapies. Dysbiosis in human body microbiome has emerged as a significant factor in these diseases, indicating a potential role for synbiotics in restoring microbial equilibrium. However, effective delivery of synbiotics to the target site remains challenging. Here, we aim to explore suitable nanoparticles for encapsulating synbiotics tailored for applications in lung diseases. Nanoencapsulation has emerged as a prominent strategy to address the delivery challenges of synbiotics in this context. Through a comprehensive review, we assess the potential of nanoparticles in facilitating synbiotic delivery and their structural adaptability for this purpose. Our review reveals that nanoparticles such as nanocellulose, starch, and chitosan exhibit high potential for synbiotic encapsulation. These offer flexibility in structure design and synthesis, making them promising candidates for addressing delivery challenges in lung diseases. Furthermore, our analysis highlights that synbiotics, when compared to probiotics alone, demonstrate superior anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial and anticancer activities. This review underscores the promising role of nanoparticle-encapsulated synbiotics as a targeted and effective therapeutic approach for lung diseases, contributing valuable insights into the potential of nanomedicine in revolutionizing treatment strategies for respiratory conditions, ultimately paving the way for future advancements in this field.

_Female, Humans, Animals, Cattle, Farmers, Livestock, Farms, Agriculture, Microbiota_
Globally, half a billion people are employed in animal agriculture and are directly exposed to the associated microorganisms. However, the extent to which such exposures affect resident human microbiomes is unclear. Here we conducted a longitudinal profiling of the nasal and faecal microbiomes of 66 dairy farmers and 166 dairy cows over a year-long period. We compare farmer microbiomes to those of 60 age-, sex- and ZIP code-matched people with no occupational exposures to farm animals (non-farmers). We show that farming is associated with microbiomes containing livestock-associated microbes; this is most apparent in the nasal bacterial community, with farmers harbouring a richer and more diverse nasal community than non-farmers. Similarly, in the gut microbial communities, we identify more shared microbial lineages between cows and farmers from the same farms. Additionally, we find that shared microbes are associated with antibiotic resistance genes. Overall, our study demonstrates the interconnectedness of human and animal microbiomes.

## Multi-strain probiotics ameliorate Alzheimer's-like cognitive impairment and pathological changes through the AKT/GSK-3β pathway in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 mice.
 30.03.2024, _Q Xiao-Hang, C Si-Yue, T Hui-Dong_


Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent type of dementia, still lacks disease-modifying treatment strategies. Recent evidence indicates that maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis plays a crucial role in AD. Targeted regulation of gut microbiota, including probiotics, is anticipated to emerge as a potential approach for AD treatment. However, the efficacy and mechanism of multi-strain probiotics treatment in AD remain unclear.

Despite an increasingly detailed picture of the molecular mechanisms of phage-bacterial interactions, we lack an understanding of how these interactions evolve and impact disease within patients. Here we report a year-long, nation-wide study of diarrheal disease patients in Bangladesh. Among cholera patients, we quantified Vibrio cholerae (prey) and its virulent phages (predators) using metagenomics and quantitative PCR, while accounting for antibiotic exposure using quantitative mass spectrometry. Virulent phage (ICP1) and antibiotics suppressed V. cholerae to varying degrees and were inversely associated with severe dehydration depending on resistance mechanisms. In the absence of anti-phage defenses, predation was 'effective,' with a high predator:prey ratio that correlated with increased genetic diversity among the prey. In the presence of anti-phage defenses, predation was 'ineffective,' with a lower predator:prey ratio that correlated with increased genetic diversity among the predators. Phage-bacteria coevolution within patients should therefore be considered in the deployment of phage-based therapies and diagnostics.

## Single-cell RNA-seq of the rare virosphere reveals the native hosts of giant viruses in the marine environment.
 22.04.2024, _A Fromm, G Hevroni, F Vincent, D Schatz, CA Martinez-Gutierrez, FO Aylward, A Vardi_


Giant viruses (phylum Nucleocytoviricota) are globally distributed in aquatic ecosystems. They play fundamental roles as evolutionary drivers of eukaryotic plankton and regulators of global biogeochemical cycles. However, we lack knowledge about their native hosts, hindering our understanding of their life cycle and ecological importance. In the present study, we applied a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach to samples collected during an induced algal bloom, which enabled pairing active giant viruses with their native protist hosts. We detected hundreds of single cells from multiple host lineages infected by diverse giant viruses. These host cells included members of the algal groups Chrysophycae and Prymnesiophycae, as well as heterotrophic flagellates in the class Katablepharidaceae. Katablepharids were infected with a rare Imitervirales-07 giant virus lineage expressing a large repertoire of cell-fate regulation genes. Analysis of the temporal dynamics of these host-virus interactions revealed an important role for the Imitervirales-07 in controlling the population size of the host Katablepharid population. Our results demonstrate that scRNA-seq can be used to identify previously undescribed host-virus interactions and study their ecological importance and impact.

Preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy-specific syndrome, has been associated with the gut bacteriome. Here, to investigate the impact of the gut virome on the development of PE, we identified over 8,000 nonredundant viruses from the fecal metagenomes of 40 early-onset PE and 37 healthy pregnant women and profiled their abundances. Comparison and correlation analysis showed that PE-enriched viruses frequently connected to Blautia species enriched in PE. By contrast, bacteria linked to PE-depleted viruses were often the Bacteroidaceae members such as Bacteroides spp., Phocaeicola spp., Parabacteroides spp., and Alistipes shahii. In terms of viral function, PE-depleted viruses had auxiliary metabolic genes that participated in the metabolism of simple and complex polysaccharides, sulfur metabolism, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, while PE-enriched viruses had a gene encoding cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate synthase, which seemed to be special, that participates in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor. Furthermore, the classification model based on gut viral signatures was developed to discriminate PE patients from healthy controls and showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.922 that was better than that of the bacterium-based model. This study opens up new avenues for further research, providing valuable insights into the PE gut virome and offering potential directions for future mechanistic and therapeutic investigations, with the ultimate goal of improving the diagnosis and management of PE.IMPORTANCEThe importance of this study lies in its exploration of the previously overlooked but potentially critical role of the gut virome in preeclampsia (PE). While the association between PE and the gut bacteriome has been recognized, this research takes a pioneering step into understanding how the gut virome, represented by over 8,000 nonredundant viruses, contributes to this condition. The findings reveal intriguing connections between PE-enriched viruses and specific gut bacteria, such as the prevalence of Blautia species in individuals with PE, contrasting with bacteria linked to PE-depleted viruses, including members of the Bacteroidaceae family. These viral interactions and associations provide a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics at play in PE.

## A metagenomics pipeline reveals insertion sequence-driven evolution of the microbiota.
 15.04.2024, _JM Kirsch, AJ Hryckowian, BA Duerkop_


Insertion sequence (IS) elements are mobile genetic elements in bacterial genomes that support adaptation. We developed a database of IS elements coupled to a computational pipeline that identifies IS element insertions in the microbiota. We discovered that diverse IS elements insert into the genomes of intestinal bacteria regardless of human host lifestyle. These insertions target bacterial accessory genes that aid in their adaptation to unique environmental conditions. Using IS expansion in Bacteroides, we show that IS activity leads to the insertion of "hot spots" in accessory genes. We show that IS insertions are stable and can be transferred between humans. Extreme environmental perturbations force IS elements to fall out of the microbiota, and many fail to rebound following homeostasis. Our work shows that IS elements drive bacterial genome diversification within the microbiota and establishes a framework for understanding how strain-level variation within the microbiota impacts human health.

_Benchmarking, Metagenome, Ecosystem, Metagenomics, Computational Biology, Databases, Genetic, Viruses_
As most viruses remain uncultivated, metagenomics is currently the main method for virus discovery. Detecting viruses in metagenomic data is not trivial. In the past few years, many bioinformatic virus identification tools have been developed for this task, making it challenging to choose the right tools, parameters, and cutoffs. As all these tools measure different biological signals, and use different algorithms and training and reference databases, it is imperative to conduct an independent benchmarking to give users objective guidance.

Unraveling bacterial gene function drives progress in various areas, such as food production, pharmacology, and ecology. While omics technologies capture high-dimensional phenotypic data, linking them to genomic data is challenging, leaving 40-60% of bacterial genes undescribed. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Scoary2, an ultra-fast microbial genome-wide association studies (mGWAS) software. With its data exploration app and improved performance, Scoary2 is the first tool to enable the study of large phenotypic datasets using mGWAS. As proof of concept, we explore the metabolome of yogurts, each produced with a different Propionibacterium reichii strain and discover two genes affecting carnitine metabolism.

_Metagenome, Microbiota, Algorithms, Bacteria, Metagenomics_
In the metagenomic assembly of a microbial community, abundant species are often thought to assemble well given their deeper sequencing coverage. This conjuncture is rarely tested or evaluated in practice. We often do not know how many abundant species are missing and do not have an approach to recover them.

## Refining the impact of genetic evidence on clinical success.
 17.04.2024, _EV Minikel, JL Painter, CC Dong, MR Nelson_


The cost of drug discovery and development is driven primarily by failure1, with only about 10% of clinical programmes eventually receiving approval2-4. We previously estimated that human genetic evidence doubles the success rate from clinical development to approval5. In this study we leverage the growth in genetic evidence over the past decade to better understand the characteristics that distinguish clinical success and failure. We estimate the probability of success for drug mechanisms with genetic support is 2.6 times greater than those without. This relative success varies among therapy areas and development phases, and improves with increasing confidence in the causal gene, but is largely unaffected by genetic effect size, minor allele frequency or year of discovery. These results indicate we are far from reaching peak genetic insights to aid the discovery of targets for more effective drugs.
