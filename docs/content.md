## Iron homeostasis in host and gut bacteria - a complex interrelationship.
 05.02.2021, _Y Seyoum, K Baye, C Humblot_


Iron deficiency is the most frequent nutritional deficiency in the world with an estimated 1.4 billion people affected. The usual way to fight iron deficiency is iron fortification, but this approach is not always effective and can have undesirable side effects including an increase in the growth and virulence of gut bacterial pathogens responsible for diarrhea and gut inflammation. Iron is mainly absorbed in the duodenum and is tightly regulated in mammals. Unabsorbed iron enters the colonic lumen where many microorganisms, referred to as gut microbiota, reside. Iron is essential for these bacteria, and its availability consequently affects this microbial ecosystem. The aim of this review is to provide further insights into the complex relationship between iron and gut microbiota. Given that overcoming anemia caused by iron deficiency is still a challenge today, gut microbiota could help identify more efficient ways to tackle this public health problem.

## α1-3Gal antigen in gut microbiota, a potential new environmental factor in multiple sclerosis.
 08.02.2021, _L Boussamet, E Montassier, JP Soulillou, L Berthelot_


Gut microbiota from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients present qualitative and quantitative differences of bacteria abundance compared to healthy subjects. In an another hand, gut microbiota may drive some specific types of antibody responses in human and may represent a new environmental factor in MS etiology. However, whether and to which extent the amount of a given microbiota antigen is associated with the level of the antibody response against the corresponding antigen is yet unknown. The level of anti-α1-3Gal (Gal) antibodies are decreased in MS. Recently, we have proposed a first map of gut bacteria displaying α1-3-Galactosyltransferase gene sequences. This review summarizes the current knowledge on antibody response to the Gal epitope associated to changes of gut microbiota profile in MS as well as on the possible mechanisms by which the altered microbiota and/or circulating anti-Gal level could affect the immune response in this disease.

## Alterations in the gut bacterial microbiome in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy.
 06.02.2021, _T Das, R Jayasudha, S Chakravarthy, GS Prashanthi, A Bhargava, M Tyagi, PK Rani, RR Pappuru, S Sharma, S Shivaji_


Gut bacterial microbiome dysbiosis in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) has been reported, but such an association with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is not known. We explored possible link between gut bacterial microbiome dysbiosis and DR. Using fecal samples of healthy controls (HC) and people with T2DM with/without DR, gut bacterial communities were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and data analysed using QIIME and R software. Dysbiosis in the gut microbiomes, at phyla and genera level, was observed in people with T2DM and DR compared to HC. People with DR exhibited greater discrimination from HC. Microbiomes of people with T2DM and DR were also significantly different. Both DM and DR microbiomes showed a decrease in anti-inflammatory, probiotic and other bacteria that could be pathogenic, compared to HC, and the observed change was more pronounced in people with DR. This is the first report demonstrating dysbiosis in the gut microbiome (alteration in the diversity and abundance at the phyla and genera level) in people with DR compared to HC. Such studies would help in developing novel and targeted therapies to improve treatment of DR.

## Understanding structure/function relationships in nitrifying microbial communities after cross-transfer between freshwater and seawater.
 07.02.2021, _BM Gonzalez-Silva, KR Jonassen, I Bakke, K Østgaard, O Vadstein_


In this study, nitrification before and after abrupt cross-transfer in salinity was investigated in two moving bed biofilm reactors inoculated with nitrifying cultures that had adaptation to freshwater (FR) and seawater salinities (SR). FR and SR MBRRs were exposed to short and long term cross-transfer in salinity, and the functional capacity of nitrifying microbial communities was quantified by the estimation of ammonia and nitrite oxidation rates. Salinity induced successions were evaluated before and after salinity change by deep sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and statistical analysis. The bacterial community structure was characterized and Venn diagrams were included. The results indicated that after salinity cross-transfer, the FR was not significantly recovered at seawater salinity whereas SR showed high resistance to stress caused by low-salt. Succession and physiological plasticity were the main mechanisms of the long-term adaption of the nitrifying communities exposed to abrupt salinity changes. Independently of salinity, some nitrifiers presented high physiological plasticity towards salinity and were very successful at both zero and full seawater salinity. SR culture is robust and suitable inoculum for ammonium removal from recirculating aquaculture systems and industrial wastewaters with variable and fast salinity changes. Our findings contradict the current perspective of the significance of salinity on the structure of nitrifying communities.

## The microbial dimension of submarine groundwater discharge: current challenges and future directions.
 04.02.2021, _C Ruiz-González, V Rodellas, J Garcia-Orellana_


Despite the relevance of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) for ocean biogeochemistry, the microbial dimension of SGD remains poorly understood. SGD can influence marine microbial communities through supplying chemical compounds and microorganisms, and in turn, microbes at the land-ocean transition zone determine the chemistry of the groundwater reaching the ocean. However, compared to inland groundwater, little is known about microbial communities in coastal aquifers. Here we review the state-of-the-art of the microbial dimension of SGD, with emphasis on prokaryotes, and identify current challenges and future directions. Main challenges include improving the diversity description of groundwater microbiota, characterized by ultra-small, inactive and novel taxa, and by high ratios of sediment-attached versus free-living cells. Studies should explore microbial dynamics and their role in chemical cycles in coastal aquifers, the bidirectional dispersal of groundwater and seawater microorganisms, and marine bacterioplankton responses to SGD. This will require combining sequencing methods, visualization, and linking taxonomy to activity, but also considering the entire groundwater-marine continuum. Interactions between traditionally independent disciplines (e.g., hydrogeology, microbial ecology) are needed to frame the study of terrestrial and aquatic microorganisms beyond the limits of their presumed habitats, and to foster our understanding of SGD processes and their influence in coastal biogeochemical cycles.

## Estrogen induces shift in abundances of specific groups of the coral microbiome.
 06.02.2021, _CLS Vilela, HDM Villela, GAS Duarte, EP Santoro, CTCC Rachid, RS Peixoto_


Synthetic estrogens such as ethinylestradiol (EE2) are persistent micropollutants that are not effectively removed from wastewater by conventional treatments. These contaminants are released into waterbodies, where they disrupt endocrine systems of organisms and cause harmful effects such as feminization, infertility, reproduction problems and genital malformations. The consequences of this pollution for key marine ecosystems such as coral reefs and their associated microbiomes are underexplored. We evaluated the effects of EE2 concentrations of 100 ng L-1 and 100 µg L-1 on the coral metaorganism Mussismilia harttii. The results indicated no effects on visible bleaching or Fv/Fm ratios in the corals during a 17-day microcosm experiment. However, next-generation sequencing of 16S rDNA revealed a statistically significant effect of high EE2 concentrations on OTU richness, and shifts in specific microbial groups after treatments with or without EE2. These groups might be bioindicators of early shifts in the metaorganism composition caused by EE2 contamination.

## Development of a robust protocol for the characterization of the pulmonary microbiota.
 08.02.2021, _N Dumont-Leblond, M Veillette, C Racine, P Joubert, C Duchaine_


The lack of methodological standardization diminishes the validity of results obtained and the conclusions drawn when studying the lung microbiota. We report the validation of a complete 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing workflow, from patient recruitment to bioinformatics, tailored to the constrains of the pulmonary environment. We minimize the impact of contaminants and establish negative controls to track and account for them at every step. Enzymatic and mechanical homogenization combined to commercially available extraction kits allow for a fast and reliable extraction of bacterial DNA. The DNA extraction kits have a significant impact on the bacterial composition of the controls. The bacterial signatures of extracted cancerous and healthy human tissues from 5 patients are highly distinguishable from methodological controls. Our work expands our understanding of low microbial burdened environments analysis. This article is to be a starting point towards methodological standardization and the implementation of proper sampling procedures in the study of lung microbiota.
