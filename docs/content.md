The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO  2  levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is Enterobacter bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections.

When we humans travel, our microorganisms come along. These can be harmless but also pathogenic, and are spread by touching surfaces or breathing aerosols in the passenger cabins. As the pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 has shown, those environments display a risk for infection transmission. For a risk reduction, countermeasures such as wearing face masks and distancing were applied in many places, yet had a significant social impact. Nevertheless, the next pandemic will come and additional countermeasures that contribute to the risk reduction are needed to keep commuters safe and reduce the spread of microorganisms and pathogens, but also have as little impact as possible on the daily lives of commuters. This review describes the bacterial microbiome of subways around the world, which is mainly characterized by human-associated genera. We emphasize on healthcare-associated ESKAPE pathogens within public transport, introduce state-of-the art methods to detect common microbes and potential pathogens such as LAMP and next-generation sequencing. Further, we describe and discuss possible countermeasures that could be deployed in public transportation systems, as antimicrobial surfaces or air sterilization using plasma. Commuting in public transport can harbor risks of infection. Improving the safety of travelers can be achieved by effective detection methods, microbial reduction systems, but importantly by hand hygiene and common-sense hygiene guidelines.

Microbiota are closely associated with human health and disease. Metaproteomics can provide a direct means to identify microbial proteins in microbiota for compositional and functional characterization. However, in-depth and accurate metaproteomics is still limited due to the extreme complexity and high diversity of microbiota samples. It is generally recommended to use metagenomic data from the same samples to construct the protein sequence database for metaproteomic data analysis. Although different metagenomics-based database construction strategies have been developed, an optimization of gene taxonomic annotation has not been reported, which, however, is extremely important for accurate metaproteomic analysis.

## Amplidiff: an optimized amplicon sequencing approach to estimating lineage abundances in viral metagenomes.
 26.03.2024, _JV Bemmelen, DS Smyth, JA Baaijens_


_Metagenome, Microbiota, DNA Primers, Algorithms, Sequence Analysis, DNA, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S_
Metagenomic profiling algorithms commonly rely on genomic differences between lineages, strains, or species to infer the relative abundances of sequences present in a sample. This observation plays an important role in the analysis of diverse microbial communities, where targeted sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA, both well-known hypervariable genomic regions, have led to insights into microbial diversity and the discovery of novel organisms. However, the variable nature of discriminatory regions can also act as a double-edged sword, as the sought-after variability can make it difficult to design primers for their amplification through PCR. Moreover, the most variable regions are not necessarily the most informative regions for the purpose of differentiation; one should focus on regions that maximize the number of lineages that can be distinguished.

## Multi-omic integration of microbiome data for identifying disease-associated modules.
 26.03.2024, _E Muller, I Shiryan, E Borenstein_


_Humans, Multiomics, Microbiota, Bacteria, Gastrointestinal Microbiome_
Multi-omic studies of the human gut microbiome are crucial for understanding its role in disease across multiple functional layers. Nevertheless, integrating and analyzing such complex datasets poses significant challenges. Most notably, current analysis methods often yield extensive lists of disease-associated features (e.g., species, pathways, or metabolites), without capturing the multi-layered structure of the data. Here, we address this challenge by introducing "MintTea", an intermediate integration-based approach combining canonical correlation analysis extensions, consensus analysis, and an evaluation protocol. MintTea identifies "disease-associated multi-omic modules", comprising features from multiple omics that shift in concord and that collectively associate with the disease. Applied to diverse cohorts, MintTea captures modules with high predictive power, significant cross-omic correlations, and alignment with known microbiome-disease associations. For example, analyzing samples from a metabolic syndrome study, MintTea identifies a module with serum glutamate- and TCA cycle-related metabolites, along with bacterial species linked to insulin resistance. In another dataset, MintTea identifies a module associated with late-stage colorectal cancer, including Peptostreptococcus and Gemella species and fecal amino acids, in line with these species' metabolic activity and their coordinated gradual increase with cancer development. This work demonstrates the potential of advanced integration methods in generating systems-level, multifaceted hypotheses underlying microbiome-disease interactions.

## Gender affirming hormone therapy preserves skeletal maturation in young mice via the gut microbiome.
 26.03.2024, _S Pal, X Morgan, HY Dar, CA Gacasan, S Patil, A Stoica, YJ Hu, MN Weitzmann, RM Jones, R Pacifici_


Gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is often prescribed to transgender (TG) adolescents to alleviate gender dysphoria, but the impact of GAHT on the growing skeleton is unclear. We found GAHT to improve trabecular bone structure via increased bone formation in young male mice and not to affect trabecular structure in female mice. GAHT modified gut microbiome composition in both male and female mice. However, fecal microbiota transfers (FMT) revealed that GAHT-shaped gut microbiome was a communicable regulator of bone structure and turnover in male, but not in female mice. Mediation analysis identified two species of Bacteroides as significant contributors to the skeletal effects of GAHT in male mice, with Bacteroides supplementation phenocopying the effects of GAHT on bone. Bacteroides have the capacity to expand Treg populations in the gut. Accordingly, GAHT expanded intestinal regulatory T cells (Tregs) and stimulated their homing to the bone marrow (BM) in male but not in female mice. Attesting to the functional relevance of Tregs, pharmacological blockade of Treg expansion prevented GAHT-induced bone anabolism. In summary, in male mice GAHT stimulated bone formation and improved trabecular structure by promoting Treg expansion via a microbiome-mediated effect. In female mice GAHT neither improved nor impaired trabecular structure.

The host-microbiota interaction plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and disease susceptibility, and microbial tryptophan metabolites are potent modulators of host physiology. However, whether and how these metabolites mediate host-microbiota interactions, particularly in terms of inter-microbial communication, remains unclear.

## Microbiota from human infants consuming secretors or non-secretors mothers' milk impacts the gut and immune system in mice.
 26.03.2024, _M Gurung, BT Schlegel, D Rajasundaram, R Fox, L Bode, T Yao, SR Lindemann, T LeRoith, QD Read, C Simecka, L Carroll, A Andres, L Yeruva_


Maternal secretor status is one of the determinants of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) composition, which, in turn, influences the gut microbiota composition of infants. To understand if this change in gut microbiota impacts immune cell composition, intestinal morphology, and gene expression, 21-day-old germ-free C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with fecal microbiota from infants whose mothers were either secretors (SMM) or non-secretors (NSM) or from infants consuming dairy-based formula (MFM). For each group, one set of mice was supplemented with HMOs. HMO supplementation did not significantly impact the microbiota diversity; however, SMM mice had a higher abundance of genus Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Blautia, whereas, in the NSM group, there was a higher abundance of Akkermansia, Enterocloster, and Klebsiella. In MFM, gut microbiota was represented mainly by Parabacteroides, Ruminococcaceae_unclassified, and Clostrodium_sensu_stricto. In mesenteric lymph node, Foxp3+ T cells and innate lymphoid cells type 2 were increased in MFM mice supplemented with HMOs, while in the spleen, they were increased in SMM + HMOs mice. Similarly, serum immunoglobulin A was also elevated in MFM + HMOs group. Distinct global gene expression of the gut was observed in each microbiota group, which was enhanced with HMOs supplementation. Overall, our data show that distinct infant gut microbiota due to maternal secretor status or consumption of dairy-based formula and HMO supplementation impacts immune cell composition, antibody response, and intestinal gene expression in a mouse model.

## Lose-lose consequences of bacterial community-driven invasions in soil.
 20.03.2024, _X Liu, JF Salles_


_Soil, Soil Microbiology, Bacteria, Microbiota_
Community-driven invasion, also known as community coalescence, occurs widely in natural ecosystems. Despite that, our knowledge about the process and mechanisms controlling community-driven invasion in soil ecosystems is lacking. Here, we performed a set of coalescence experiments in soil microcosms and assessed impacts up to 60 days after coalescence by quantifying multiple traits (compositional, functional, and metabolic) of the invasive and coalescent communities.

## Manipulating the physical distance between cells during soil colonization reveals the importance of biotic interactions in microbial community assembly.
 22.03.2024, _S Romdhane, S Huet, A Spor, D Bru, MC Breuil, L Philippot_


Microbial communities are of tremendous importance for ecosystem functioning and yet we know little about the ecological processes driving the assembly of these communities in the environment. Here, we used an unprecedented experimental approach based on the manipulation of physical distance between neighboring cells during soil colonization to determine the role of bacterial interactions in soil community assembly. We hypothesized that experimentally manipulating the physical distance between bacterial cells will modify the interaction strengths leading to differences in microbial community composition, with increasing distance between neighbors favoring poor competitors.

To determine whether different aspects lead to a heterogeneous distribution of soil fungi, we investigated artificially established alpine grasslands in the Muli mining area in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Employing high-throughput sequencing techniques, we analyzed the composition, diversity, and function of soil fungal communities across various aspects (flat, East-facing, South-facing, West-facing, North-facing). We also examined their relationships with environmental factors. Soil fungal communities of restored alpine grasslands differed significantly across aspects in terms of the dominant phyla, classes and species level. Compared with No aspect, the Shannon index of fungi respectively decreased by 2.99%, 19.32%, 19.37% and 10.56% for East aspect, South aspect, West aspect and North aspect, respectively, and the Chao1 index of fungi respectively decreased by-2.44%, 35.50%, 42.15% and 3.21%, respectively. A total of 22 different types of fungi were identified in the study area. Predictive analysis, based on PICRUSt2, indicated that the primary functions of the fungal communities across different aspects were aerobic respiration I (cytochrome c) and aerobic respiration II (cytochrome c). Among the environmental variables, total phosphorus (P) and total nitrogen (N) were the principal factors influencing the fungal community composition.In conclusion, aspect plays a significant role in shaping the composition of fungal communities and also affects their overall diversity.

## Exploring the potential effects of forest urbanization on the interplay between small mammal communities and their gut microbiota.
 28.03.2024, _M Bouilloud, M Galan, J Pradel, A Loiseau, J Ferrero, R Gallet, B Roche, N Charbonnel_


Urbanization significantly impacts wild populations, favoring urban dweller species over those that are unable to adapt to rapid changes. These differential adaptative abilities could be mediated by the microbiome, which may modulate the host phenotype rapidly through a high degree of flexibility. Conversely, under anthropic perturbations, the microbiota of some species could be disrupted, resulting in dysbiosis and negative impacts on host fitness. The links between the impact of urbanization on host communities and their gut microbiota (GM) have only been scarcely explored. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the bacterial composition of the GM could play a role in host adaptation to urban environments. We described the GM of several species of small terrestrial mammals sampled in forested areas along a gradient of urbanization, using a 16S metabarcoding approach. We tested whether urbanization led to changes in small mammal communities and in their GM, considering the presence and abundance of bacterial taxa and their putative functions. This enabled to decipher the processes underlying these changes. We found potential impacts of urbanization on small mammal communities and their GM. The urban dweller species had a lower bacterial taxonomic diversity but a higher functional diversity and a different composition compared to urban adapter species. Their GM assembly was mostly governed by stochastic effects, potentially indicating dysbiosis. Selection processes and an overabundance of functions were detected that could be associated with adaptation to urban environments despite dysbiosis. In urban adapter species, the GM functional diversity and composition remained relatively stable along the urbanization gradient. This observation can be explained by functional redundancy, where certain taxa express the same function. This could favor the adaptation of urban adapter species in various environments, including urban settings. We can therefore assume that there are feedbacks between the gut microbiota and host species within communities, enabling rapid adaptation.

Reproducibility is a fundamental principle in science, ensuring reliable and valid findings. However, replication studies are scarce, particularly in ecology, due to the emphasis on novelty for publication. We explored the possibility of replicating original findings in the field of microbial and chemical ecology by conducting a conceptual replication of a previous study analysing the sex-specific differences in the microbial communities inhabiting the wing sacs, a scent organ with crucial functions in olfactory communication, of greater sac-winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata). In the original study, the skin swabs from the antebrachial wing sacs of the males and wing sac rudiments of the females were analysed using culture-dependent methods to test sex-specific differences. The authors demonstrated that males have lower microbial richness and different microbial composition than females. We attempted to reproduce these findings using 16S rRNA sequencing, which offers improved accuracy in pinpointing microbial members than culture-dependent methods because of advanced statistical methods. Our study validated the original study's findings: Males had a lower microbial richness, and the community composition differed between the sexes. Furthermore, in the current study, males had an increased abundance of bacteria that might potentially be involved in odour production and degradation of malodorous substances and antimicrobial production. Our conceptual replication study corroborated that microbes can play a role in shaping their host's olfactory phenotype and consequently influence sexual selection. Furthermore, the current study emphasises the importance of replication efforts and hopefully encourages a culture that values replication studies in scientific practice.
