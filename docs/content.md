_Infant, Infant, Newborn, Humans, Infant, Premature, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Pilot Projects, Dysbiosis, Iron, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Dietary Supplements, Feces_
The gastrointestinal microbiome in preterm infants exhibits significant influence on optimal outcomes-with dysbiosis shown to substantially increase the risk of the life-threatening necrotizing enterocolitis. Iron is a vital nutrient especially during the perinatal window of rapid hemoglobin production, tissue growth, and foundational neurodevelopment. However, excess colonic iron exhibits potent oxidation capacity and alters the gut microbiome-potentially facilitating the proliferation of pathological bacterial strains. Breastfed preterm infants routinely receive iron supplementation starting 14 days after delivery and are highly vulnerable to morbidities associated with gastrointestinal dysbiosis. Therefore, we set out to determine if routine iron supplementation alters the preterm gut microbiome.

The gut microbiome is a diverse ecosystem, dominated by bacteria; however, fungi, phages/viruses, archaea, and protozoa are also important members of the gut microbiota. Exploration of taxonomic compositions beyond bacteria as well as an understanding of the interaction between the bacteriome with the other members is limited using 16S rDNA sequencing. Here, we developed a pipeline enabling the simultaneous interrogation of the gut microbiome (bacteriome, mycobiome, archaeome, eukaryome, DNA virome) and of antibiotic resistance genes based on optimized long-read shotgun metagenomics protocols and custom bioinformatics. Using our pipeline we investigated the longitudinal composition of the gut microbiome in an exploratory clinical study in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT; n = 31). Pre-transplantation microbiomes exhibited a 3-cluster structure, characterized by Bacteroides spp. /Phocaeicola spp., mixed composition and Enterococcus abundances. We revealed substantial inter-individual and temporal variabilities of microbial domain compositions, human DNA, and antibiotic resistance genes during the course of alloHSCT. Interestingly, viruses and fungi accounted for substantial proportions of microbiome content in individual samples. In the course of HSCT, bacterial strains were stable or newly acquired. Our results demonstrate the disruptive potential of alloHSCTon the gut microbiome and pave the way for future comprehensive microbiome studies based on long-read metagenomics.

## Donor-recipient intermicrobial interactions impact transfer of subspecies and fecal microbiota transplantation outcome.
 17.02.2024, _Q Chen, C Wu, J Xu, C Ye, X Chen, H Tian, N Zong, S Zhang, L Li, Y Gao, D Zhao, X Lv, Q Yang, L Wang, J Cui, Z Lin, J Lu, R Yang, F Yin, N Qin, N Li, Q Xu, H Qin_


Studies on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have reported inconsistent connections between clinical outcomes and donor strain engraftment. Analyses of subspecies-level crosstalk and its influences on lineage transfer in metagenomic FMT datasets have proved challenging, as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are generally not linked and are often absent. Here, we utilized species genome bin (SGB), which employs co-abundance binning, to investigate subspecies-level microbiome dynamics in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who had gastrointestinal comorbidities and underwent encapsulated FMT (Chinese Clinical Trial: 2100043906). We found that interactions between donor and recipient microbes, which were overwhelmingly phylogenetically divergent, were important for subspecies transfer and positive clinical outcomes. Additionally, a donor-recipient SGB match was indicative of a high likelihood of strain transfer. Importantly, these ecodynamics were shared across FMT datasets encompassing multiple diseases. Collectively, these findings provide detailed insight into specific microbial interactions and dynamics that determine FMT success.

## The gut ileal mucosal virome is disturbed in patients with Crohn's disease and exacerbates intestinal inflammation in mice.
 24.02.2024, _Z Cao, D Fan, Y Sun, Z Huang, Y Li, R Su, F Zhang, Q Li, H Yang, F Zhang, Y Miao, P Lan, X Wu, T Zuo_


Gut bacteriome dysbiosis is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Crohn's disease (CD) is an IBD subtype with extensive mucosal inflammation, yet the mucosal virome, an empirical modulator of the bacteriome and mucosal immunity, remains largely unclear regarding its composition and role. Here, we exploited trans-cohort CD patients and healthy individuals to compositionally and functionally investigate the small bowel (terminal ileum) virome and bacteriome. The CD ileal virome was characterised by an under-representation of both lytic and temperate bacteriophages (especially those targeting bacterial pathogens), particularly in patients with flare-up. Meanwhile, the virome-bacteriome ecology in CD ileal mucosa was featured by a lack of Bifidobacterium- and Lachnospiraceae-led mutualistic interactions between bacteria and bacteriophages; surprisingly it was more pronounced in CD remission than flare-up, underlining the refractory and recurrent nature of mucosal inflammation in CD. Lastly, we substantiated that ileal virions from CD patients causally exacerbated intestinal inflammation in IBD mouse models, by reshaping a gut virome-bacteriome ecology preceding intestinal inflammation (microbial trigger) and augmenting microbial sensing/defence pathways in the intestine cells (host response). Altogether, our results highlight the significance of mucosal virome in CD pathogenesis and importance of mucosal virome restoration in CD therapeutics.

## Identification and Genome Characterization of a Novel Virus within the Genus Totivirus from Chinese Bayberry (Myrica rubra).
 24.02.2024, _Z Xu, Y Gao, K Teng, H Ge, X Zhang, M Wu, R Li, Z Wu, L Zheng_


Chinese bayberry (Myrica rubra) is an economically significant fruit tree native to eastern Asia and widely planted in south-central China. However, studies about the viruses infecting M. rubra remain largely lacking. In the present study, we employed the metatranscriptomic method to identify viruses in M. rubra leaves exhibiting yellowing and irregular margin symptoms collected in Fuzhou, a city located in China's Fujian province in the year 2022. As a consequence, a novel member of the genus Totivirus was identified and tentatively named "Myrica rubra associated totivirus 1" (MRaTV1). The genome sequencing of MRaTV1 was determined by overlapping reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The two deduced proteins encoded by MRaTV1 have the highest amino acid (aa) sequence identity to the coat protein (CP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of Panax notoginseng virus A (PNVA), a member of the genus Totivirus within the family Totiviridae, at 49.7% and 61.7%, respectively. According to the results of the phylogenetic tree and the species demarcation criteria of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) for the genus Totivirus, MRaTV1 is considered a new member of the genus Totivirus.

## Formulation and development of novel Sulfasalazine bilayer tablets for the treatment of arthritis associated with IBD: In-vitro and In-vivo Investigations.
 24.02.2024, _S Jadiya, N Upmanyu, A Sathiyanarayanan, V Jain, R Dubey, P Buwade_


Sulfasalazine needs frequent daily dosing and the administration of numerous tablets per day pose challenges to patient compliance, contributing to increased adverse effects and difficulties in disease control. These inconveniences result in less effective treatment for arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease i.e. ulcerative colitis etc. To improve drug bioavailability, a delayed-release mechanism that releases the drug at the colon is necessary. To develop and optimise colon-targeted controlled release bilayer tablets coated with pH-dependent polymers. The bilayer tablets containing the immediate release part and sustained release part were developed. The tablets were coated with enteric-coated with Eudragit® S-100 and L-100 to achieve release in the colon. Granule properties and tablets were evaluated. The physicochemical parameters of the tablets were evaluated including, stability study, and drug release in 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2), pH 6.8 phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer for 2, 1, and up to 24 hours respectively. Radiographic imaging and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were also done in Rabbits. The bilayer tablets containing immediate and sustained release were successfully developed for the colon targeting. The granule properties were found within the acceptable range indicating good flow properties. The physicochemical properties of the tablets were also found acceptable. The tablets did not show release in 0.1 N HCl and 6.8 phosphate buffer but drug release was found under control in the 7.4 pH buffer. Sulfasalazine coated bilayer tablets were found stable and no significant changes were observed in the stability studies. Based on the X-ray studies, the formulated tablet remained discernible in the stomach, small intestine, and colon for a duration of up to 24 hours. Finally, by the 32nd hour, the tablet was no longer visible in the X-ray examination, leading to the conclusion of complete drug release. The drug concentration in plasma remained within the therapeutic range for up to 24 hours in vivo. These novel formulations present substantial advantages, providing prolonged targeted drug release and reducing systemic adverse effects. The results suggest promising potential for treating arthritis in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, offering a solution to current delivery systems.

## Inter-epitope spacer variation within polytopic L2-based human papillomavirus antigens affects immunogenicity.
 24.02.2024, _Y Zhang, FC Mariz, P Sehr, G Spagnoli, KM Koenig, S Çelikyürekli, T Kreuziger, X Zhao, A Bolchi, S Ottonello, M Müller_


The human papillomavirus minor capsid protein L2 is being extensively explored in pre-clinical studies as an attractive vaccine antigen capable of inducing broad-spectrum prophylactic antibody responses. Recently, we have developed two HPV vaccine antigens - PANHPVAX and CUT-PANHPVAX- both based on heptameric nanoparticle antigens displaying polytopes of the L2 major cross-neutralizing epitopes of eight mucosal and twelve cutaneous HPV types, respectively. Prompted by the variable neutralizing antibody responses against some of the HPV types targeted by the antigens observed in previous studies, here we investigated the influence on immunogenicity of six distinct glycine-proline spacers inserted upstream to a specific L2 epitope. We show that spacer variants differentially influence antigen immunogenicity in a mouse model, with the antigen constructs M8merV6 and C12merV6 displaying a superior ability in the induction of neutralizing antibodies as determined by pseudovirus-based neutralization assays (PBNAs). L2-peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assessments determined the total anti-L2 antibody level for each antigen variant, showing for the majority of sera a correlation with their repective neutralizing antibody level. Surface Plasmon Resonance revealed that L2 epitope-specific, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) display distinct avidities to different antigen spacer variants. Furthermore, mAb affinity toward individual spacer variants was well correlated with their neutralizing antibody induction capacity, indicating that the mAb affinity assay predicts L2-based antigen immunogenicity. These observations provide insights on the development and optimization of L2-based HPV vaccines.

## Cardiac rehabilitation for children and young people (CardioActive): protocol for a single-blind randomised feasibility and acceptability study of a centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programme versus usual care in 11-16 years with heart conditions.
 24.02.2024, _L Capobianco, M Hann, E McManus, S Peters, PJ Doherty, G Ciotti, J Murray, A Wells_


Congenital heart conditions are among the most common non-communicable diseases in children and young people (CYP), affecting 13.9 million CYP globally. While survival rates are increasing, support for young people adjusting to life with a heart condition is lacking. Furthermore, one in three CYP with heart conditions also experiences anxiety, depression or adjustment disorder, for which little support is offered. While adults are offered cardiac rehabilitation (CR) to support their mental and physical health, this is not offered for CYP.One way to overcome this is to evaluate a CR programme comprising exercise with mental health support (CardioActive; CA) for CYP with heart conditions. The exercise and mental health components are informed by the metacognitive model, which has been shown to be effective in treating anxiety and depression in CYP and associated with improving psychological outcomes in adult CR.
