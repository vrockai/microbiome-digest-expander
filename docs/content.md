## Animals and SARS-CoV-2: Species susceptibility and viral transmission in experimental and natural conditions, and the potential implications for community transmission.
 22.10.2020, _EC Hobbs, TJ Reid_


The current COVID-19 global pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of probable bat origin, has highlighted the ongoing need for a One Health response to emerging zoonotic disease events. Understanding the human-animal interface and its relevance to disease transmission remains a critical control point for many emerging zoonoses. Determination of the susceptibility of various animal species to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the role of animals in the epidemiology of the disease will be critical to informing appropriate human and veterinary public health responses to this pandemic. A scoping literature review was conducted to collect, evaluate and present the available research evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals. Experimental studies have successfully demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in cats, ferrets, hamsters, bats and non-human primates under experimental settings. Dogs appear to have limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, while other domestic species including pigs and poultry do not appear susceptible. Naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals appear uncommon, with 14 pets, 8 captive big cats and an unreported number of farmed mink testing positive to date. Infections typically appear asymptomatic in dogs, while clinical signs of respiratory and/or gastrointestinal disease tend to be mild to moderate in felines, and severe to fatal in mink. Most animals are presumed to have been infected by close contact with COVID-19 patients. In domestic settings, viral transmission is self-limiting, however in high density animal environments there can be sustained between-animal transmission. To date, two potential cases of animal-to-human transmission are being investigated, on infected mink farms. Given the millions of COVID-19 cases worldwide and ongoing potential for further zoonotic and anthroponotic viral transmission, further research and surveillance activities are needed to definitively determine the role of animals in community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

## Metabolomics of primary cutaneous melanoma and matched adjacent extratumoral microenvironment.
 31.10.2020, _NJ Taylor, I Gaynanova, SA Eschrich, EA Welsh, TJ Garrett, C Beecher, R Sharma, JM Koomen, KSM Smalley, JL Messina, PA Kanetsky_


Melanoma causes the vast majority of deaths attributable to skin cancer, largely due to its propensity for metastasis. To date, few studies have examined molecular changes between primary cutaneous melanoma and adjacent putatively normal skin. To broaden temporal inferences related to initiation of disease, we performed a metabolomics investigation of primary melanoma and matched extratumoral microenvironment (EM) tissues; and, to make inferences about progressive disease, we also compared unmatched metastatic melanoma tissues to EM tissues.

## Gut microbiota profiles of treatment-naïve adult acute myeloid leukemia patients with neutropenic fever during intensive chemotherapy.
 28.10.2020, _T Rattanathammethee, P Tuitemwong, P Thiennimitr, P Sarichai, S Na Pombejra, P Piriyakhuntorn, S Hantrakool, C Chai-Adisaksopha, E Rattarittamrong, A Tantiworawit, L Norasetthada_


The intestinal bacterial flora of febrile neutropenic patients has been found to be significantly diverse. However, there are few reports of alterations of in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Stool samples of each treatment-naïve AML patient were collected the day before initiation of induction chemotherapy (pretreatment), on the first date of neutropenic fever and first date of bone marrow recovery. Bacterial DNA was extracted from stool samples and bacterial 16s ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced by next-generation sequencing. Relative abundance, overall richness, Shannon's diversity index and Simpson's diversity index were calculated. No antimicrobial prophylaxis was in placed in all participants. Ten cases of AML patients (4 male and 6 female) were included with a median age of 39 years (range: 19-49) and all of patients developed febrile neutropenia. Firmicutes dominated during the period of neutropenic fever, subsequently declining after bone marrow recovery a pattern in contrast to that shown by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Enterococcus was more abundant in the febrile neutropenia period compared to pretreatment (mean difference +20.2; p &lt; 0.0001) while Escherichia notably declined during the same period (mean difference -11.2; p = 0.0064). At the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level, there was a significantly higher level of overall richness in the pretreatment period than in the febrile neutropenic episode (mean OTU of 203.1 vs. 131.7; p = 0.012). Both of the diversity indexes of Shannon and Simpson showed a significant decrease during the febrile neutropenic period. Adult AML patients with a first episode of febrile neutropenia after initial intensive chemotherapy demonstrated a significant decrease in gut microbiota diversity and the level of diversity remained constant despite recovery of bone marrow.

## An Integrated View of the Effects of Wine Polyphenols and Their Relevant Metabolites on Gut and Host Health.

Over the last few decades, polyphenols, and flavonoids in particular, have attracted the interest of researchers, as they have been associated with the health-promoting effects derived from diets rich in vegetables and fruits, including moderate wine consumption. Recent scientific evidence suggests that wine polyphenols exert their effects through interactions with the gut microbiota, as they seem to modulate microbiota and, at the same time, are metabolized by intestinal bacteria into specific bioavailable metabolites. Microbial metabolites are better absorbed than their precursors and may be responsible for positive health activities in the digestive system (local effects) and, after being absorbed, in tissues and organs (systemic effects). Differences in gut microbiota composition and functionality among individuals can affect polyphenol activity and, therefore, their health effects. The aim of this review is to integrate the understanding of the metabolism and mechanisms of action of wine polyphenols at both local and systemic levels, underlining their impact on the gut microbiome and the inter-individual variability associated with polyphenols' metabolism and further physiological effects. The advent of promising dietary approaches linked to wine polyphenols beyond the gut microbiota community and metabolism are also discussed.

## Gut Microbiota: Its Potential Roles in Pancreatic Cancer.
 30.10.2020, _Q Li, M Jin, Y Liu, L Jin_


Pancreatic cancer is considered a lethal disease with a low survival rate due to its late-stage diagnosis, few opportunities for resection and lack of effective therapeutic strategies. Multiple, highly complex effects of gut microbiota on pancreatic cancer have been recognized as potential strategies for targeting tumorigenesis, development and treatment in recent decades; some of the treatments include antibiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. Several bacterial species are associated with carcinogenesis of the pancreas, while some bacterial metabolites contribute to tumor-associated low-grade inflammation and immune responses via several proinflammatory factors and signaling pathways. Given the limited evidence on the interplay between gut microbiota and pancreatic cancer, risk factors associated with pancreatic cancer, such as diabetes, chronic pancreatitis and obesity, should also be taken into consideration. In terms of treatment of pancreatic cancer, gut microbiota has exhibited multiple effects on both traditional chemotherapy and the recently successful immunotherapy. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the latest developments and advancements in gut microbiota in relation to pancreatic cancer to elucidate its potential value.

## Biological invasions alter environmental microbiomes: A meta-analysis.
 28.10.2020, _A Malacrinò, VA Sadowski, TK Martin, N Cavichiolli de Oliveira, IJ Brackett, JD Feller, KJ Harris, O Combita Heredia, R Vescio, AE Bennett_


Biological invasions impact both agricultural and natural systems. The damage can be quantified in terms of both economic loss and reduction of biodiversity. Although the literature is quite rich about the impact of invasive species on plant and animal communities, their impact on environmental microbiomes is underexplored. Here, we re-analyze publicly available data using a common framework to create a global synthesis of the effects of biological invasions on environmental microbial communities. Our findings suggest that non-native species are responsible for the loss of microbial diversity and shifts in the structure of microbial populations. Therefore, the impact of biological invasions on native ecosystems might be more pervasive than previously thought, influencing both macro- and micro-biomes. We also identified gaps in the literature which encourage research on a wider variety of environments and invaders, and the influence of invaders across seasons and geographical ranges.

## T cell immunity to commensal fungi.
 29.10.2020, _A Scheffold, P Bacher, S LeibundGut-Landmann_


Fungi are an important part of the microbiota in healthy barrier tissues. Fungal dysbiosis in turn is associated with local and distal inflammatory diseases. Recent advances have shed light on the antigen-specific IL-17-dependent mechanisms that regulate fungal commensalism and prevent fungal overgrowth during homeostasis. Progress in our understanding of species-specific differences in fungus-host interactions provides new hypotheses of why Candida albicans-targeting T cells exceed those directed against other fungal species in the human T cell repertoire. Importantly, C. albicans-specific Th17 cells can also contribute to immune pathology in distant organs such as the lung via cross-reaction with heterologous antigens.

## Prometheus, an omics portal for interkingdom comparative genomic analyses.
 28.10.2020, _G Ko, I Jang, N Koo, SJ Park, SH Oh, MS Kim, JH Choi, H Kim, YM Sim, I Byeon, PG Kim, KY Kim, JC Yoon, KL Mun, B Lee, G Han, YM Kim_


Functional analyses of genes are crucial for unveiling biological responses, genetic engineering, and developing new medicines. However, functional analyses have largely been restricted to model organisms, representing a major hurdle for functional studies and industrial applications. To resolve this, comparative genome analyses can be used to provide clues to gene functions as well as their evolutionary history. To this end, we present Prometheus, a web-based omics portal that contains more than 17,215 sequences from prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. This portal supports interkingdom comparative analyses via a domain architecture-based gene identification system and Gene Search, and users can easily and rapidly identify single or entire gene sets in specific pathways. Bioinformatics tools for further analyses are provided in Prometheus or through Bio-Express, a cloud-based bioinformatics analysis platform. Prometheus is a new paradigm for comparative analyses of large amounts of genomic information.
