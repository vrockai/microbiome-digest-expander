## Association of GRIA1 polymorphisms with ovarian response to human menopausal gonadotropin in Iranian women.
 23.08.2020, _H Golestanpour, G Javadi, MH Sheikhha_


Glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 1 (GRIA1) is a subunit of a ligand-gated ion channel that regulates the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by controlling the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Few studies have investigated the association between the GRIA1 gene and human infertility. This study evaluated the association of the GRIA1 rs548294 C &gt; T and rs2195450 G &gt; A polymorphisms with the ovarian response to human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) in Iranian women.

The characterization of the microbial population of many niches of the organism, as the gastrointestinal tract, is now possible thanks to the use of high-throughput DNA sequencing technique. Several studies in the companion animals field already investigated faecal microbiome in healthy or affected subjects, although the methodologies used in the different laboratories and the limited number of animals recruited in each experiment does not allow a straight comparison among published results. In the present study, we report data collected from several in house researches carried out in healthy dogs, with the aim to seek for a variability of microbial taxa in the faeces, caused by factors such as diet and sex. The database contains 340 samples from 132 dogs, collected serially during dietary intervention studies. The procedure of samples collection, storage, DNA extraction and sequencing, bioinformatic and statistical analysis followed a standardized pipeline. Microbial profiles of faecal samples have been analyzed applying dimensional reduction discriminant analysis followed by random forest analysis to the relative abundances of genera in the feces as variables. The results supported the responsiveness of microbiota at a genera taxonomic level to dietary factor and allowed to cluster dogs according this factor with high accuracy. Also sex factor clustered dogs, with castrated males and spayed females forming a separated group in comparison to intact dogs, strengthening the hypothesis of a bidirectional interaction between microbiota and endocrine status of the host. The findings of the present analysis are promising for a better comprehension of the mechanisms that regulate the connection of the microorganisms living the gastrointestinal tract with the diet and the host. This preliminary study deserves further investigation for the identification of the factors affecting faecal microbiome in dogs.

## Spider phylosymbiosis: divergence of widow spider species and their tissues' microbiomes.
 21.08.2020, _SJ Dunaj, BR Bettencourt, JE Garb, RM Brucker_


Microbiomes can have profound impacts on host biology and evolution, but to date, remain vastly understudied in spiders despite their unique and diverse predatory adaptations. This study evaluates closely related species of spiders and their host-microbe relationships in the context of phylosymbiosis, an eco-evolutionary pattern where the microbial community profile parallels the phylogeny of closely related host species. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we characterized the microbiomes of five species with known phylogenetic relationships from the family Theridiidae, including multiple closely related widow spiders (L. hesperus, L. mactans, L. geometricus, S. grossa, and P. tepidariorum).
