Despite antibiotic prophylaxis, most patients with acute leukemia receiving mucotoxic chemotherapy develop neutropenic fever (NF), many cases of which remain without a documented etiology. Antibiotics disrupt the gut microbiota, with adverse clinical consequences such as Clostridioides difficile infection. A better understanding of NF pathogenesis could inform the development of novel therapeutics without deleterious effects on the microbiota. We hypothesized that metabolites absorbed from the gut to the bloodstream modulate pyrogenic and inflammatory pathways. Longitudinal profiling of the gut microbiota in two cohorts of patients with acute leukemia showed that Akkermansia expansion in the gut was associated with increased risk of NF. As a prototype mucolytic genus, Akkermansia may influence the absorption of luminal metabolites, thus its association with NF supported our metabolomic hypothesis. Longitudinal profiling of the serum metabolome identified a signature associated with gut Akkermansia and one with NF. Importantly, these two signatures overlapped in metabolites in the γ-glutamyl cycle, suggesting oxidative stress as a mediator involved in Akkermansia-related NF. In addition, the level of gut microbial-derived indole compounds increased after Akkermansia expansion and decreased before NF, suggesting their role in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of Akkermansia as seen predominantly in healthy individuals. These results suggest that Akkermansia regulates microbiota-host metabolic cross-talk by modulating the mucosal interface. The clinical context including factors influencing microbiota composition determines the type of metabolites absorbed through the gut barrier and their net effect on the host. Our findings identify novel aspects of NF pathogenesis that could be targets for precision therapeutics. (Registration number in ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03316456).

## Gut microbiota dependent trimethylamine N-oxide aggravates angiotensin II-induced hypertension.
 05.09.2021, _S Jiang, Y Shui, Y Cui, C Tang, X Wang, X Qiu, W Hu, L Fei, Y Li, S Zhang, L Zhao, N Xu, F Dong, X Ren, R Liu, PB Persson, A Patzak, EY Lai, Q Wei, Z Zheng_


Gut microbiota produce Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) by metabolizing dietary phosphatidylcholine, choline, l-carnitine and betaine. TMAO is implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, obesity and atherosclerosis. We test, whether TMAO augments angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced vasoconstriction and hence promotes Ang II-induced hypertension. Plasma TMAO levels were indeed elevated in hypertensive patients, thus the potential pathways by which TMAO mediates these effects were explored. Ang II (400 ng/kg-1min-1) was chronically infused for 14 days via osmotic minipumps in C57Bl/6 mice. TMAO (1%) or antibiotics were given via drinking water. Vasoconstriction of renal afferent arterioles and mesenteric arteries were assessed by microperfusion and wire myograph, respectively. In Ang II-induced hypertensive mice, TMAO elevated systolic blood pressure and caused vasoconstriction, which was alleviated by antibiotics. TMAO enhanced the Ang II-induced acute pressor responses (12.2 ± 1.9 versus 20.6 ± 1.4 mmHg; P &lt; 0.05) and vasoconstriction (32.3 ± 2.6 versus 55.9 ± 7.0%, P &lt; 0.001). Ang II-induced intracellular Ca2+ release in afferent arterioles (147 ± 7 versus 234 ± 26%; P &lt; 0.001) and mouse vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC, 123 ± 3 versus 157 ± 9%; P &lt; 0.001) increased by TMAO treatment. Preincubation of VSMC with TMAO activated the PERK/ROS/CaMKII/PLCβ3 pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of PERK, ROS, CaMKII and PLCβ3 impaired the effect of TMAO on Ca2+ release. Thus, TMAO facilitates Ang II-induced vasoconstriction, thereby promoting Ang II-induced hypertension, which involves the PERK/ROS/CaMKII/PLCβ3 axis.

## Quantifying rapid bacterial evolution and transmission within the mouse intestine.

Due to limitations on high-resolution strain tracking, selection dynamics during gut microbiota colonization and transmission between hosts remain mostly mysterious. Here, we introduced hundreds of barcoded Escherichia coli strains into germ-free mice and quantified strain-level dynamics and metagenomic changes. Mutations in genes involved in motility and metabolite utilization are reproducibly selected within days. Even with rapid selection, coprophagy enforced similar barcode distributions across co-housed mice. Whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of isolates revealed linked alleles that demonstrate between-host transmission. A population-genetics model predicts substantial fitness advantages for certain mutants and that migration accounted for ∼10% of the resident microbiota each day. Treatment with ciprofloxacin suggests interplay between selection and transmission. While initial colonization was mostly uniform, in two mice a bottleneck reduced diversity and selected for ciprofloxacin resistance in the absence of drug. These findings highlight the interplay between environmental transmission and rapid, deterministic selection during evolution of the intestinal microbiota.

Accumulating evidence indicates that free amino acids (FAA) might be bioactive compounds with potential immunomodulatory capabilities. However, the FAA composition in human milk is still poorly characterized with respect to its correlation to maternal serum levels and its physiological significance for the infant. Studies addressing the relation of human milk FAA to the infants' intestinal microbiota are still missing.

## Sickle cell disease children's gut colonization by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales: an antibiotic prophylaxis effect?
 03.09.2021, _ASS Monteiro, EG Oliveira, DBD Santos, SM Cordeiro, RD Couto, FD Couto_


Introduction. Sickle cell disease (SCD) children have a high susceptibility to pneumococcal infection. For this reason, they are routinely immunized with pneumococcal vaccines and use antibiotic prophylaxis (AP).Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Yet, little is known about SCD children's gut microbiota. If antibiotic-resistant Enterobacterales may colonize people on AP, we hypothesized that SCD children on AP are colonized by resistant enterobacteria species.Objective. To evaluate the effect of continuous AP on Enterobacterales gut colonization from children with SCD.Methodology. We analysed 30 faecal swabs from SCD children on AP and 21 swabs from children without the same condition. Enterobacterales was isolated on MacConkey agar plates and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). We performed the antibiogram by Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and the resistance genes were identified by multiplex PCR.Results. We found four different species with resistance to one or more different antibiotic types in the AP-SCD children's group: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, and Citrobacter farmeri. Colonization by resistant E. coli was associated with AP (prevalence ratio 2.69, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.98-3.67, P&lt;0.001). Strains producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) were identified only in SCD children, E. coli, 4/30 (13 %), and K. pneumoniae, 2/30 (7 %). The ESBL-producing Enterobacterales were associated with penicillin G benzathine use (95 % CI, 22.91-86.71, P&lt;0.001). CTX-M-1 was the most prevalent among ESBL-producers (3/6, 50 %), followed by CTX-M-9 (2/6, 33 %), and CTX-M-2 (1/6, 17 %).Conclusion. Resistant enterobacteria colonize SCD children on AP, and this therapy raises the chance of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales colonization. Future studies should focus on prophylactic vaccines as exclusive therapy against pneumococcal infections.

## Disruption of the oral microbiota is associated with a higher risk of relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
 03.09.2021, _VC de Molla, V Heidrich, JS Bruno, FH Knebel, W Miranda-Silva, PF Asprino, L Tucunduva, V Rocha, Y Novis, AA Camargo, ER Fregnani, C Arrais-Rodrigues_


Intestinal microbiota (IM) diversity and composition regulates host immunity and affects outcomes after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We evaluated if the oral mucosa microbiota (OM) could impact the outcomes in patients who underwent allo-HSCT. Samples from the oral mucosa of 30 patients were collected at three time points: before the conditioning regimen, at aplasia, and at engraftment. We analyzed the associations of OM diversity and composition with allo-HSCT outcomes. Lower OM diversity at preconditioning was associated with a higher risk of relapse at 3 years (68% versus 33%, respectively; P = 0.04). Dominance (relative abundance ≥ 30%) by a single genus at preconditioning was also associated with a higher risk of relapse (63% versus 36% at 3 years, respectively; P = 0.04), as well as worse progression-free survival (PFS; 19% versus 55%, respectively; P = 0.01), and overall survival (OS) at 3 years (38% versus 81%, respectively; P = 0.02). In our study we observed that OM dysbiosis is associated with a higher risk of relapse and worse survival after allo-HSCT.

## Delivery mode and perinatal antibiotics influence the predicted metabolic pathways of the gut microbiome.
 05.09.2021, _P Vänni, MV Tejesvi, S Ainonen, M Renko, K Korpela, J Salo, N Paalanne, T Tapiainen_


Delivery mode and perinatal antibiotics influence gut microbiome composition in children. Most microbiome studies have used the sequencing of the bacterial 16S marker gene but have not reported the metabolic function of the gut microbiome, which may mediate biological effects on the host. Here, we used the PICRUSt2 bioinformatics tool to predict the functional profiles of the gut microbiome based on 16S sequencing in two child cohorts. Both Caesarean section and perinatal antibiotics markedly influenced the functional profiles of the gut microbiome at the age of 1 year. In machine learning analysis, bacterial fatty acid, phospholipid, and biotin biosynthesis were the most important pathways that differed according to delivery mode. Proteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis, carbohydrate degradation, pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide and biotin biosynthesis were the most important pathways differing according to antibiotic exposure. Our study shows that both Caesarean section and perinatal antibiotics markedly influence the predicted metabolic profiles of the gut microbiome at the age of 1 year.

## Recent progress in research on the gut microbiota and highland adaptation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
 02.09.2021, _K Liu, J Yang, H Yuan_


Microbial communities that inhabit the host's intestine influence many aspects of the host's health and bear adaptive potential to alterations in harsh environments and diets. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau represents one of the harshest environments in the world. Preliminary progress has been made in identifying the communities of gut microbes in Indigenous Tibetans and non-human animals. However, due to the complexity of microbial communities, the effects of gut microbes on the host's health and high-plateau adaptation remain unexplained. Herein, we review the latest progress in identifying factors affecting the gut microbiota of native Tibetans and non-human animals and highlight the complex interactions between the gut microbiota, health and highland adaptation, which provides a basis for exploring the correlations between the gut microbiota and clinical indexes in native highland residents and travellers, as well as developing microbiota-based strategies to mitigate health risks for tourists and treatments for mountain sickness during high-altitude travel in the future.

## Investigating dairy microbiome: an opportunity to ensure quality, safety and typicity.
 02.09.2021, _I Ferrocino, K Rantsiou, L Cocolin_


A detailed understanding of the microbiome of cheese and dairy products is key to the optimization of flavour, appearance, overall quality and safety. Microorganisms (including bacteria, yeasts, moulds and viruses, especially bacteriophages) from the environment can enter the dairy supply chain at multiple stages with several implications. The ability to track these microorganisms and to understand their function and interaction can be greatly enhanced by the use of high-throughput sequencing. Depending on the specific production technology, dairy products can harbor several strains and antibiotic-resistance genes that can potentially interact with the gut microbiome, once the product is ingested. Milk-associated or cheese-associated microbial communities with their interaction, function and diversity are a key factor for the dairy industry. Multi-omics approaches have been seldom utilized in literature and they need to be further considered. Studying the role, origin, diversity and function of the microbial species involved in the complex system of dairy production can help improve processes in several fields of application. Integrating an extensive sampling procedure with an extensive culture based methodology is necessary. To this end, local producers, and in general stakeholders, should be guided to discover and maintain their microbial diversity. A better management of microbial resources through precision fermentation processes will in turn reduce overall food losses and increase the possibility to use the microbiome in order to increase the local producers' income.

## Novel approaches to intervene gut microbiota in the treatment of chronic liver diseases.
 03.09.2021, _C Liu, YL Wang, YY Yang, NP Zhang, C Niu, XZ Shen, J Wu_


Recent investigations of gut microbiota have contributed to understanding of the critical role of microbial community in pathophysiology. Dysbiosis not only causes disturbance directly to the gastrointestinal tract but also affects the liver through gut-liver axis. Various types of dysbiosis have been documented in alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis, and may be crucial for the initiation, progression, or deterioration to end-stage liver disease. A few microbial species have been identified as the causal factors leading to these chronic illnesses that either do not have clear etiologies or lack effective treatment. Notably, cytolysin-producing Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus gallinarum were defined for ALD, NASH, and AIH, respectively. These groundbreaking discoveries drive a rapid development in innovative therapeutics, such as fecal microbial transplantation and implementation of specific bacteriophages in addition to prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics for intervention of dysbiosis. Although most emerging interventions are in preclinical development or early clinical trials, a better delineation of specific dysbiosis in these disorders at metabolic, immunogenic, or molecular levels in establishing particular causal effects aids in modulating or correcting the microbial community which is the part of daily life for human being.

## Tryptophan-derived serotonin-kynurenine balance in immune activation and intestinal inflammation.
 03.09.2021, _S Haq, JA Grondin, WI Khan_


Endogenous tryptophan metabolism pathways lead to the production of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), kynurenine, and several downstream metabolites which are involved in a multitude of immunological functions in both health and disease states. Ingested tryptophan is largely shunted to the kynurenine pathway (95%) while only minor portions (1%-2%) are sequestered for 5-HT production. Though often associated with the functioning of the central nervous system, significant production of 5-HT, kynurenine and their downstream metabolites takes place within the gut. Accumulating evidence suggests that these metabolites have essential roles in regulating immune cell function, intestinal inflammation, as well as in altering the production and suppression of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, both 5-HT and kynurenine have a considerable influence on gut microbiota suggesting that these metabolites impact host physiology both directly and indirectly via compositional changes. It is also now evident that complex interactions exist between the two pathways to maintain gut homeostasis. Alterations in 5-HT and kynurenine are implicated in the pathogenesis of many gastrointestinal dysfunctions, including inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, these pathways present numerous potential therapeutic targets, manipulation of which may aid those suffering from gastrointestinal disorders. This review aims to update both the role of 5-HT and kynurenine in immune regulation and intestinal inflammation, and analyze the current knowledge of the relationship and interactions between 5-HT and kynurenine pathways.

## Effects of gut microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles on obesity and diabetes and their potential modulation through diet.
 04.09.2021, _E Díez-Sainz, FI Milagro, JI Riezu-Boj, S Lorente-Cebrián_


Obesity and diabetes incidence rates are increasing dramatically, reaching pandemic proportions. Therefore, there is an urgent need to unravel the mechanisms underlying their pathophysiology. Of particular interest is the close interconnection between gut microbiota dysbiosis and obesity and diabetes progression. Hence, microbiota manipulation through diet has been postulated as a promising therapeutic target. In this regard, secretion of gut microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles is gaining special attention, standing out as key factors that could mediate gut microbiota-host communication. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from gut microbiota and probiotic bacteria allow to encapsulate a wide range of bioactive molecules (such as/or including proteins and nucleic acids) that could travel short and long distances to modulate important biological functions with the overall impact on the host health. EV-derived from specific bacteria induce differential physiological responses. For example, a high-fat diet-induced increase of the proteobacterium Pseudomonas panacis-derived EV is closely associated with the progression of metabolic dysfunction in mice. In contrast, Akkermansia muciniphila EV are linked with the alleviation of high-fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes in mice. Here, we review the newest pieces of evidence concerning the potential role of gut microbiota and probiotic-derived EV on obesity and diabetes onset, progression, and management, through the modulation of inflammation, metabolism, and gut permeability. In addition, we discuss the role of certain dietary patterns on gut microbiota-derived EV profile and the clinical implication that dietary habits could have on metabolic diseases progression through the shaping of gut microbiota-derived EV.

## Integrated Bacterial and Fungal Diversity Analysis Reveals the Gut Microbial Alterations in Diarrheic Giraffes.
 04.09.2021, _A Li, B Liu, F Li, Y He, L Wang, M Fakhar-E-Alam Kulyar, H Li, Y Fu, H Zhu, Y Wang, X Jiang_


Gut microbiota has been demonstrated to be associated with multiple gastrointestinal diseases, but information regarding the gut microbial alternations in diarrheic giraffe remains scarce. Here, 16S rDNA and ITS gene amplicon sequencing were conducted to investigate the gut microbial composition and variability in diarrheic giraffes. Results demonstrated that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most dominant phyla in the gut bacterial community, whereas Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were observed to be predominant in the gut fungal community regardless of health status. However, the species and relative abundance of preponderant bacterial and fungal genera in healthy and diarrheic giraffes were different. In contrast to the relatively stabilized gut fungal community, gut bacterial community displayed a significant decrease in the alpha diversity, accompanied by distinct changes in taxonomic compositions. Bacterial taxonomic analysis revealed that the relative abundances of eight phyla and 12 genera obviously increased, whereas the relative abundances of two phyla and eight genera dramatically decreased during diarrhea. Moreover, the relative richness of five fungal genera significantly increased, whereas the relative richness of seven fungal genera significantly declined in diarrheic giraffes. Taken together, this study demonstrated that diarrhea could cause significant alternations in the gut microbial composition of giraffes, and the changes in the gut bacterial community were more significant than those in the gut fungal community. Additionally, investigating the gut microbial characteristics of giraffes in different health states is beneficial to provide a theoretical basis for establishing a prevention and treatment system for diarrhea from the gut microbial perspective.

## Comparative study of gut microbiota from captive and confiscated-rescued wild pangolins.
 03.09.2021, _C Liu, J Hu, Y Wu, DM Irwin, W Chen, Z Zhang, L Yu_


Pangolins are among the most critically endangered animals due to widespread poaching and worldwide trafficking. Captive breeding is considered to be one way to protect them and increase the sizes of their populations. However, comparative studies of captive and wild pangolins in the context of gut microbiota are rare. Here, the gut microbiome of captive and confiscated-rescued wild pangolins is compared, and the effects of different periods of captivity and captivity with and without antibiotic treatment are considered. We show that different diets and periods of captivity, as well as the application of antibiotic therapy, can alter gut community composition and abundance in pangolins. Compared to wild pangolins, captive pangolins have an increased capacity for chitin and cellulose/hemicellulose degradation, fatty acid metabolism, and short-chain fatty acid synthesis, but a reduced ability to metabolize exogenous substances. In addition to increasing the ability of the gut microbiota to metabolize nutrients in captivity, captive breeding imposes some risks for survival by resulting in a greater abundance of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in captive pangolins than in wild pangolins. Our study is important for the development of guidelines for pangolin conservation, including health assessment, disease prevention, and rehabilitation of wild pangolin populations.

## Sugar feeding protects against arboviral infection by enhancing gut immunity in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti.
 05.09.2021, _F Almire, S Terhzaz, S Terry, M McFarlane, RJ Gestuveo, AM Szemiel, M Varjak, A McDonald, A Kohl, E Pondeville_


As mosquito females require a blood meal to reproduce, they can act as vectors of numerous pathogens, such as arboviruses (e.g. Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses), which constitute a substantial worldwide public health burden. In addition to blood meals, mosquito females can also take sugar meals to get carbohydrates for their energy reserves. It is now recognised that diet is a key regulator of health and disease outcome through interactions with the immune system. However, this has been mostly studied in humans and model organisms. So far, the impact of sugar feeding on mosquito immunity and in turn, how this could affect vector competence for arboviruses has not been explored. Here, we show that sugar feeding increases and maintains antiviral immunity in the digestive tract of the main arbovirus vector Aedes aegypti. Our data demonstrate that the gut microbiota does not mediate the sugar-induced immunity but partly inhibits it. Importantly, sugar intake prior to an arbovirus-infected blood meal further protects females against infection with arboviruses from different families. Sugar feeding blocks arbovirus initial infection and dissemination from the gut and lowers infection prevalence and intensity, thereby decreasing the transmission potential of female mosquitoes. Finally, we show that the antiviral role of sugar is mediated by sugar-induced immunity. Overall, our findings uncover a crucial role of sugar feeding in mosquito antiviral immunity which in turn decreases vector competence for arboviruses. Since Ae. aegypti almost exclusively feed on blood in some natural settings, our findings suggest that this lack of sugar intake could increase the spread of mosquito-borne arboviral diseases.

## Bacterial community dynamics on bats and the implications for pathogen resistance.
 02.09.2021, _A Li, Z Li, W Dai, KL Parise, H Leng, L Jin, S Liu, K Sun, JR Hoyt, J Feng_


The bats skin microbiota plays an important role in reduce pathogen infection, including the deadly fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative agent of white-nose syndrome. However, the dynamic of skin bacterial communities response to environmental perturbations remains poorly described. We characterized skin bacterial community over time and space in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, a species with high resistance to the infection with P. destructans. We collected environmental covariate data to determine what factors influenced changes in community structure. We observed significant temporal and spatial shifts in the skin bacterial community, which was mainly associated with variation in operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The skin bacterial community differed by the environmental microbial reservoirs and was most influenced by host body condition, bat roosting temperature and geographic distance between sites, but was not influenced by pathogen infection. Furthermore, the skin microbiota was enriched in particular taxa with antifungal abilities, such as Enterococcus, Burkholderia, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, and Rhodococcus. And specific strains of Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, and Rhodococcus even inhibited P. destructans growth. Our findings provide new insights in characterizing the variation in bacterial communities can inform us about the processes of driving community assembly and predict the host's ability to resist or survive pathogen infection.

## Gut microbiota and metabolites of α-synuclein transgenic monkey models with early stage of Parkinson's disease.
 03.09.2021, _Y Yan, S Ren, Y Duan, C Lu, Y Niu, Z Wang, B Inglis, W Ji, Y Zheng, W Si_


Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. However, it is unclear whether microbiota and metabolites have demonstrated changes at early PD due to the difficulties in diagnosis and identification of early PD in clinical practice. In a previous study, we generated A53T transgenic monkeys with early Parkinson's symptoms, including anxiety and cognitive impairment. Here we analyzed the gut microbiota by metagenomic sequencing and metabolites by targeted gas chromatography. The gut microbiota analysis showed that the A53T monkeys have higher degree of diversity in gut microbiota with significantly elevated Sybergistetes, Akkermansia, and Eggerthella lenta compared with control monkeys. Prevotella significantly decreased in A53T transgenic monkeys. Glyceric acid, L-Aspartic acid, and p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid were significantly elevated, whereas Myristic acid and 3-Methylindole were significantly decreased in A53T monkeys. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (KO0131) and the oxidative phosphorylation reaction (KO2147) were significantly increased in metabolic pathways of A53T monkeys. Our study suggested that the transgenic A53T and α-syn aggregation may affect the intestine microbiota and metabolites of rhesus monkeys, and the identified five compositional different metabolites that are mainly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction may be related to the pathogenesis of PD.

## Eugenol Alleviates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis Independent of Intestinal Microbiota in Mice.
 03.09.2021, _S Chen, X Wu, S Tang, J Yin, Z Song, X He, Y Yin_


The present study investigated the effect of eugenol (EUG) on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and explored the underlying mechanisms. C57BL/6 mice were intragastrically administered normal saline or EUG (20 mg/kg body weight) for 17 days, and colitis was induced by using 3% DSS from day 7. The results showed that EUG increased the body weight and reduced the disease activity index score and colon pathological scores in DSS-treated mice (P &lt; 0.05). Further, EUG preserved the proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, -12, -21, and -23), lowered (P &lt; 0.05) colonic malondialdehyde (MDA), uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) expression and p65 phosphorylation, and activated (P &lt; 0.05) colonic kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 expressions but did not affect the intestinal microbiota in DSS-treated mice. Furthermore, EUG ameliorated colitis in antibiotic-treated mice, while fecal microbiota transplantation from EUG preadministered mice failed to ameliorate colitis. In conclusion, EUG could alleviate colitis by attenuating colonic inflammation and oxidative stress independent of intestinal microbiota.

Stress during pregnancy is not only detrimental to a woman's own physical and mental health, but can also cause changes in the intrauterine environment and even have an impact on later growth and development, this study was designed to understand the changes of gut microbiota in the maternal and offspring caused by prenatal chronic stress, and to explore the regulatory effect of LBP on gut microbiota, and then to improve the emotional damage caused by prenatal chronic stress in the offspring. A rat model of prenatal chronic stress was made and used LBP to intervene by gavage. Fresh feces of offspring were collected, the concentration of microbial metabolites were tested by ELISA. Illumina MiSeqPE300 sequencing technology was used to determine the sequence of 16S rRNA V3-V4 of microorganisms. On the PND 42, the emotional function of offspring were tested by open-field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT) and tail of suspend test (TST). Results indicated that stress factors increased the plasma corticosterone level of rats during pregnancy and they appeared depressive behaviors. The body weight of offspring during prenatal chronic stress was lower than the control group, and the plasma corticosterone level was increased. Prenatal chronic stress had a significant impact on emotional performance of the offspring on OFT, SPT and TST. Alpha diversity of gut microbiota and microbiota composition in offspring of prenatal chronic stress was attenuated and some relationships existed between these parameters. LBP treatment reduced offspring's plasma corticosterone level and improved their body weight, changed the emotional function, increased the diversity of gut microbiota. Collectively, these findings disclose that prenatal chronic stress not only causes emotional injury on the offspring, but also changes the gut microbiota of the mother and offspring; LBP may regulate the intestinal flora of the mother, then reducing the influence of stress factors on the emotional injury of offspring.

## Galacto-oligosaccharides as infant prebiotics: production, application, bioactive activities and future perspectives.
 03.09.2021, _V Ambrogi, F Bottacini, L Cao, B Kuipers, M Schoterman, D van Sinderen_


Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are non-digestible oligosaccharides characterized by a mix of structures that vary in their degree of polymerization (DP) and glycosidic linkage between the galactose moieties or between galactose and glucose. They have enjoyed extensive scientific scrutiny, and their health-promoting effects are supported by a large number of scientific and clinical studies. A variety of GOS-associated health-promoting effects have been reported, such as growth promotion of beneficial bacteria, in particular bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, inhibition of pathogen adhesion and improvement of gut barrier function. GOS have attracted significant interest from food industries for their versatility as a bioactive ingredient and in particular as a functional component of infant formulations. These oligosaccharides are produced in a kinetically-controlled reaction involving lactose transgalactosylation, being catalyzed by particular β-galactosidases of bacterial or fungal origin. Despite the well-established technology applied for GOS production, this process may still meet with technological challenges when employed at an industrial scale. The current review will cover relevant scientific literature on the beneficial physiological properties of GOS as a prebiotic for the infant gut microbiota, details of GOS structures, the associated reaction mechanism of β-galactosidase, and its (large-scale) production.

## Synbiotics Containing Nanoprebiotics: A Novel Therapeutic Strategy to Restore Gut Dysbiosis.
 04.09.2021, _L Hong, SM Lee, WS Kim, YJ Choi, SH Oh, YL Li, SH Choi, DH Chung, E Jung, SK Kang, CS Cho_


A new formulation, nanoprebiotics [e.g., phthalyl pullulan nanoparticles (PPNs)], was demonstrated to enhance the antimicrobial activity of probiotics [e.g., Lactobacillus plantarum (LP)] in vitro through intracellular stimulation better than that by backbone prebiotics, which are commonly used. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether this combination would exert distinct effects as synbiotics in vivo. Synbiotics combinations of LP, pullulan, and PPNs were used as experimental treatments in a dysbiosis-induced murine model, and their restorative effect was assessed using pathogen Escherichia coli K99 challenge. Our results showed that the E. coli infection was suppressed markedly in the experimental group fed with synbiotics containing PPNs. In addition, the decrease in serum endotoxin level after synbiotics treatment suggested the reinforcement of the gut barrier. Comparison of treatment groups, including a normal control group, showed that synbiotics containing PPNs increased microbial diversity, which is a representative parameter of healthy status. Furthermore, distinct from probiotics treatment alone, synbiotics showed additive effects of enrichment of several well-known beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and other butyrate-producing bacteria including Faecalibacterium. Collectively, our results indicate that synbiotics containing PPNs are effective at restoring gut dysbiosis, suppressing pathogenic infection, and increasing microbial diversity, suggesting that synbiotics with nanoprebiotics have the potential to be a novel strategy for ameliorating gut dysbiosis and infectious diseases.

## Comparative Metagenomics of the Active Layer and Permafrost from Low-Carbon Soil in the Canadian High Arctic.

Approximately 87% of the Arctic consists of low-organic carbon mineral soil, but knowledge of microbial activity in low-carbon permafrost (PF) and active layer soils remains limited. This study investigated the taxonomic composition and genetic potential of microbial communities at contrasting depths of the active layer (5, 35, and 65 cm below surface, bls) and PF (80 cm bls). We showed microbial communities in PF to be taxonomically and functionally different from those in the active layer. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed higher biodiversity in the active layer than in PF, and biodiversity decreased significantly with depth. The reconstructed 91 metagenome-assembled genomes showed that PF was dominated by heterotrophic, fermenting Bacteroidota using nitrite as their main electron acceptor. Prevalent microbes identified in the active layer belonged to bacterial taxa, gaining energy via aerobic respiration. Gene abundance in metagenomes revealed enrichment of genes encoding the plant-derived polysaccharide degradation and metabolism of nitrate and sulfate in PF, whereas genes encoding methane/ammonia oxidation, cold-shock protein, and two-component systems were generally more abundant in the active layer, particularly at 5 cm bls. The results of this study deepen our understanding of the low-carbon Arctic soil microbiome and improve prediction of the impacts of thawing PF.

## High-resolution microbiome analysis enabled by linking of 16S rRNA gene sequences with adjacent genomic contexts.

Sequence-based characterization of bacterial communities has long been a hostage of limitations of both 16S rRNA gene and whole metagenome sequencing. Neither approach is universally applicable, and the main efforts to resolve constraints have been devoted to improvement of computational prediction tools. Here, we present semi-targeted 16S rRNA sequencing (st16S-seq), a method designed for sequencing V1-V2 regions of the 16S rRNA gene along with the genomic locus upstream of the gene. By in silico analysis of 13 570 bacterial genome assemblies, we show that genome-linked 16S rRNA sequencing is superior to individual hypervariable regions or full-length gene sequences in terms of classification accuracy and identification of gene copy numbers. Using mock communities and soil samples we experimentally validate st16S-seq and benchmark it against the established microbial classification techniques. We show that st16S-seq delivers accurate estimation of 16S rRNA gene copy numbers, enables taxonomic resolution at the species level and closely approximates community structures obtainable by whole metagenome sequencing.
