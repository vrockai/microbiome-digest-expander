Diet has an important role in host-microbiome interplay, which may result in intestinal permeability changes and physiopathological effects at a systemic level. Despite the importance of maternal microbiota as the main contributor to the initial microbial seeding, little is known about the effects of maternal diet during pregnancy on maternal-neonatal microbiota.

The vaginal microbiota of healthy women typically has low diversity, which increases after perturbations. Among these, lifestyle associated with certain sexual and antimicrobial practices may be associated with higher diversity. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the vaginal microbiota in the cervicovaginal and introital sites in sexually active Amerindians (N = 82) spanning urbanization, and in urban mestizos (N = 29), in the Venezuelan Amazonas. HPV status was also considered. Sampling was performed in an urban gradient from remote villages to a town, and women were individually classified by the degree of urbanization (low, medium, and high). Amerindian cervicovaginal and introital microbiota diversity were not associated with major changes in urbanization or ethnicity. There was a non-significant trend of increased diversity with urbanization, with a few taxa found overrepresented in urban Amerindians (Brevibacterium linens and Peptoniphilus lacrimalis) or mestizos (Mobiluncus mulieris and Prevotella sp.). Among all women, cervicovaginal and introital samples clustered, respectively, in four and two community state types (CSTs), where most profiles were dominated by Lactobacillus iners, Gardnerella vaginalis or were highly diverse profiles. HPV status did not associate with microbial diversity. In conclusion, no association was found between urban level and the vaginal microbiome in Amerindian women, and little difference was found between ethnicities. L. iners and high diversity profiles, associated with vaginal health outcomes, prevail in these populations.

## Water management and phenology influence the root-associated rice field microbiota.

Microbial communities associated to plants are greatly influenced by water availability in soil. In flooded crops, such as rice, the impact of water management on microbial dynamics is not fully understood. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the rice microbiota investigated in an experimental field located in one of the most productive area of North Italy. The microbiota associated to paddy soil and root was investigated using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S, ITS and 18S rRNA gene amplicons under two different water managements, upland (non-flooded, aerobic) and lowland (traditional flooding, anaerobic) at three plant development stages. Results highlighted a major role of the soil water status in shaping microbial communities, while phenological stage had low impacts. Compositional shifts in prokaryotic and fungal communities upon water management consisted in significant abundances changes of Firmicutes, Methanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Sordaryomycetes, Dothideomycetes and Glomeromycotina. A vicariance in plant beneficial microbes and between saprotrophs/pathotrophs was observed between lowland and upland. Moreover, through network analysis we demonstrated different co-abundances dynamics between lowland and upland conditions with a major impact on microbial HUBs (strongly interconnected microbes) which fully shifted to aerobic microbes in the absence of flooding.

## Aerobic microbial life persists in oxic marine sediment as old as 101.5 million years.

Sparse microbial populations persist from seafloor to basement in the slowly accumulating oxic sediment of the oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre (SPG). The physiological status of these communities, including their substrate metabolism, is previously unconstrained. Here we show that diverse aerobic members of communities in SPG sediments (4.3‒101.5 Ma) are capable of readily incorporating carbon and nitrogen substrates and dividing. Most of the 6986 individual cells analyzed with nanometer-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) actively incorporated isotope-labeled substrates. Many cells responded rapidly to incubation conditions, increasing total numbers by 4 orders of magnitude and taking up labeled carbon and nitrogen within 68 days after incubation. The response was generally faster (on average, 3.09 times) for nitrogen incorporation than for carbon incorporation. In contrast, anaerobic microbes were only minimally revived from this oxic sediment. Our results suggest that microbial communities widely distributed in organic-poor abyssal sediment consist mainly of aerobes that retain their metabolic potential under extremely low-energy conditions for up to 101.5 Ma.
