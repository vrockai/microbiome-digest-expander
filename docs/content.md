## Intestinal mycobiota in health and diseases: from a disrupted equilibrium to clinical opportunities.
 18.03.2021, _X Wu, Y Xia, F He, C Zhu, W Ren_


Bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi establish a complex ecosystem in the gut. Like other microbiota, gut mycobiota plays an indispensable role in modulating intestinal physiology. Notably, the most striking characteristics of intestinal fungi are their extraintestinal functions. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the importance of gut fungi in the regulation of intestinal, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, pancreatic, and brain functions, and we present possible opportunities for the application of gut mycobiota to alleviate/treat human diseases. Video Abstract.

## Sodium houttuyfonate attenuates dextran sulfate sodium associated colitis precolonized with Candida albicans through inducing β-glucan exposure.
 08.03.2021, _K Ma, M Chen, J Liu, Y Ge, T Wang, D Wu, G Yan, C Wang, J Shao_


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is a chronic intestinal disease most likely associated with gut dysbiosis. Candida related mycobiota has been demonstrated to play a role in IBD progression. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHMs) with antifungal activity have a potential in prevention and treatment of fungi-related IBD. Sodium houttuyfonate (SH) is a promising anti-Candida TCHMs. In this study, a dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis model with Candida albicans precolonization is established. SH gavage can significantly decrease the fungal burdens in feces and colon tissues, reduce disease activity index score, elongate colon length, and attenuate colonic damages. Moreover, SH markedly inhibits the levels of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies, β-glucan, and proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α), and increases anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 level in serum and colon tissue. Further experiments demonstrate that SH could induce β-glucan exposure, priming intestinal macrophages to get rid of colonized C. albicans through the collaboration of Dectin-1 and TLR2/4. With the decreased fungal burden, the protein levels of Dectin-1, TLR2, TLR4, and NF-κBp65 are fallen back, indicating the primed macrophages calm down and the colitis is alleviated. Collectively, these results manifest that SH can attenuate C. albicans associated colitis via β-glucan exposure, deepening our understanding of TCHMs in the prevention and treatment of fungi associated IBD.

Sensing of the gut microbiota, including fungi, regulates mucosal immunity. Whether fungal sensing in the gut can influence immunity at other body sites is unknown. Here we show that fluconazole-induced gut fungal dysbiosis has persistent effects on allergic airway disease in a house dust mite challenge model. Mice with a defined community of bacteria, but lacking intestinal fungi were not susceptible to fluconazole-induced dysbiosis, while colonization with a fungal mixture recapitulated the detrimental effects. Gut-resident mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) expressing the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 were essential for the effect of gut fungal dysbiosis on peripheral immunity. Depletion of CX3CR1+ MNPs or selective inhibition of Syk signaling downstream of fungal sensing in these cells ameliorated lung allergy. These results indicate that disruption of intestinal fungal communities can have persistent effects on peripheral immunity and aggravate disease severity through fungal sensing by gut-resident CX3CR1+ MNPs.

The fungi in the gastrointestinal tract, the gut mycobiota, are now recognised as a significant part of the gut microbiota, and they may be important to human health. In contrast to the adult gut mycobiota, the establishment of the early gut mycobiota has never been described, and there is little knowledge about the fungal transfer from mother to offspring.

Fungal and bacterial commensal organisms play a complex role in the health of the human host. Expansion of commensal ecology after birth is a critical period in human immune development. However, the initial fungal colonization of the primordial gut remains undescribed. To investigate primordial fungal ecology, we performed amplicon sequencing and culture-based techniques of first-pass meconium, which forms in the intestine prior to birth, from a prospective observational cohort of term and preterm newborns. Here, we describe fungal ecologies in the primordial gut that develop complexity with advancing gestational age at birth. Our findings suggest homeostasis of fungal commensals may represent an important aspect of human biology present even before birth. Unlike bacterial communities that gradually develop complexity, the domination of the fungal communities of some preterm infants by Saccromycetes, specifically Candida, may suggest a pathologic association with preterm birth.-Willis, K.

## Investigating Colonization of the Healthy Adult Gastrointestinal Tract by Fungi.

A wide diversity of fungi have been detected in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract with the potential to provide or influence important functions. However, many of the fungi most commonly detected in stool samples are also present in food or the oral cavity. Therefore, to recognize which gut fungi are likely to have a sustained influence on human health, there is a need to separate transient members of the GI tract from true colonizers. To identify colonizing fungi, the eukaryotic rRNA operon's second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) was sequenced from the stool, saliva, and food of healthy adults following consumption of different controlled diets. Unlike most bacterial 16S rRNA genes, the only fungal ITS2 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in stool DNA across multiple diets were also present in saliva and/or food. Additional analyses, including culture-based approaches and sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene, ITS2 cDNA, and DNA extracted using alternative methods, failed to detect additional fungi. Two abundant fungi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, were examined further in healthy volunteers. Saccharomyces became undetectable in stool when a S. cerevisiae-free diet was consumed, and the levels of C. albicans in stool were dramatically reduced by more frequent cleaning of teeth. Extremely low fungal abundance, the inability of fungi to grow under conditions mimicking the distal gut, and evidence from analysis of other public datasets further support the hypothesis that fungi do not routinely colonize the GI tracts of healthy adults. IMPORTANCE We sought to identify the fungi that colonize healthy GI tracts and that have a sustained influence on the diverse functions of the gut microbiome. Instead, we found that all fungi in the stool of healthy volunteers could be explained by their presence in oral and dietary sources and that our results, together with those from other analyses, support the model that there is little or no gastrointestinal colonization by fungi. This may be due to Westernization, primate evolution, fungal ecology, and/or the strong defenses of a healthy immune system. Importantly, fungal colonization of the GI tract may often be indicative of disease. As fungi can cause serious infections in immunocompromised individuals and are found at increased abundance in multiple disorders of the GI tract, understanding normal fungal colonization is essential for proper treatment and prevention of fungal pathogenesis.

## Macrophages Maintain Epithelium Integrity by Limiting Fungal Product Absorption.

The colon is primarily responsible for absorbing fluids. It contains a large number of microorganisms including fungi, which are enriched in its distal segment. The colonic mucosa must therefore tightly regulate fluid influx to control absorption of fungal metabolites, which can be toxic to epithelial cells and lead to barrier dysfunction. How this is achieved remains unknown. Here, we describe a mechanism by which the innate immune system allows rapid quality check of absorbed fluids to avoid intoxication of colonocytes. This mechanism relies on a population of distal colon macrophages that are equipped with "balloon-like" protrusions (BLPs) inserted in the epithelium, which sample absorbed fluids. In the absence of macrophages or BLPs, epithelial cells keep absorbing fluids containing fungal products, leading to their death and subsequent loss of epithelial barrier integrity. These results reveal an unexpected and essential role of macrophages in the maintenance of colon-microbiota interactions in homeostasis. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

## Fungal Symbionts Produce Prostaglandin E2 to Promote Their Intestinal Colonization.

Candida albicans is a ubiquitous fungal symbiont that resides on diverse human barrier surfaces. Both mammalian and fungal cells can convert arachidonic acid into the lipid mediator, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), but the physiological significance of fungus-derived PGE2 remains elusive. Here we report that a C. albicans mutant deficient in PGE2 production suffered a loss of competitive fitness in the murine gastrointestinal (GI) tract and that PGE2 supplementation mitigated this fitness defect. Impaired fungal PGE2 production affected neither the in vitro fitness of C. albicans nor hyphal morphogenesis and virulence in either systemic or mucosal infection models. Instead, fungal production of PGE2 was associated with enhanced fungal survival within phagocytes. Consequently, ablation of colonic phagocytes abrogated the intra-GI fitness boost conferred by fungal PGE2. These observations suggest that C. albicans has evolved the capacity to produce PGE2 from arachidonic acid, a host-derived precursor, to promote its own colonization of the host gut. Analogous mechanisms might undergird host-microbe interactions of other symbiont fungi.

## Gut mycobiome: The probable determinative role of fungi in IBD patients.
 04.02.2021, _A Beheshti-Maal, S Shahrokh, S Ansari, ES Mirsamadi, A Yadegar, H Mirjalali, MR Zali_


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multi-factorial autoimmune disorder that its causative agents are unknown. The gut microbiota comprises of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa that its role in IBD has remained controversially. Bacteria constitute more than 99% of the gut microbiota composition, and the main core of the gut microbiota is composed from Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The gut microbiota plays an important role in training, development and haemostasis of the immune responses during the life. Fungi compose a very small portion of gut microbiota, but play determinative roles in homeostasis of the gut bacterial composition and the mucosal immune responses. An interkingdom correlation between bacteria and fungi has been suggested. For example, the presence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium reduces the viability and colonisation of C albicans. Alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiota, which is known as dysbiosis, are a usual event in patients who suffer from IBD. Although the main reason for this alteration is not clear, the interaction between gut bacteria and gut fungi seems to be an important subject in IBD patients. This review covers new findings on the interaction between fungi and bacteria and the role of fungi in the pathophysiology of IBD.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by alterations in the intestinal microbiota and altered immune responses to gut microbiota. Evidence is accumulating that IBD is influenced by not only commensal bacteria but also commensal fungi. We characterized fungi directly associated with the intestinal mucosa in healthy people and Crohn's disease patients and identified fungi specifically abundant in patients. One of these, the common skin resident fungus Malassezia restricta, is also linked to the presence of an IBD-associated polymorphism in the gene for CARD9, a signaling adaptor important for anti-fungal defense. M. restricta elicits innate inflammatory responses largely through CARD9 and is recognized by Crohn's disease patient anti-fungal antibodies. This yeast elicits strong inflammatory cytokine production from innate cells harboring the IBD-linked polymorphism in CARD9 and exacerbates colitis via CARD9 in mouse models of disease. Collectively, these results suggest that targeting specific commensal fungi may be a therapeutic strategy for IBD.

We studied levels of S100A8-A9 in fecal samples (also called fecal calprotectin) from newborns and during infancy, and their effects on development of the intestinal microbiota and mucosal immune system.

## Contribution of the Intestinal Microbiome and Gut Barrier to Hepatic Disorders.
 15.11.2020, _DM Chopyk, A Grakoui_


Intestinal barrier dysfunction and dysbiosis contribute to development of diseases in liver and other organs. Physical, immunologic, and microbiologic (bacterial, fungal, archaeal, viral, and protozoal) features of the intestine separate its nearly 100 trillion microbes from the rest of the human body. Failure of any aspect of this barrier can result in translocation of microbes into the blood and sustained inflammatory response that promote liver injury, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and oncogenic transformation. Alterations in intestinal microbial populations or their functions can also affect health. We review the mechanisms that regulate intestinal permeability and how changes in the intestinal microbiome contribute to development of acute and chronic liver diseases. We discuss individual components of the intestinal barrier and how these are disrupted during development of different liver diseases. Learning more about these processes will increase our understanding of the interactions among the liver, intestine, and its flora.

## The gut mycobiome of healthy mice is shaped by the environment and correlates with metabolic outcomes in response to diet.
 10.03.2021, _TS Mims, QA Abdallah, JD Stewart, SP Watts, CT White, TV Rousselle, A Gosain, A Bajwa, JC Han, KA Willis, JF Pierre_


As an active interface between the host and their diet, the gut microbiota influences host metabolic adaptation; however, the contributions of fungi have been overlooked. Here, we investigate whether variations in gut mycobiome abundance and composition correlate with key features of host metabolism. We obtained animals from four commercial sources in parallel to test if differing starting mycobiomes can shape host adaptation in response to processed diets. We show that the gut mycobiome of healthy mice is shaped by the environment, including diet, and significantly correlates with metabolic outcomes. We demonstrate that exposure to processed diet leads to persistent differences in fungal communities that significantly associate with differential deposition of body mass in male mice compared to mice fed standardized diet. Fat deposition in the liver, transcriptional adaptation of metabolically active tissues and serum metabolic biomarker levels are linked with alterations in fungal community diversity and composition. Specifically, variation in fungi from the genera Thermomyces and Saccharomyces most strongly associate with metabolic disturbance and weight gain. These data suggest that host-microbe metabolic interactions may be influenced by variability in the mycobiome. This work highlights the potential significance of the gut mycobiome in health and has implications for human and experimental metabolic studies.

Recent studies highlight that the gut mycobiota play essential roles in mammalian metabolic and immune systems, but to date we lack information on the forces that naturally shape the gut mycobiota of wild primates. To investigate the contributions of host and environmental factors in the taxonomic variation of the gut mycobiota, we examined the effects of age, sex, and season on the fecal mycobiota in wild-living Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana). Using next generation sequencing and a longitudinal set of fecal samples collected over 1 year, we identified a set of core fungal taxa present in the Tibetan macaque's fecal samples. The predominant genera Aspergillus and Penicillium, which promote the digestion of cellulose and hemicellulose in herbivorous mammals, were detected in this study. Similar to humans, we found age and sex effects on the macaques' fecal mycobiota. We also found that both fecal fungal composition and diversity (alpha and beta diversity) varied significantly by season. In particular, the Penicillium enriched mycobiota in summer samples may aid in the digestion of cellulose and hemicellulose present in mature leaves. The high alpha diversity detected in Tibetan macaques' winter fecal samples may facilitate a diet rich in fiber ingested during this season. We propose that the gut mycobiota play an important role in the macaques' ability to adapt to seasonal fluctuations in food availability and nutrient content.

Free-living mammals, such as humans and wild mice, display heightened immune activation compared with artificially maintained laboratory mice. These differences are partially attributed to microbial exposure as laboratory mice infected with pathogens exhibit immune profiles more closely resembling that of free-living animals. Here, we examine how colonization by microorganisms within the natural environment contributes to immune system maturation by releasing inbred laboratory mice into an outdoor enclosure. In addition to enhancing differentiation of T cell populations previously associated with pathogen exposure, outdoor release increased circulating granulocytes. However, these "rewilded" mice were not infected by pathogens previously implicated in immune activation. Rather, immune system changes were associated with altered microbiota composition with notable increases in intestinal fungi. Fungi isolated from rewilded mice were sufficient in increasing circulating granulocytes. These findings establish a model to investigate how the natural environment impacts immune development and show that sustained fungal exposure impacts granulocyte numbers.

Metagenomics is revolutionizing the study of microorganisms and their involvement in biological, biomedical, and geochemical processes, allowing us to investigate by direct sequencing a tremendous diversity of organisms without the need for prior cultivation. Unicellular eukaryotes play essential roles in most microbial communities as chief predators, decomposers, phototrophs, bacterial hosts, symbionts, and parasites to plants and animals. Investigating their roles is therefore of great interest to ecology, biotechnology, human health, and evolution. However, the generally lower sequencing coverage, their more complex gene and genome architectures, and a lack of eukaryote-specific experimental and computational procedures have kept them on the sidelines of metagenomics.

Microbial eukaryotes are found alongside bacteria and archaea in natural microbial systems, including host-associated microbiomes. While microbial eukaryotes are critical to these communities, they are challenging to study with shotgun sequencing techniques and are therefore often excluded.
