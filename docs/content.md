Italy was one of the first European countries affected by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with over 105,000 infected people and close to 13,000 deaths, until March 31st. The pandemic has hit especially hard because of the country's demographic structure, with a high percentage of older adults. The authors explore the possibility, recently aired in some studies, of extensive intergenerational contact as a possible determinant of the severity of the pandemic among the older Italian adults. We analyzed several variables to test this hypothesis, such as the percentage of infected patients aged &gt;80 years, available nursing home beds, COVID-19 incidence rate, and the number of days from when the number of positive tests exceeded 50 (epidemic maturity). We also included in the analysis mean household size and percentage of households comprising one person, in the region. Paradoxically, the results are opposite of what was previously reported. The pandemic was more severe in regions with higher family fragmentation and increased availability of residential health facilities.

When microorganisms are exposed to lethal agents, the initial exponential decay in survival is typically followed by a slower decrease. This tailing of the survival curve is due to persister cells that have differentiated into phenotypes with reduced sensitivity to the lethal agent. We review the environmental factors that have been shown to trigger such differentiation processes, as well as the network motifs that enable the co-existence of persistent and nonpersistent cells within genetically uniform populations. Threshold amplification of noise and bi-stability from positive feedback emerge as key motifs underlying persistence.

## Response to letter: Non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants may not significantly reduce the risk of fatal or disabling stroke compared to warfarin.

We agree with Zheng and colleagues that a statistical measure of heterogeneity is an important consideration in selecting a fixed or random effects model. However, it should not be considered the sole criterion. In meta-analyses that include small numbers of trials, such as ours, results of tests for heterogeneity should be interpreted with caution, as they may be underpowered. A fixed effects model has been advocated when meta-analysing small number of studies (less than five trials), given the concern about inaccurate estimation of between-study variance (1), as the estimation of τ2 (between-study variance), and therefore of μ (estimate of underlying mean effect), is highly imprecise (2).

## Fecal microbiota transplantation in systemic sclerosis: A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized pilot trial.

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an auto-immune, multi organ disease marked by severe gastrointestinal (GI) involvement and gut dysbiosis. Here, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using commercially-available anaerobic cultivated human intestinal microbiota (ACHIM) in SSc.

## A high-fat diet induces a microbiota-dependent increase in stem cell activity in the Drosophila intestine.
 26.05.2020, _J von Frieling, MN Faisal, F Sporn, R Pfefferkorn, SS Nolte, F Sommer, P Rosenstiel, T Roeder_


Over-consumption of high-fat diets (HFDs) is associated with several pathologies. Although the intestine is the organ that comes into direct contact with all diet components, the impact of HFD has mostly been studied in organs that are linked to obesity and obesity related disorders. We used Drosophila as a simple model to disentangle the effects of a HFD on the intestinal structure and physiology from the plethora of other effects caused by this nutritional intervention. Here, we show that a HFD, composed of triglycerides with saturated fatty acids, triggers activation of intestinal stem cells in the Drosophila midgut. This stem cell activation was transient and dependent on the presence of an intestinal microbiota, as it was completely absent in germ free animals. Moreover, major components of the signal transduction pathway have been elucidated. Here, JNK (basket) in enterocytes was necessary to trigger synthesis of the cytokine upd3 in these cells. This ligand in turn activated the JAK/STAT pathway in intestinal stem cells. Chronic subjection to a HFD markedly altered both the microbiota composition and the bacterial load. Although HFD-induced stem cell activity was transient, long-lasting changes to the cellular composition, including a substantial increase in the number of enteroendocrine cells, were observed. Taken together, a HFD enhances stem cell activity in the Drosophila gut and this effect is completely reliant on the indigenous microbiota and also dependent on JNK signaling within intestinal enterocytes.

## The cecal and fecal microbiomes and metabolomes of horses before and after metronidazole administration.

Antibiotic administration can be a cause of gastrointestinal disease in horses, creating a disruption in the normal population and function of bacteria found in the hindgut. The objective of this study was to describe the changes in the cecal and fecal microbiomes and metabolomes of clinically healthy horses before and after metronidazole administration. Metronidazole (15 mg/kg BID PO) was given to five horses with cecal cannulas. The study was suspended on Day 3 due to adverse gastrointestinal effects. Cecal and fecal samples were obtained before (Days minus52, m28, m14, and 0) and after (Days 7, 14, 28, and 52) metronidazole administration. DNA was extracted from the cecal and fecal samples, and 16S rRNA genes were sequenced. Richness and evenness indices were significantly decreased by metronidazole administration in both cecal and fecal samples, but the overall composition was only significantly changed in fecal samples on Day 3 (ANOSIM, p = 0.008). The most dominant phyla were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in all groups examined. In fecal samples, significant changes of the phyla Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, Lentisphaerae, and Verrucomicrobia occurred on Day 3, which correlated with clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. The metabolome was characterized by mass spectrometry-based methods and only named metabolites were included in the analysis. Fecal, but not cecal, metabolites were significantly affected by metronidazole. The fecal metabolites affected represent diverse metabolic pathways, such as the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids and cofactors and vitamins. Metronidazole administration has potential to cause adverse effects in horses, alters the bacterial composition of the horse's cecal and fecal content, and the metabolome of fecal samples.
