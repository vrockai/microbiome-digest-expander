 22.04.2020, _JM Mehnert, E Bergsland, BH O'Neil, A Santoro, JHM Schellens, RB Cohen, T Doi, PA Ott, MJ Pishvaian, I Puzanov, KL Aung, C Hsu, C Le Tourneau, A Hollebecque, E Élez, K Tamura, M Gould, P Yang, K Stein, SA Piha-Paul_


Despite a protracted disease course and multiple available therapies, patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) inevitably experience disease progression. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has been associated with NET progression and prognosis. The multicohort, phase 1 KEYNOTE-028 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02054806) evaluated the activity and safety of the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab in patients with well-differentiated or moderately-differentiated NETs.

## Genetic and metabolic links between the murine microbiome and memory.
 23.04.2020, _JH Mao, YM Kim, YX Zhou, D Hu, C Zhong, H Chang, C Brislawn, S Langley, Y Wang, BYL Peisl, SE Celniker, DW Threadgill, P Wilmes, G Orr, TO Metz, JK Jansson, AM Snijders_


Recent evidence has linked the gut microbiome to host behavior via the gut-brain axis [1-3]; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. Here, we determined the links between host genetics, the gut microbiome and memory using the genetically defined Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse cohort, complemented with microbiome and metabolomic analyses in conventional and germ-free (GF) mice.

## Combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing of respiratory samples: Does the DNA extraction method matter?
 28.04.2020, _C Angebault, M Payen, PL Woerther, C Rodriguez, F Botterel_


High-throughput sequencing techniques are used to analyse the diversity of the respiratory microbiota in health and disease. Although extensive data are available regarding bacterial respiratory microbiota, its fungal component remains poorly studied. This is partly due to the technical issues associated with fungal metagenomics analyses. In this study, we compared two DNA extraction protocols and two fungal amplification targets for combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing analyses of the respiratory microbiota.

## Oral Microbiome Profiling in Smokers with and without Head and Neck Cancer Reveals Variations Between Health and Disease.
 21.04.2020, _AK Sharma, WT DeBusk, I Stepanov, A Gomez, SS Khariwala_


While smoking is inextricably linked to oral/head and neck cancer (HNSCC), only a small fraction of smokers develop HNSCC. Thus, we have sought to identify other factors, which may influence the development of HNSCC in smokers including microbiology. To determine microbial associations with HNSCC among tobacco users, we characterized oral microbiome composition in smokers with and without HNSCC. 16S rRNA MiSeq sequencing was used to examine the oral mucosa microbiome of 27 smokers with (cases) and 24 without HNSCC (controls). In addition, we correlated previously reported levels of DNA damage with the microbiome data. Smokers with HNSCC showed lower microbiome richness compared with controls (q = 0.012). Beta-diversity analyses, assessed as UniFrac (weighted and unweighted) and Bray-Curtis distances, showed significant differences in oral mucosal microbiome signatures between cases and controls (r2 = 0.03; P = 0.03) and higher interindividual microbiome heterogeneity in the former (q ≤ 0.01). Higher relative abundance of Stenotrophomonas and Comamonadaceae and predicted bacterial pathways mainly involved in xenobiotic and amine degradation were found in cases compared with controls. The latter, in contrast, exhibited higher abundance of common oral commensals and predicted sugar degradation pathways. Finally, levels of DNA damage in the oral cavity were correlated with the microbiome profiles above. Oral microbiome traits differ in smokers with and without HNSCC, potentially informing the risk of eventual HNSCC and shedding light into possible microbially mediated mechanisms of disease. These findings present data that may be useful in screening efforts for HNSCC among smokers who are unable to quit.

## The responses of soil bacterial communities and enzyme activities to the edaphic properties of coal mining areas in Central China.
 28.04.2020, _J Sun, L Yang, J Wei, J Quan, X Yang_


Soil physicochemical properties, bacterial communities and enzyme activities change with land subsidence resulting from coal mining. However, research on the responses of bacterial communities and enzyme activities to the soil properties in different degree of subsidence areas is limited. As such, we collected soil samples from a control area (C area), a moderate mining subsidence area (M area) and a severe mining subsidence area (S area) in Central China. Soil properties, such as the pH, total nitrogen (TN) content, total phosphorus (TP) content, available phosphorus (AP) content, organic matter (OM) content, and soil enzyme (urease, invertase, catalase and alkaline phosphatase) activities were measured in each sampling area at depths of 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm. The results indicated that the soil physiochemical properties, soil urease activity, soil alkaline phosphatase activity and soil bacterial richness and diversity in the topsoil (0-20 cm) of the mining subsidence area were significantly lower than those in the C area. However, the soil enzyme activities within the deepest layer of the subsidence area were significantly greater than those of the C area. The bacterial communities within the depth of 0-20 cm were dominated by RB41, Pseudomonas, MND1, Nitrospira, Trichococcus, Sphingomonas and Dongia, whereas RB41 and Pseudomonas were the dominant species in the C area and subsidence area, respectively. Using correlation analysis, we found that the soil pH value, soil AP content and activities of the four enzymes were the main factors affecting the soil bacterial community structure. In addition, the soil nutrient contents, enzyme activities and bacterial richness and evenness decreased with increasing subsidence degree (classified by geological hazards, groundwater and landscape damage degree of coal mining subsidence). These results provide a reliable basis for environmental management of mining areas.

## Crewmember microbiome may influence microbial composition of ISS habitable surfaces.
 29.04.2020, _A Avila-Herrera, J Thissen, C Urbaniak, NA Be, DJ Smith, F Karouia, S Mehta, K Venkateswaran, C Jaing_


The International Space Station (ISS) is a complex built environment physically isolated from Earth. Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term human spaceflight missions. In this study, we describe one crewmember's microbial profile from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, skin and saliva that were collected at eight different time points pre-, during and post-flight. Additionally, environmental surface samples from eight different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. Environmental samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and samples from the next flight were collected after the crewmember departed. The microbial composition in both environment and crewmember samples was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and processed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember's skin samples are more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. In these collections, species alpha diversity in saliva samples appears to decrease during flight and rebound after returning to Earth. This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a crewmember's microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We observed that the microbiome of the surfaces inside the ISS resemble those of the crew's skin. These data support future crew and ISS microbial surveillance efforts and the design of preventive measures to maintain crew habitat onboard spacecraft destined for long term space travel.

## Structure and conformational cycle of a bacteriophage-encoded chaperonin.
 27.04.2020, _A Bracher, SS Paul, H Wang, N Wischnewski, FU Hartl, M Hayer-Hartl_


Chaperonins are ubiquitous molecular chaperones found in all domains of life. They form ring-shaped complexes that assist in the folding of substrate proteins in an ATP-dependent reaction cycle. Key to the folding cycle is the transient encapsulation of substrate proteins by the chaperonin. Here we present a structural and functional characterization of the chaperonin gp146 (ɸEL) from the phage EL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ɸEL, an evolutionarily distant homolog of bacterial GroEL, is active in ATP hydrolysis and prevents the aggregation of denatured protein in a nucleotide-dependent manner. However, ɸEL failed to refold the encapsulation-dependent model substrate rhodanese and did not interact with E. coli GroES, the lid-shaped co-chaperone of GroEL. ɸEL forms tetradecameric double-ring complexes, which dissociate into single rings in the presence of ATP. Crystal structures of ɸEL (at 3.54 and 4.03 Å) in presence of ATP•BeFx revealed two distinct single-ring conformational states, both with open access to the ring cavity. One state showed uniform ATP-bound subunit conformations (symmetric state), whereas the second combined distinct ATP- and ADP-bound subunit conformations (asymmetric state). Cryo-electron microscopy of apo-ɸEL revealed a double-ring structure composed of rings in the asymmetric state (3.45 Å resolution). We propose that the phage chaperonin undergoes nucleotide-dependent conformational switching between double- and single rings and functions in aggregation prevention without substrate protein encapsulation. Thus, ɸEL may represent an evolutionarily more ancient chaperonin prior to acquisition of the encapsulation mechanism.
