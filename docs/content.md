## Circulating microbiome DNA: An emerging paradigm for cancer liquid biopsy.
 30.08.2021, _H Chen, Y Ma, Z Liu, J Li, X Li, F Yang, M Qiu_


Dysbiosis of the human microbiome has long been reported to be closely associated with various cancers. Accumulating studies have shown that microbial dysbiosis can accelerate tumorigenesis through tumor-promoting inflammation, DNA damage, and inducing immune evasion. Differential composition of microbiome could be novel biomarkers for cancer detection or biomarkers of successful immunotherapy. More importantly, emerging evidence demonstrates that alterations of circulating microbiome DNA (cmDNA) could serve as promising noninvasive biomarkers for cancer detection. It has been reported that distinct circulating bacterial DNA could distinguish prostate cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma patients from healthy populations. Therefore, in this review, we summarized current literature on microbial biomarkers for cancer detection and unraveled the potential of cmDNA as a promising cancer detection tool.

## Human-associated microbiota suppress invading bacteria even under disruption by antibiotics.
 30.08.2021, _AD Letten, M Baumgartner, KR Pfrunder-Cardozo, JM Levine, AR Hall_


In light of their adverse impacts on resident microbial communities, it is widely predicted that broad-spectrum antibiotics can promote the spread of resistance by releasing resistant strains from competition with other strains and species. We investigated the competitive suppression of a resistant strain of Escherichia coli inoculated into human-associated communities in the presence and absence of the broad and narrow spectrum antibiotics rifampicin and polymyxin B, respectively. We found strong evidence of community-level suppression of the resistant strain in the absence of antibiotics and, despite large changes in community composition and abundance following rifampicin exposure, suppression of the invading resistant strain was maintained in both antibiotic treatments. Instead, the strength of competitive suppression was more strongly associated with the source community (stool sample from individual human donor). This suggests microbiome composition strongly influences the competitive suppression of antibiotic-resistant strains, but at least some antibiotic-associated disruption can be tolerated before competitive release is observed. A deeper understanding of this association will aid the development of ecologically-aware strategies for managing antibiotic resistance.

## Crosstalk between γδ T cells and the microbiota.
 26.08.2021, _PH Papotto, B Yilmaz, B Silva-Santos_


The role of the microbiota in the development and function of γδ T cells-a T cell subset characterized by a T cell receptor composed of one γ-chain and one δ-chain-has been investigated in multiple organs in mice and humans. Interactions between the microbiota and γδ T cells affect both tissue homeostasis and disease pathologies. Notably, microbiota-induced interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing-γδ T cells can mediate a range of immunological processes, from metabolic disorders to neuroinflammation via the gut-brain axis. However, the bidirectional interactions between γδ T cells and the microbiota have not been fully determined. In this Perspective, we dissect the roles of microbiota in modulating γδ T cell development and function, and evaluate the evidence for γδ T cell selection of commensal communities. We also discuss the potential implications of these cells in health and disease and the major open questions and research avenues in the field.

## Key bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways affecting gut short-chain fatty acid profiles in early life.
 30.08.2021, _N Tsukuda, K Yahagi, T Hara, Y Watanabe, H Matsumoto, H Mori, K Higashi, H Tsuji, S Matsumoto, K Kurokawa, T Matsuki_


Infant gut microbiota development affects the host physiology throughout life, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are promising key metabolites mediating microbiota-host relationships. Here, we investigated dense longitudinally collected faecal samples from 12 subjects during the first 2 years (n = 1048) to identify early life gut SCFA patterns and their relationships with the microbiota. Our results revealed three distinct phases of progression in the SCFA profiles: early phase characterised by low acetate and high succinate, middle-phase characterised by high lactate and formate and late-phase characterised by high propionate and butyrate. Assessment of the SCFA-microbiota relationships revealed that faecal butyrate is associated with increased Clostridiales and breastfeeding cessation, and that diverse and personalised assemblage of Clostridiales species possessing the acetyl-CoA pathway play major roles in gut butyrate production. We also found an association between gut formate and some infant-type bifidobacterial species, and that human milk oligosaccharides (HMO)-derived fucose is the substrate for formate production during breastfeeding. We identified genes upregulated in fucose and fucosylated HMO utilisation in infant-type bifidobacteria. Notably, bifidobacteria showed interspecific and intraspecific variation in the gene repertoires, and cross-feeding of fucose contributed to gut formate production. This study provides an insight into early life SCFA-microbiota relationships, which is an important step for developing strategies for modulating lifelong health.

## Association between metabolic syndrome and periodontitis: The role of lipids, inflammatory cytokines, altered host response, and the microbiome.
 01.09.2021, _FQ Pirih, S Monajemzadeh, N Singh, RS Sinacola, JM Shin, T Chen, JC Fenno, P Kamarajan, AH Rickard, S Travan, BJ Paster, Y Kapila_


Periodontitis has been associated with many systemic diseases and conditions, including metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that occur concomitantly and together they increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and double the risk of type 2 diabetes. In this review, we focus on the association between metabolic syndrome and periodontitis; however, we also include information on diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, since these two conditions are significantly intertwined with metabolic syndrome. With regard to periodontitis and metabolic syndrome, to date, the vast majority of studies point to an association between these two conditions and also demonstrate that periodontitis can contribute to the development of, or can worsen, metabolic syndrome. Evaluating the effect of metabolic syndrome on the salivary microbiome, data presented herein support the hypothesis that the salivary bacterial profile is altered in metabolic syndrome patients compared with healthy patients. Considering periodontitis and these three conditions, the vast majority of human and animal studies point to an association between periodontitis and metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that metabolic syndrome and diabetes can alter the oral microbiome. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the influence these conditions have on each other.

## Fungal diseases: Oral dysbiosis in susceptible hosts.
 01.09.2021, _CC Villar, A Dongari-Bagtzoglou_


The oral cavity is colonized by a large number of microorganisms that are referred to collectively as the oral microbiota. These indigenous microorganisms have evolved in symbiotic relationships with the oral mucosal immune system and are involved in maintaining homeostasis in the oral cavity. Although Candida species are commonly found in the healthy oral cavity without causing infection, these fungi can become pathogenic. Recents advances indicate that the development of oral candidiasis is driven both by Candida albicans overgrowth in a dysbiotic microbiome and by disturbances in the host's immune system. Perturbation of the oral microbiota triggered by host-extrinsic (ie, medications), host-intrinsic (ie, host genetics), and microbiome-intrinsic (ie, microbial interactions) factors may increase the risk of oral candidiasis. In this review, we provide an overview of the oral mycobiome, with a particular focus on the interactions of Candida albicans with some of the most common oral bacteria and the oral mucosal immune system. Also, we present a summary of our current knowledge of the host-intrinsic and host-extrinsic factors that can predispose to oral candidiasis.

## The oral microbiome: Role of key organisms and complex networks in oral health and disease.
 01.09.2021, _L Sedghi, V DiMassa, A Harrington, SV Lynch, YL Kapila_


States of oral health and disease reflect the compositional and functional capacities of, as well as the interspecies interactions within, the oral microbiota. The oral cavity exists as a highly dynamic microbial environment that harbors many distinct substrata and microenvironments that house diverse microbial communities. Specific to the oral cavity, the nonshedding dental surfaces facilitate the development of highly complex polymicrobial biofilm communities, characterized not only by the distinct microbes comprising them, but cumulatively by their activities. Adding to this complexity, the oral cavity faces near-constant environmental challenges, including those from host diet, salivary flow, masticatory forces, and introduction of exogenous microbes. The composition of the oral microbiome is shaped throughout life by factors including host genetics, maternal transmission, as well as environmental factors, such as dietary habits, oral hygiene practice, medications, and systemic factors. This dynamic ecosystem presents opportunities for oral microbial dysbiosis and the development of dental and periodontal diseases. The application of both in vitro and culture-independent approaches has broadened the mechanistic understandings of complex polymicrobial communities within the oral cavity, as well as the environmental, local, and systemic underpinnings that influence the dynamics of the oral microbiome. Here, we review the present knowledge and current understanding of microbial communities within the oral cavity and the influences and challenges upon this system that encourage homeostasis or provoke microbiome perturbation, and thus contribute to states of oral health or disease.

## Human reference gut microbiome catalog including newly assembled genomes from under-represented Asian metagenomes.
 31.08.2021, _CY Kim, M Lee, S Yang, K Kim, D Yong, HR Kim, I Lee_


Metagenome sampling bias for geographical location and lifestyle is partially responsible for the incomplete catalog of reference genomes of gut microbial species. Thus, genome assembly from currently under-represented populations may effectively expand the reference gut microbiome and improve taxonomic and functional profiling.

## The promise of the gut microbiome as part of individualized treatment strategies.
 28.08.2021, _DA Schupack, RAT Mars, DH Voelker, JP Abeykoon, PC Kashyap_


Variability in disease presentation, progression and treatment response has been a central challenge in medicine. Although variability in host factors and genetics are important, it has become evident that the gut microbiome, with its vast genetic and metabolic diversity, must be considered in moving towards individualized treatment. In this Review, we discuss six broad disease groups: infectious disease, cancer, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune or inflammatory disease, and allergic and atopic diseases. We highlight current knowledge on the gut microbiome in disease pathogenesis and prognosis, efficacy, and treatment-related adverse events and its promise for stratifying existing treatments and as a source of novel therapies. The Review is not meant to be comprehensive for each disease state but rather highlights the potential implications of the microbiome as a tool to individualize treatment strategies in clinical practice. Although early, the outlook is optimistic but challenges need to be overcome before clinical implementation, including improved understanding of underlying mechanisms, longitudinal studies with multiple data layers reflecting gut microbiome and host response, standardized approaches to testing and reporting, and validation in larger cohorts. Given progress in the microbiome field with concurrent basic and clinical studies, the microbiome will likely become an integral part of clinical care within the next decade.

## The gut microbiome and efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.
 28.08.2021, _G Roviello, LF Iannone, M Bersanelli, E Mini, M Catalano_


Cancer treatment has been deeply changed by immunotherapy, achieving unprecedented improvement in overall and progression-free survival in several advanced and metastatic cancers. Currently, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) antibodies against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA-4) and programmed death/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) are being tested and approved for different tumors, ranging from melanoma to lung carcinoma. However, only a subgroup of patients can reach treatment benefits and long-term responses, and reliable biomarkers that can accurately predict clinical responses to immunotherapy are still unidentified. In the last decade, accumulating evidence seems to suggest the gut microbiota as one of the modulators that can alter the efficacy and toxicity of immunotherapy drugs (as well as chemotherapeutics), mainly acting through the local and systemic immune system. Herein, we reviewed the highly dynamic and complex microbiome-immune system interface, its bidirectional relationship with cancer immunotherapies, and explored the future possibilities and risks in manipulating the gut microbiome.

## Longitudinal study on the effects of growth-promoting and therapeutic antibiotics on the dynamics of chicken cloacal and litter microbiomes and resistomes.
 29.08.2021, _CL Gupta, SE Blum, K Kattusamy, T Daniel, S Druyan, R Shapira, O Krifucks, YG Zhu, XY Zhou, JQ Su, E Cytryn_


Therapeutic and growth-promoting antibiotics are frequently used in broiler production. Indirect evidence indicates that these practices are linked to the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from food animals to humans, and the environment, but there is a lack of comprehensive experimental data supporting this. We investigated the effects of growth promotor (bacitracin) and therapeutic (enrofloxacin) antibiotic administration on AMR in broilers for the duration of a production cycle, using a holistic approach that integrated both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. We specifically focused on pathogen-harboring families (Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae, and Staphylococcaceae).

## Social networks strongly predict the gut microbiota of wild mice.
 30.08.2021, _A Raulo, BE Allen, T Troitsky, A Husby, JA Firth, T Coulson, SCL Knowles_


The mammalian gut teems with microbes, yet how hosts acquire these symbionts remains poorly understood. Research in primates suggests that microbes can be picked up via social contact, but the role of social interactions in non-group-living species remains underexplored. Here, we use a passive tracking system to collect high resolution spatiotemporal activity data from wild mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Social network analysis revealed social association strength to be the strongest predictor of microbiota similarity among individuals, controlling for factors including spatial proximity and kinship, which had far smaller or nonsignificant effects. This social effect was limited to interactions involving males (male-male and male-female), implicating sex-dependent behaviours as driving processes. Social network position also predicted microbiota richness, with well-connected individuals having the most diverse microbiotas. Overall, these findings suggest social contact provides a key transmission pathway for gut symbionts even in relatively asocial mammals, that strongly shapes the adult gut microbiota. This work underlines the potential for individuals to pick up beneficial symbionts as well as pathogens from social interactions.
