Iron and steel industries are the major contributors to persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The microbial community present at such sites has the potential to remediate these contaminants. The present study highlights the metabolic potential of the resident bacterial community of PAHs and PCB contaminated soil nearby Bhilai steel plant, Chhattisgarh (India). The GC-MS/MS analysis of soil samples MGB-2 (sludge) and MGB-3 (dry soil) resulted in identification of different classes of POPs including PAHs {benzo[a]anthracene (nd; 17.69%), fluorene (15.89%, nd), pyrene (nd; 18.7%), benzo(b)fluoranthene (3.03%, nd), benzo(k)fluoranthene (11.29%; nd), perylene (5.23%; nd)} and PCBs (PCB-15, PCB-95, and PCB-136). Whole-genome metagenomic analysis by Oxford Nanopore GridION Technology revealed predominance of domain bacteria (97.4%; 97.5%) followed by eukaryote (1.4%; 1.5%), archaea (1.2%; 0.9%) and virus (0.02%; 0.04%) in MGB-2 and MGB-3 respectively. Proteobacteria (44.3%; 50.0%) to be the prominent phylum followed by Actinobacteria (22.1%; 19.5%) in MBG-2 and MBG-3, respectively. However, Eukaryota microbial communities showed a predominance of phylum Ascomycota (20.5%; 23.6%), Streptophyta (18.5%, 17.0%) and unclassified (derived from Eukaryota) (12.1%; 12.2%) in MGB-2 and MGB-3. The sample MGB-3 was richer in macronutrients (C, N, P), supporting high microbial diversity than MGB-2. The presence of reads for biphenyl degradation, dioxin degradation, PAH degradation pathways can be further correlated with the presence of PCB and PAH as detected in the MGB-2 and MGB-3 samples. Further, taxonomic vis-Ã -vis functional analysis identified Burkholderia, Bradyrhizobium, Mycobacterium, and Rhodopseudomonas as the keystone degrader of PAH and PCB. Overall, our results revealed the importance of metagenomic and physicochemical analysis of the contaminated site, which improves the understanding of metabolic potential and adaptation of bacteria growing under POP contaminated environments.

## Sole and combined effect of foliar zinc and arbuscular mycorrhizae inoculation on basmati rice growth, productivity and grains nutrient.

Mismanagement in foliar fertilizer application at different crop stages decreases the productivity of the crop. Likewise, higher application of phosphorus (P) beyond recommended application rates not only decrease zinc (Zn) uptake in rice but also increase fertilizer use cost. Inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AMF) may optimize the uptake of P and improve crops production via organic secretions. That's why the current study was conducted to examine the individual and coordinated effects of 0.5% Zn (0.5Zn) foliar spray (tillering (T) and/or panicle (P) initiation stage) and AMF application. Application of foliar 0.5Zn at tillering+panicle stage remained significantly better for significant enhancement in plant height, spike length, gas exchange attributes and total chlorophyll contents than control. A significant decrease in electrolyte leakage Also validated the effectiveness of treatment 0.5ZnT+P compared to control. Compared to control, the maximum increase in N (14.5 and 25.7%), P (42.1 and 33.3%), K (22.2 and 30.0%) and Zn (19.3 and 27.8%) accumulation was also found in 0.5ZnT+P, with and without AMF, respectively. In conclusion, 0.5ZnT+P with AMF is a better approach than sole application of Zn at tillering or panicle initiation stages. Nevertheless, more investigations are suggested at field level under variable climatic zones to confirm the effectiveness of 0.5ZnT+P with AMF for improvement in rice growth and production.

Foodborne diseases have become a serious havoc, where antimicrobial resistance is throwing significant challenges on daily basis. With the increase of drug-resistant bacteria and food-borne infection associated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, new and effective strategies were needed to control the emergence of vibriosis. Lytic bacteriophages come up as a promising way to resist the pathogenic population in various applications. In this study, a V. parahaemolyticus specific phage vB_VpS_PG28 was isolated from sewage in the seafood market. Results showed vB_VpS_PG28, is strictly a lytic bacteriophage and has a relatively large burst size of 103 plaque-forming units per infected cell. Comparative genomic and bioinformatic analyses proved that vB_VpS_PG28 is a new bacteriophage that had a homologous relation with Vibrio phages of family Siphoviridae, especially with phage VH2_2019, but transmission electron microscopy of vB_VpS_PG28 morphology characterized its morphology is similar to that of Myoviridae family. In silico analysis indicated that the vB_VpS_PG28 genome consists of 82712 bp (48.08% GC content) encoding 114 putative ORFs without tRNA,and any gene associated with resistance or virulence factors has not been found. The bacteriophage in the present study has shown significant outcomes in order to control bacterial growth under in vitro conditions. Thus, we are suggesting a beneficiary agent against foodborne pathogens. Further, to ensure the safe usage of phage oral toxicity testing is recommended.

In order to study the role of the microbiome in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), researchers collect stool samples from patients at various time points throughout HCT. However, stool collection requires active subject participation and may be limited by patient reluctance to handling stool.
