The human vagina harbor a rich microbiota. The optimal state is dominated by lactobacilli that help to maintain health and prevent various diseases. However, the microbiota may rapidly change to a polymicrobial state that has been linked to a number of diseases. In the present study, the temporal changes of the vaginal microbiota in patients treated for sexually transmitted diseases or bacterial vaginosis (BV) and in untreated controls were studied for 26 days. The patients included 52 women treated with azithromycin, tetracyclines or moxifloxacin for present or suspected infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Mycoplasma genitalium. Women with concurrent BV were also treated with metronidazole. The controls were 10 healthy women of matching age. The microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing, specific qPCRs and microscopy. There was generally good correlation between Nugent score and community state type (CST) and qPCR confirmed the sequencing results. By sequencing, more than 600 different taxa were found, but only 33 constituted more than 1 ‰ of the sequences. In both patients and controls the microbiota could be divided into three different community state types, CST-I, CST-III and CST-IV. Without metronidazole, the microbiota remained relatively stable regarding CST although changes were seen during menstrual periods. Administration of metronidazole changed the microbiota from CST-IV to CST-III in approximately 50% of the treated patients. In contrast, the CST was generally unaffected by azithromycin or tetracyclines. In 30% of the BV patients, Gardnerella vaginalis was not eradicated by metronidazole. The majority of women colonized with Ureaplasma parvum remained positive after azithromycin while U. urealyticum was eradicated.

Numerous studies confirm the high degree of involvement of the intestinal microbiota in most processes in the human body. There is evidence for the effect of intestinal microbiota on the success of chemo and immunotherapy of oncological diseases. It is assumed that the intestinal microbiota exhibits an indirect effect on the antitumor therapy through such mechanisms as general immunomodulation, an increase in cells that specifically respond to antigens of both microbial and tumor origin, metabolism, degradation (utilization) of drug compounds. The intestinal microbiota is currently considered as an additional, but important target for studying the effective use of antitumor therapy and reducing its toxicity, as well as a predictor of the success of immunotherapy. In this review, we highlight the results of studies published to date that confirm the relationship between gut microbiome and antitumor efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Despite the promising and theoretically substantiated conclusions, there are still some discrepancies among the existing data that will have to be addressed in order to facilitate the further development of this direction.

## Healthy Human Gastrointestinal Microbiome: Composition and Function After a Decade of Exploration.
 28.07.2020, _W Ruan, MA Engevik, JK Spinler, J Versalovic_


_Biomedical Research, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Gastrointestinal Tract, Health Status, Humans, Microbiota_
The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains communities of microbes (bacteria, fungi, viruses) that vary by anatomic location and impact human health. Microbial communities differ in composition based on age, diet, and location in the gastrointestinal tract. Differences in microbial composition have been associated with chronic disease states. In terms of function, microbial metabolites provide key signals that help maintain healthy human physiology. Alterations of the healthy gastrointestinal microbiome have been linked to the development of various disease states including inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and colorectal cancer. While the definition of a healthy GI microbiome cannot be precisely identified, features of a healthy gut microbiome include relatively greater biodiversity and relative abundances of specific phyla and genera. Microbes with desirable functional profiles for the human host have been identified, in addition to specific metabolic features of the microbiome. This article reviews the composition and function of the healthy human GI microbiome, including the relative abundances of different bacterial taxa and the specific metabolic pathways and classes of microbial metabolites contributing to human health and disease prevention.

Disturbances in the gut-brain barrier play an essential role in the development of mental disorders. There is considerable evidence showing that the gut microbiome not only affects digestive, metabolic and immune functions of the host but also regulates host sleep and mental states through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The present review summarizes the role of the gut microbiome in the context of circadian rhythms, nutrition and sleep in psychiatric disorders.

## Diet and Gut Microbes Act Coordinately to Enhance Programmed Cell Death and Reduce Colorectal Cancer Risk.
 28.07.2020, _RS Chapkin, SL Navarro, MAJ Hullar, JW Lampe_


_Animals, Apoptosis, Colorectal Neoplasms, Diet, Diet Therapy, Dietary Fiber, Fatty Acids, Omega-3, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans_
Diet is an important risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC), and several dietary constituents implicated in CRC are modified by gut microbial metabolism. Microbial fermentation of dietary fiber produces short-chain fatty acids, e.g., acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Dietary fiber has been shown to reduce colon tumors in animal models, and, in vitro, butyrate influences cellular pathways important to cancer risk. Furthermore, work from our group suggests that the combined effects of butyrate and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) may enhance the chemopreventive potential of these dietary constituents. We postulate that the relatively low intakes of n-3 PUFA and fiber in Western populations and the failure to address interactions between these dietary components may explain why chemoprotective effects of n-3 PUFA and fermentable fibers have not been detected consistently in prospective cohort studies. In this review, we summarize the evidence outlining the effects of n-3 long-chain PUFA and highly fermentable fiber with respect to alterations in critical pathways important to CRC prevention, particularly intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated programmed cell death resulting from the accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ferroptosis), and epigenetic programming related to lipid catabolism and beta-oxidation-associated genes.

## Diversity of Gut Microbiota and Bifidobacterial Community of Chinese Subjects of Different Ages and from Different Regions.
 29.07.2020, _B Yang, S Yan, Y Chen, RP Ross, C Stanton, J Zhao, H Zhang, W Chen_


Gut microbiota composition and functionality are closely linked to host health. In this study, the fecal microbiota and bifidobacterial communities of 111 healthy volunteers from four regions of China of varying age profiles (Child, 1-5 years; Young, 18-50 years; Elder, 60-80 years; Longevity, ≥90 years) were investigated via high-throughput sequencing. Canonical analysis revealed that the gut microbiota, as well as bifidobacteria profiles of the subjects, clustered according to their regions and age. Eight genera were shared among all subjects, however, certain genera distributed differently in subjects grouped by region and age. Faecalibacterium was enriched in samples from Zhongxiang, unclassified Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae were enriched in the Longevity group, and Bifidobacterium was enriched in Child. Within Bifidobacterium, B. longum was the most abundant species in almost all samples except for Child, in which B. pseudocatenulatum was the most abundant. Additionally, the abundances of B. adolescentis and B. dentium were lower in Child. In conclusion, our results suggest that geography and age affect the structure of the gut microbiota, as well as Bifidobacterium composition, and this variation may greatly associate with the metabolic and immune changes that occur during the process of aging.

The quality of sourdough bread mainly depends on metabolic activities of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by LAB affect positively the technological and nutritional properties of the bread, while phytases improve the bioavailability of the minerals by reducing its phytate content. In the present study, a pool of 152 cereal-sourced LAB were screened for production of phytases and EPS for potential use as sourdough starter cultures for the baking industry. There was large heterogeneity in the phytase activity observed among the screened isolates, with 95% showing the ability to degrade sodium phytate on plates containing Sourdough Simulation Medium (SSM). The isolates Lactobacillus brevis LD65 and Lactobacillus plantarum PB241 showed the highest enzymatic activity, while the isolates ascribed to Weissella confusa were characterized by low or no phytase activity. Only 18% of the screened LAB produced EPS, which were distinguished as ropy or mucoid phenotypes on SSM supplemented with sucrose. Almost all the EPS producers carried one or more genes (epsD/E and/or epsA) involved in the production of heteropolysaccharides (HePS), whereas the isolates ascribed to Leuconostoc citreum and W. confusa carried genes involved in the production of both HePS and homopolysaccharides (HoPS). Monosaccharide composition analysis of the EPS produced by a selected subset of isolates revealed that all the HePS included glucose, mannose, and galactose, though at different ratios. Furthermore, a few isolates ascribed to L. citreum and W. confusa and carrying the gtf gene produced β-glucans after fermentation in an ad hoc formulated barley flour medium. Based on the overall results collected, a subset of candidate sourdough starter cultures for the baking industry was selected, including Lb. brevis LD66 and L. citreum PB220, which showed high phytase activity and positive EPS production.

## The sources and transmission routes of microbial populations throughout a meat processing facility.

Microbial food spoilage is responsible for a considerable amount of waste and can cause food-borne diseases in humans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and children. Therefore, preventing microbial food spoilage is a major concern for health authorities, regulators, consumers, and the food industry. However, the contamination of food products is difficult to control because there are several potential sources during production, processing, storage, distribution, and consumption, where microorganisms come in contact with the product. Here, we use high-throughput full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to provide insights into bacterial community structure throughout a pork-processing plant. Specifically, we investigated what proportion of bacteria on meat are presumptively not animal-associated and are therefore transferred during cutting via personnel, equipment, machines, or the slaughter environment. We then created a facility-specific transmission map of bacterial flow, which predicted previously unknown sources of bacterial contamination. This allowed us to pinpoint specific taxa to particular environmental sources and provide the facility with essential information for targeted disinfection. For example, Moraxella spp., a prominent meat spoilage organism, which was one of the most abundant amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) detected on the meat, was most likely transferred from the gloves of employees, a railing at the classification step, and the polishing tunnel whips. Our results suggest that high-throughput full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing has great potential in food monitoring applications.

## 52 years of ecological restoration following a major disturbance by opencast lignite mining does not reassemble microbiome structures of the original arable soils.
 29.07.2020, _CAO Schmid, R Reichel, P Schröder, N Brüggemann, M Schloter_


Opencast mining for lignite continuously creates areas of land that require restoration. Here we applied a chronosequence approach to investigate the development of soil bacterial communities during 52 years as influenced by the restoration process and subsequent changes in soil physico-chemical conditions starting from the initial reclamation of the sites. By comparison with the unaffected soils near the mine, we were able to address the question if soil bacterial communities have reached a steady state within 52 years, which is comparable to the original soil. Our study revealed three distinct phases of the restoration process, each with a specific bacterial community composition. The effect size of these changes was similar to the one observed for seasonal dynamics at our sites. At the beginning of the restoration process Flavobacteriaceae, Cytophagaceae and Sphingobacteriaceae were found as typical members of the bacterial community as well as Rhizobiales as a result of the cultivation of alfalfa on the restored plots. At later stage the families Peptostreptococcaceae, Desulfurellaceae as well as Streptomycetaceae increased in relative abundance and became dominant members of the bacterial community. Even though overall bacterial abundance and richness exhibited values comparable to the original soil already 5 years after the start of the restoration process, main responder analyses reveal differences in the bacterial community structure even 52 years after the start of the restoration process. Mostly Nitrospirae were reduced in abundance in the soils restored for 52 years compared to the original soils. To broaden the significance of our study, we compared our data bioinformatically with published results from other restored areas, which were previously affected by opencast mining. Despite different durations of the different restoration phase, we could observe a large degree of conformity when bacterial patterns of succession were compared indicating common modes of action of ecological restoration tools for bacterial communities.

## Microbial community dissimilarity for source tracking with application in forensic studies.
 28.07.2020, _KM Carter, M Lu, Q Luo, H Jiang, L An_


Microbial source-tracking is a useful tool for trace evidence analysis in Forensics. Community-wide massively parallel sequencing profiles can bypass the need for satellite microbes or marker sets, which are unreliable when handling unstable samples. We propose a novel method utilizing Aitchison distance to select important suspects/sources, and then integrate it with existing algorithms in source tracking to estimate the proportions of microbial sample coming from important suspects/sources. A series of comprehensive simulation studies show that the proposed method is capable of accurate selection and therefore improves the performance of current methods such as Bayesian SourceTracker and FEAST in the presence of noise microbial sources.
