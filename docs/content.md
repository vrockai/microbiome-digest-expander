## Intestinal mycobiota in health and diseases: from a disrupted equilibrium to clinical opportunities.
 18.03.2021, _X Wu, Y Xia, F He, C Zhu, W Ren_


Bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi establish a complex ecosystem in the gut. Like other microbiota, gut mycobiota plays an indispensable role in modulating intestinal physiology. Notably, the most striking characteristics of intestinal fungi are their extraintestinal functions. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the importance of gut fungi in the regulation of intestinal, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, pancreatic, and brain functions, and we present possible opportunities for the application of gut mycobiota to alleviate/treat human diseases. Video Abstract.

## Sodium houttuyfonate attenuates dextran sulfate sodium associated colitis precolonized with Candida albicans through inducing β-glucan exposure.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is a chronic intestinal disease most likely associated with gut dysbiosis. Candida related mycobiota has been demonstrated to play a role in IBD progression. Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHMs) with antifungal activity have a potential in prevention and treatment of fungi-related IBD. Sodium houttuyfonate (SH) is a promising anti-Candida TCHMs. In this study, a dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis model with Candida albicans precolonization is established. SH gavage can significantly decrease the fungal burdens in feces and colon tissues, reduce disease activity index score, elongate colon length, and attenuate colonic damages. Moreover, SH markedly inhibits the levels of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies, β-glucan, and proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α), and increases anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 level in serum and colon tissue. Further experiments demonstrate that SH could induce β-glucan exposure, priming intestinal macrophages to get rid of colonized C. albicans through the collaboration of Dectin-1 and TLR2/4. With the decreased fungal burden, the protein levels of Dectin-1, TLR2, TLR4, and NF-κBp65 are fallen back, indicating the primed macrophages calm down and the colitis is alleviated. Collectively, these results manifest that SH can attenuate C. albicans associated colitis via β-glucan exposure, deepening our understanding of TCHMs in the prevention and treatment of fungi associated IBD.

Sensing of the gut microbiota, including fungi, regulates mucosal immunity. Whether fungal sensing in the gut can influence immunity at other body sites is unknown. Here we show that fluconazole-induced gut fungal dysbiosis has persistent effects on allergic airway disease in a house dust mite challenge model. Mice with a defined community of bacteria, but lacking intestinal fungi were not susceptible to fluconazole-induced dysbiosis, while colonization with a fungal mixture recapitulated the detrimental effects. Gut-resident mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) expressing the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 were essential for the effect of gut fungal dysbiosis on peripheral immunity. Depletion of CX3CR1+ MNPs or selective inhibition of Syk signaling downstream of fungal sensing in these cells ameliorated lung allergy. These results indicate that disruption of intestinal fungal communities can have persistent effects on peripheral immunity and aggravate disease severity through fungal sensing by gut-resident CX3CR1+ MNPs.

## S100A8 and S100A9 Are Important for Postnatal Development of Gut Microbiota and Immune System in Mice and Infants.

After birth, the immune system matures via interactions with microbes in the gut. The S100 calcium binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9, and their extracellular complex form, S100A8-A9, are found in high amounts in human breast milk. We studied levels of S100A8-A9 in fecal samples (also called fecal calprotectin) from newborns and during infancy, and their effects on development of the intestinal microbiota and mucosal immune system.
