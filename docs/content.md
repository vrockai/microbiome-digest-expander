## Protective Effects of Natural Polysaccharides on Intestinal Barrier Injury: A Review.
 27.01.2022, _J Huo, Z Wu, W Sun, Z Wang, J Wu, M Huang, B Wang, B Sun_


_Humans, Intestinal Diseases, Intestinal Mucosa, Intestines, Polysaccharides, Tight Junction Proteins, Tight Junctions_
Owing to their minimal side effects and effective protection from oxidative stress, inflammation, and malignant growth, natural polysaccharides (NPs) are a potential adjuvant therapy for several diseases caused by intestinal barrier injury (IBI). More studies are accumulating on the protective effects of NPs with respect to IBI, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, this review aims to represent current studies that investigate the protective effects of NPs on IBI by directly maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier integrity (inhibiting oxidative stress, regulating inflammatory cytokine expression, and increasing tight junction protein expression) and indirectly regulating intestinal immunity and microbiota. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying IBI development are briefly introduced, and the structure-activity relationships of polysaccharides with intestinal barrier protection effects are discussed. Potential developments and challenges associated with NPs exhibiting protective effects against IBI have also been highlighted to guide the application of NPs in the treatment of intestinal diseases caused by IBI.

## Nitrogen recycling via gut symbionts increases in ground squirrels over the hibernation season.
 01.02.2022, _MD Regan, E Chiang, Y Liu, M Tonelli, KM Verdoorn, SR Gugel, G Suen, HV Carey, FM Assadi-Porter_


Hibernation is a mammalian strategy that uses metabolic plasticity to reduce energy demands and enable long-term fasting. Fasting mitigates winter food scarcity but eliminates dietary nitrogen, jeopardizing body protein balance. Here, we reveal gut microbiome-mediated urea nitrogen recycling in hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). Ureolytic gut microbes incorporate urea nitrogen into metabolites that are absorbed by the host, with the nitrogen reincorporated into the squirrel's protein pool. Urea nitrogen recycling is greatest after prolonged fasting in late winter, when urea transporter abundance in gut tissue and urease gene abundance in the microbiome are highest. These results reveal a functional role for the gut microbiome during hibernation and suggest mechanisms by which urea nitrogen recycling may contribute to protein balance in other monogastric animals.

## Robust host source tracking building on the divergent and non-stochastic assembly of gut microbiomes in wild and farmed large yellow croaker.
 30.01.2022, _J Zhu, H Li, ZZ Jing, W Zheng, YR Luo, SX Chen, F Guo_


Given the lack of genetic background, the source tracking unknown individuals of fish species with both farmed and wild populations often cannot be robustly achieved. The gut microbiome, which is shaped by both deterministic and stochastic processes, can serve as a molecular marker of fish host source tracking, particularly as an alternative to the yet-to-be-established host genetic marker. A candidate for testing the feasibility is the large yellow croaker, Larimichthys crocea, which is carnivorous and ranks the top mariculture fish in China. Wild resource of this fish was depleted decades ago and might have potential problematic estimation because of escaping of farmed individuals.

## Gut Microbial Trimethylamine is Elevated in Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis and Contributes to Ethanol-Induced Liver Injury in Mice.
 29.01.2022, _RN Helsley, T Miyata, A Kadam, V Venkateshwari, N Sangwan, EC Huang, R Banerjee, AL Brown, KK Fung, W Massey, C Neumann, O Danny, LJ Osborn, RC Schugar, MR McMullen, A Bellar, KL Poulsen, A Kim, V Pathak, M Mrdjen, JT Anderson, B Willard, CJ McClain, M Mitchell, AJ McCullough, S Radaeva, B Barton, G Szabo, S Dasarathy, JC Garcia-Garcia, DM Rotroff, DS Allende, Z Wang, SL Hazen, LE Nagy, JM Brown_


There is mounting evidence that microbes resident in the human intestine contribute to diverse alcohol-associated liver diseases (ALD) including the most deadly form known as alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). However, mechanisms by which gut microbes synergize with excessive alcohol intake to promote liver injury are poorly understood. Furthermore, whether drugs that selectively target gut microbial metabolism can improve ALD has never been tested. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantify the levels of microbe and host choline co-metabolites in healthy controls and AH patients, finding elevated levels of the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) in AH. In subsequent studies, we treated mice with non-lethal bacterial choline TMA lyase (CutC/D) inhibitors to blunt gut microbe-dependent production of TMA in the context of chronic ethanol administration. Indices of liver injury were quantified by complementary RNA sequencing, biochemical, and histological approaches. In addition, we examined the impact of ethanol consumption and TMA lyase inhibition on gut microbiome structure via 16S rRNA sequencing. We show the gut microbial choline metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) is elevated in AH patients and correlates with reduced hepatic expression of the TMA oxygenase flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). Provocatively, we find that small molecule inhibition of gut microbial CutC/D activity protects mice from ethanol-induced liver injury. CutC/D inhibitor-driven improvement in ethanol-induced liver injury is associated with distinct reorganization of the gut microbiome and host liver transcriptome. The microbial metabolite TMA is elevated in patients with AH, and inhibition of TMA production from gut microbes can protect mice from ethanol-induced liver injury.

## Intestinal gluconeogenesis shapes gut microbiota, fecal and urine metabolome in mice with gastric bypass surgery.
 30.01.2022, _J Vily-Petit, A Barataud, C Zitoun, A Gautier-Stein, M Serino, G Mithieux_


Intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN), gastric bypass (GBP) and gut microbiota positively regulate glucose homeostasis and diet-induced dysmetabolism. GBP modulates gut microbiota, whether IGN could shape it has not been investigated. We studied gut microbiota and microbiome in wild type and IGN-deficient mice, undergoing GBP or not, and fed on either a normal chow (NC) or a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. We also studied fecal and urine metabolome in NC-fed mice. IGN and GBP had a different effect on the gut microbiota of mice fed with NC and HFHS diet. IGN inactivation increased abundance of Deltaproteobacteria on NC and of Proteobacteria such as Helicobacter on HFHS diet. GBP increased abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria on NC-fed WT mice and of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria on HFHS-fed WT mice. The combined effect of IGN inactivation and GBP increased abundance of Actinobacteria on NC and the abundance of Enterococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae on HFHS diet. A reduction was observed in the amounf of short-chain fatty acids in fecal (by GBP) and in both fecal and urine (by IGN inactivation) metabolome. IGN and GBP, separately or combined, shape gut microbiota and microbiome on NC- and HFHS-fed mice, and modify fecal and urine metabolome.
