## Impact of Insecticide Resistance on P. falciparum Vectors' Biting, Feeding, and Resting Behaviour in Selected Clusters in Teso North and South Subcounties in Busia County, Western Kenya.
 24.04.2020, _EK Githinji, LW Irungu, PN Ndegwa, MG Machani, RO Amito, BJ Kemei, PN Murima, GM Ombui, AK Wanjoya, CM Mbogo, EM Mathenge_


Behavioural resistance to insecticides restrains the efficacy of vector control tools against mosquito-transmitted diseases. The current study is aimed at determining the impact of insecticide resistance on major malaria vectors' biting, feeding, and resting behaviour in areas with and areas without insecticide resistance in Teso North and Teso South, Busia County, Western Kenya.
