A sedentary lifestyle affects the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota, but previous studies have mainly focused on bacteria instead of fungi. Here, we compared both the fecal bacterial and fungal microbiota compositions and functions in sedentary persons and controls. Subjects from the China Railway Corporation, including 99 inspectors and 88 officials, were enrolled in our study. Fecal microbiota communities were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing for bacteria and ITS sequencing for fungi. We found that the diversity of the gut microbiota of the sedentary group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The sedentary group had a higher abundance of Firmicutes, a lower abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and a higher abundance of Ascomycota, and a lower abundance of Basidiomycota. Furthermore, functional prediction analysis of the fungal microbiota revealed more L-tryptophan degradation to 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde, more phospholipid remodeling (phosphatidylethanolamine, yeast), and more L-tyrosine degradation I, as well as less pentose phosphate pathway (non-oxidative branch), less adenosine nucleotide biosynthesis and less L-valine biosynthesis in the sedentary group (P &lt; 0.05). Thus, a sedentary lifestyle changes the composition and function of the gut microbiota. It may change the pentose phosphate pathway (non-oxidative branch), nucleic acid and amino acid biosynthesis and phospholipid metabolism in fungi.

Host-associated microbiota can be affected by factors related to environmental change, such as urbanization and invasive species. For example, urban areas often affect food availability for animals, which can change their gut microbiota. Invasive parasites can also influence microbiota through competition or indirectly through a change in the host immune response. These interacting factors can have complex effects on host fitness, but few studies have disentangled the relationship between urbanization and parasitism on an organism's gut microbiota. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the effects of urbanization and parasitism by the invasive avian vampire fly (Philornis downsi) on the gut microbiota of nestling small ground finches (Geospiza fuliginosa) on San Cristóbal Island, Galápagos. We conducted a factorial study in which we experimentally manipulated parasite presence in an urban and nonurban area. Faeces were then collected from nestlings to characterize the gut microbiota (i.e. bacterial diversity and community composition). Although we did not find an interactive effect of urbanization and parasitism on the microbiota, we did find main effects of each variable. We found that urban nestlings had lower bacterial diversity and different relative abundances of taxa compared to nonurban nestlings, which could be mediated by introduction of the microbiota of the food items or changes in host physiology. Additionally, parasitized nestlings had lower bacterial richness than nonparasitized nestlings, which could be mediated by a change in the immune system. Overall, this study advances our understanding of the complex effects of anthropogenic stressors on the gut microbiota of birds.

## Metabarcoding using nanopore long-read sequencing for the unbiased characterization of apicomplexan haemoparasites.
 14.10.2023, _LG Huggins, V Colella, ND Young, RJ Traub_


Apicomplexan haemoparasites generate significant morbidity and mortality in humans and other animals, particularly in many low-to-middle income countries. Malaria caused by Plasmodium remains responsible for some of the highest numbers of annual deaths of any human pathogen, whilst piroplasmids, such as Babesia and Theileria can have immense negative economic effects through livestock loss. Diagnosing haemoparasites via traditional methods like microscopy is challenging due to low-level and transient parasitaemia. PCR-based diagnostics overcome these limitations by being both highly sensitive and specific, but they may be unable to accurately detect coinfections or identify novel species. In contrast, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods can characterize all pathogens from a group of interest concurrently, although, the short-read platforms previously used have been limited in the taxonomic resolution achievable. Here, we used Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) long-read MinION™ sequencer to conduct apicomplexan haemoparasite metabarcoding via sequencing the near full-length 18S ribosomal RNA gene, demonstrating its ability to detect Babesia, Hepatozoon, Neospora, Plasmodium, Theileria and Toxoplasma species. This method was tested on blood-extracted DNA from 100 dogs and the results benchmarked against qPCR and Illumina-based metabarcoding. For two common haemoparasites, nanopore sequencing performed as well as qPCR (kappa agreement statistics &gt; 0.98), whilst also detecting one pathogen, Hepatozoon felis, missed by the other techniques. The long-reads obtained by nanopore sequencing provide an improved species-level taxonomic resolution whilst the method's broad applicability mean it can be used to explore apicomplexan communities from diverse mammalian hosts, on a portable sequencer that easily permits adaptation to field use.

## Bacterial networks in Atlantic salmon with Piscirickettsiosis.

An unbalanced composition of gut microbiota in fish is hypothesized to play a role in promoting bacterial infections, but the synergistic or antagonistic interactions between bacterial groups in relation to fish health are not well understood. We report that pathogenic species in the Piscirickettsia, Aeromonas, Renibacterium and Tenacibaculum genera were all detected in the digesta and gut mucosa of healthy Atlantic salmon without clinical signs of disease. Although Piscirickettsia salmonis (and other pathogens) occurred in greater frequencies of fish with clinical Salmonid Rickettsial Septicemia (SRS), the relative abundance was about the same as that observed in healthy fish. Remarkably, the SRS-positive fish presented with a generalized mid-gut dysbiosis and positive growth associations between Piscirickettsiaceae and members of other taxonomic families containing known pathogens. The reconstruction of metabolic phenotypes based on the bacterial networks detected in the gut and mucosa indicated the synthesis of Gram-negative virulence factors such as colanic acid and O-antigen were over-represented in SRS positive fish. This evidence indicates that cooperative interactions between organisms of different taxonomic families within localized bacterial networks might promote an opportunity for P. salmonis to cause clinical SRS in the farm environment.

## Metagenomic analysis reveals a dynamic microbiome with diversified adaptive functions that respond to ovulation regulation in the mouse endometrium.
 13.10.2023, _S Pu, M Wang, J Wang, Q Zhang, X Ma, R Wang, S Yu, L Wang, Y Pan_


Understanding the microflora inhabiting the reproductive tract is important for a better understanding of female physiology and reproductive health. The endometrial fluid from mice in three reproductive stages (A: Unproductive mice; B: Postovulatory mice; C: Postpartum mice) was extracted for microbial DNA extraction and sequencing. Phenotypic and functional analyses of endometrial microbial enrichment was undertaken using LefSe. The results showed 95 genera and 134 species of microorganisms in the uteri of mice. There were differentially distributed genera, among which Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus were more abundant in the endometrial fluid of mice in the unproductive group. That of mice in the postovulatory group was colonized with Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter and was mainly enriched in metabolic pathways and steroid biosynthesis. The presence of Chlamydia, Enterococcus, Pseudomonadales, Acinetobacter, and Clostridium in the endometrial fluid of postpartum mice, in addition to the enrichment of the endocrine system and the Apelin and FoxO signaling pathways, resulted in a higher number of pathogenic pathways than in the other two groups. The results showed that the microbial diversity characteristics in the endometrium of mice in different reproductive states differed and that they could be involved in the regulation of animal reproduction through metabolic pathways and steroid biosynthesis, suggesting that reproductive diseases induced by microbial diversity alterations in the regulation of animal reproduction cannot be ignored.

## Probiotic-fermented tomato alleviates high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice: Insights from microbiome and metabolomics.
 15.10.2023, _B Wei, Z Peng, W Zheng, S Yang, M Wu, K Liu, M Xiao, T Huang, M Xie, T Xiong_


Probiotic-fermented plant-based foods are associated with weight loss. Here, we hypothesized probiotic-fermented tomato (FT) as a functional food with potential to alleviate obesity, thus the obesity-alleviating effects and mechanisms of FT on high-fat diet-induced obese mice were explored via biochemical, gut microbiome, and serum metabolomics analysis. The results showed that FT performed better than unfermented tomato in reducing body weight gain and fat accumulation, improving dyslipidemia and glucose homeostasis, and relieving inflammation and adipocytokine dysregulation. Particularly, live probiotic-fermented tomato (LFT) was associated with improved diversity, composition, and structure of gut microbiota, suppressed obesity-related genera growth (e.g., Clostridium, Olsenella, and Mucispirillum), and promoted beneficial genera growth (e.g., Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Oscillospira), which were associated negatively with body weight, TC, TG, and TNF-α levels. Additionally, LFT was associated with positive changes in glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, unsaturated fatty acids, and amino acids levels. Collectively, as a functional food, LFT possessed potential for obesity alleviation.
