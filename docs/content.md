## Kidney outcomes and prognostic factors of myeloma associated acute kidney injury in the contemporary era.
 17.06.2023, _C Ratnayake, SDJ Gibbs, D Lee_


Myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN) has historically been associated with poor kidney outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the kidney outcomes and identify prognostic factors of myeloma-associated acute kidney injury (M-AKI) in the contemporary era of anti-plasma cell therapy. Patients who received anti-myeloma therapy with M-AKI (January 2012 to June 2020) from a single centre were identified from electronic medical records. Diagnosis of MCN was either biopsy confirmed (BC) or clinically suspected (CS), the latter defined as acute kidney injury with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and involved serum free light chains (iSFLC) &gt;500 mg/L at diagnosis. Twenty-six patients with M-AKI were identified (BC: n = 13, CS: n = 13). Median eGFR at diagnosis was 12 (interquartile range 6-20) mL/min/1.73 m2 . All six dialysis-requiring patients achieved dialysis independence after 71 (43-208) days. The best-achieved eGFR was 47 (32-67) mL/min/1.73 m2 after 120 (63-167) days post-treatment, which was maintained at 47 (33-66) mL/min/1.73 m2 12 months post-treatment. Patients with best-achieved eGFR above the median were more likely to have achieved an iSFLC of &lt;20 mg/L (above median group 62% versus below median group 0%; p &lt; .001) and lower best post-treatment iSFLC (20 (12-90) versus 67 (29-146) mg/L; p &lt; .05). Best-achieved iSFLC was a prognostic factor for superior eGFR following treatment for M-AKI. Despite low eGFR at diagnosis, contemporary anti-myeloma therapy can achieve significant recovery of kidney function.

_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Guild and Niche Determination Enable Targeted Alteration of the Microbiome.
 30.05.2023, _O Moyne, M Al-Bassam, C Lieng, D Thiruppathy, GJ Norton, M Kumar, E Haddad, LS Zaramela, K Zengler_


Microbiome science has greatly contributed to our understanding of microbial life and its essential roles for the environment and human health 1-5 . However, the nature of microbial interactions and how microbial communities respond to perturbations remains poorly understood, resulting in an often descriptive and correlation-based approach to microbiome research 6-8 . Achieving causal and predictive microbiome science would require direct functional measurements in complex communities to better understand the metabolic role of each member and its interactions with others. In this study we present a new approach that integrates transcription and translation measurements to predict competition and substrate preferences within microbial communities, consequently enabling the selective manipulation of the microbiome. By performing metatranscriptomic (metaRNA-Seq) and metatranslatomic (metaRibo-Seq) analysis in complex samples, we classified microbes into functional groups (i.e. guilds) and demonstrated that members of the same guild are competitors. Furthermore, we predicted preferred substrates based on importer proteins, which specifically benefited selected microbes in the community (i.e. their niche) and simultaneously impaired their competitors. We demonstrated the scalability of microbial guild and niche determination to natural samples and its ability to successfully manipulate microorganisms in complex microbiomes. Thus, the approach enhances the design of pre- and probiotic interventions to selectively alter members within microbial communities, advances our understanding of microbial interactions, and paves the way for establishing causality in microbiome science.

## The impact of in vitro embryo production on placental and umbilical cord vascularization is minimized by the addition of reproductive fluids.
 17.06.2023, _E Párraga-Ros, Ú Álvarez-Martín, J Seva, P Coy, R Romar_


Animals born from in-vitro-produced (IVP) embryos show changes in the placenta and umbilical cord vascularization. This study compares the placental and umbilical vascular morphometry in pigs (n = 19) born through artificial insemination (AI group) or after transfer of IVP embryos cultured with (RF-IVP group) or without (C-IVP group) reproductive fluids. The relationship between vascular parameters and animal growth during the first year of life was also analyzed. Samples were collected at birth, fixed, paraffin-embedded, cut in sections, stained, and photographed for vascular and morphometric analysis with ImageJ® and Slide Viewer®. The average daily weight gain was individually scored from birth to the first year of life. No differences were found in placental vascular morphometry among groups, except for the vascular area of small vessels (arterioles, venules, and small vessels) that was higher in the C-IVP group. Regarding the umbilical cord, the values for perimeter (AI: 26.40 ± 3.93 mm; IVP: 30.51 ± 4.74 mm), diameter (AI: 8.35 ± 1.01 mm; IVP: 10.26 ± 1.85 mm), area (AI: 43.18 ± 12.87; IVP: 56.61 ± 14.89 mm2), and Wharton's jelly area (AI: 36.86 ± 12.04 mm2; IVP 48.88 ± 12.80 mm2) were higher in IVP-derived than AI-derived animals, whereas arterial and venous morphometric data were similar between groups. A correlation study showed that placental and umbilical cord vascular phenotypes affect the further growth of pigs. In conclusion, assisted reproductive technologies impact small caliber vessels in the placenta and morphometric parameters in the umbilical cord. The addition of reproductive fluids in IVP-embryo contributes to reduce the differences with in vivo-derived animals.

Currently, infertility affects 8-12% of reproductive age couples worldwide, a problem that also affects women suffering from recurrent implantation failure (RIF). RIF is a complex condition resulting from many physiological and molecular mechanisms involving dynamic endometrium-blastocyst interaction. The most important are the endometrial receptivity process, decidualization, trophoblast invasion, and blastocyst nesting. Although the exact multifactorial pathogenesis of RIF remains unclear, many studies have suggested the association between hormone level imbalance, disturbances of angiogenic and immunomodulatory factors, certain genetic polymorphisms, and occurrence of RIF. These studies were performed in quite small groups. Additionally, the results are inconsistent between ethnicities. The present review briefly summarizes the importance of factors involved in RIF development that could also serve as diagnostic determinants. Moreover, our review could constitute part of a new platform for discovery of novel diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for RIF.

## Therapy of replenishing and regulating for manic episode in bipolar disorder: study protocol for a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.
 16.06.2023, _Y Yang, Y Haining, J Hongxiao, N Yanzhe, W Di, Z Lei, Y Kaijuan, G Yumeng, W Fei, S Weishuang, C Pei_


_Humans, Adolescent, Bipolar Disorder, Mania, Quality of Life, Prospective Studies, Double-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic_
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and recurrent disorder characterized by biphasic mood episodes of mania or hypomania and depression. It affects more than 1% of the global population and is a leading cause of disability in young people. Currently available treatments for BD are still fairly limited in terms of efficacy, with high rates of non-adherence, non-response, and undesirable side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history and rich experience in stabilizing mania and improving quality of life. Aiming at rebalancing and in BD, therapy of replenishing and regulating (RYRY therapy) has been in clinical use for years in China. The present prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of RYRY therapy for bipolar mania and its possible mechanism from the point of regulating gut microbiota and anti-inflammation. A total of 60 eligible participants will be recruited from Beijing Anding Hospital. They will be randomized to either the study group or the control group in a ratio of 1∶1. Participants allocated to the study group will receive RYRY granule, while placebo granule will be applied in the control group. Participants in both groups will be prescribed conventional therapy for manic episode in BD. Four scheduled visits will be conducted over 4 weeks. Outcome measurements include Young Mania Rating Scale, TCM Symptom Pattern Rating Scale, Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale, levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α and the gut microbial community profile of stool samples. Safety outcomes and adverse events will also be recorded. In this study, we set a number of scientific and objective assessments to evaluate the efficacy of RYRY therapy and study into its possible mechanism, hopefully offering clinicians an alternative approach to BD.

## Kidney outcomes and prognostic factors of myeloma associated acute kidney injury in the contemporary era.
 17.06.2023, _C Ratnayake, SDJ Gibbs, D Lee_


Myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN) has historically been associated with poor kidney outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the kidney outcomes and identify prognostic factors of myeloma-associated acute kidney injury (M-AKI) in the contemporary era of anti-plasma cell therapy. Patients who received anti-myeloma therapy with M-AKI (January 2012 to June 2020) from a single centre were identified from electronic medical records. Diagnosis of MCN was either biopsy confirmed (BC) or clinically suspected (CS), the latter defined as acute kidney injury with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and involved serum free light chains (iSFLC) &gt;500 mg/L at diagnosis. Twenty-six patients with M-AKI were identified (BC: n = 13, CS: n = 13). Median eGFR at diagnosis was 12 (interquartile range 6-20) mL/min/1.73 m2 . All six dialysis-requiring patients achieved dialysis independence after 71 (43-208) days. The best-achieved eGFR was 47 (32-67) mL/min/1.73 m2 after 120 (63-167) days post-treatment, which was maintained at 47 (33-66) mL/min/1.73 m2 12 months post-treatment. Patients with best-achieved eGFR above the median were more likely to have achieved an iSFLC of &lt;20 mg/L (above median group 62% versus below median group 0%; p &lt; .001) and lower best post-treatment iSFLC (20 (12-90) versus 67 (29-146) mg/L; p &lt; .05). Best-achieved iSFLC was a prognostic factor for superior eGFR following treatment for M-AKI. Despite low eGFR at diagnosis, contemporary anti-myeloma therapy can achieve significant recovery of kidney function.

## Gut microbiota and cognitive development in infant mice: Quantity and source of potable water.
 16.06.2023, _CS Kim, DM Shin_


_Animals, Mice, Drinking Water, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Dehydration, Cognition, Cognitive Dysfunction, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes_
Not only the water quantity consumed but also the source of drinking water has been considered for their health benefits, but there is limited evidence. We aimed to determine whether the amount and type of drinking water affect physiological and biological functions, including brain function, by confirming how it affects gut microbiota which has an important regulatory role in host physiology. Three-week-old infant mice were subjected to 1) a water restriction experiment (control group, ad libitum consumption of distilled water; dehydration group, time-limited access to distilled water [15 min/day]) and 2) different water source experiment (distilled water, purified water, spring water, and tap water groups). The gut microbiota and cognitive development were analyzed using the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing method and the Barnes maze, respectively. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) changed depending on age (juveniles vs. infants). Insufficient water intake reversed these developmental changes, showing that the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the F/B ratio in dehydrated juvenile mice were similar to those in normal infant mice. Additionally, clustering analysis revealed no significant differences in the intestinal flora in the mice from the different drinking water sources; however, dehydration significantly altered the composition of the genera compared to the other water source groups wherein water was provided ad libitum. Moreover, cognitive development was significantly disrupted by insufficient water intake, although the type of drinking water had no significant influence. Cognitive decline, measured by relative latency, was positively associated with the relative abundance of unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae that were in significantly high relative abundance in the dehydration group. These results suggest that the water quantity consumed, rather than the mineral content of drinking water, is imperative for shaping the early gut microbiota associated with cognitive development during infancy.

## Globally consistent response of plant microbiome diversity across hosts and continents to soil nutrients and herbivores.

_Herbivory, Biomass, Microbiota, Nutrients, Soil_
All multicellular organisms host a diverse microbiome composed of microbial pathogens, mutualists, and commensals, and changes in microbiome diversity or composition can alter host fitness and function. Nonetheless, we lack a general understanding of the drivers of microbiome diversity, in part because it is regulated by concurrent processes spanning scales from global to local. Global-scale environmental gradients can determine variation in microbiome diversity among sites, however an individual host's microbiome also may reflect its local micro-environment. We fill this knowledge gap by experimentally manipulating two potential mediators of plant microbiome diversity (soil nutrient supply and herbivore density) at 23 grassland sites spanning global-scale gradients in soil nutrients, climate, and plant biomass. Here we show that leaf-scale microbiome diversity in unmanipulated plots depended on the total microbiome diversity at each site, which was highest at sites with high soil nutrients and plant biomass. We also found that experimentally adding soil nutrients and excluding herbivores produced concordant results across sites, increasing microbiome diversity by increasing plant biomass, which created a shaded microclimate. This demonstration of consistent responses of microbiome diversity across a wide range of host species and environmental conditions suggests the possibility of a general, predictive understanding of microbiome diversity.

## Genetic mapping and prediction for novel lesion mimic in maize demonstrates quantitative effects from genetic background, environment and epistasis.
 17.06.2023, _A Adak, SC Murray, CI Calderón, V Infante, J Wilker, JI Varela, N Subramanian, T Isakeit, JM Ané, J Wallace, N de Leon, MA Stull, M Brun, J Hill, CD Johnson_


A novel locus was discovered on chromosome 7 associated with a lesion mimic in maize; this lesion mimic had a quantitative and heritable phenotype and was predicted better via subset genomic markers than whole genome markers across diverse environments. Lesion mimics are a phenotype of leaf micro-spotting in maize (Zea mays L.), which can be early signs of biotic or abiotic stresses. Dissecting its inheritance is helpful to understand how these loci behave across different genetic backgrounds. Here, 538 maize recombinant inbred lines (RILs) segregating for a novel lesion mimic were quantitatively phenotyped in Georgia, Texas, and Wisconsin. These RILs were derived from three bi-parental crosses using a tropical pollinator (Tx773) as the common parent crossed with three inbreds (LH195, LH82, and PB80). While this lesion mimic was heritable across three environments based on phenotypic ([Formula: see text] = 0.68) and genomic ([Formula: see text] = 0.91) data, transgressive segregation was observed. A genome-wide association study identified a single novel locus on chromosome 7 (at 70.6 Mb) also covered by a quantitative trait locus interval (69.3-71.0 Mb), explaining 11-15% of the variation, depending on the environment. One candidate gene identified in this region, Zm00001eb308070, is related to the abscisic acid pathway involving in cell death. Genomic predictions were applied to genome-wide markers (39,611 markers) contrasted with a marker subset (51 markers). Population structure explained more variation than environment in genomic prediction, but other substantial genetic background effects were additionally detected. Subset markers explained substantially less genetic variation (24.9%) for the lesion mimic than whole genome markers (55.4%) in the model, yet predicted the lesion mimic better (0.56-0.66 vs. 0.26-0.29). These results indicate this lesion mimic phenotype was less affected by environment than by epistasis and genetic background effects, which explain its transgressive segregation.

## Multimodal remote sensing application for weed competition time series analysis in maize farmland ecosystems.
 17.06.2023, _L Quan, Z Lou, X Lv, D Sun, F Xia, H Li, W Sun_


Although weeds cause serious harm to crops through competition for resources, they also have ecological functions. We need to study the change law of competition between crops and weeds, and achieve scientific farmland weed management under the premise of protecting weed biodiversity. In the research, we perform a competitive experiment in Harbin, China, in 2021, with five periods of maize as the study subjects. Comprehensive competition indices (CCI-A) based on maize phenotypes were used to describe the dynamic processes and results of weeds competition. The relation between in structural and biochemical information of maize and weed competitive intensity (Levels 1-5) at different periods and the effects on yield parameters were analyzed. The results showed that the differences of maize plant height, stalk thickness, and N and P elements among different competition levels (Levels 1-5) changed significantly with increasing competition time. This directly resulted in 10%, 31%, 35% and 53% decrease in maize yield; and 3%, 7%, 9% and 15% decrease in hundred grain weight. Compared to the conventional competition indices, CCI-A had better dispersion in the last four periods and was more suitable for quantifying the time-series response of competition. Then, multi-source remote sensing technologies are applied to reveal the temporal response of spectral and lidar information to community competition. The first-order derivatives of the spectra indicate that the red edge (RE) of competition stressed plots biased in short-wave direction in each period. With increasing competition time, RE of Levels 1-5 shifted towards the long wave direction as a whole. The coefficients of variation of canopy height model (CHM) indicate that weed competition had a significant effect on CHM. Finally, the deep learning model with multimodal data (Mul-3DCNN) is created to achieve a large range of CCI-A predictions for different periods, and achieves a prediction accuracy of R2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 0.095. Overall, this study use of CCI-A indices combined with multimodal temporal remote sensing imagery and DL to achieve large scale prediction of weed competitiveness in different periods of maize.

## Refinements in embryo manipulation applied to CRISPR technology in livestock.
 17.06.2023, _PC Dos Santos-Neto, F Cuadro, M Souza-Neves, M Crispo, A Menchaca_


The implementation of CRISPR technology in large animals requires further improvements in embryo manipulation and transfer to be applied with commercial purposes. In this study we report (a) developmental competence of CRISPR/Cas microinjected zygotes subjected to in vitro culture in large scale programs in sheep; (b) pregnancy outcomes after early-stage (2-8-cell) embryo transfer into the oviduct or the uterine horn; and (c) embryo survival and birth rate after vitrification/warming of CRISPR/Cas microinjected zygotes. Experiment 1 consisted of a retrospective analysis to evaluate embryo developmental rate of in vitro produced zygotes subjected to CRISPR/Cas microinjection (n = 7,819) compared with a subset of non-microinjected zygotes (n = 701). Development rates to blastocyst on Day 6 were 20.0% for microinjected zygotes and 44.9% for non-injected zygotes (P &lt; 0.05). In Experiment 2, CRISPR/Cas microinjected zygotes were transferred on Day 2 after in vitro fertilization (2-8 cell embryos) into the oviductal ampulla (n = 262) or into the uterine horn (n = 276) in synchronized recipient ewes at prefixed time (i.e., approximately two days after ovulation). Pregnant/transferred recipients (24.0% vs. 25.0%), embryo survival/transferred embryos (6.9% vs. 6.2%), and born lambs/pregnant embryos (72.2% vs. 100.0%) did not differ significantly in the two groups. In Experiment 3, CRISPR/Cas microinjected zygotes were maintained under in vitro culture until blastocyst stage (Day 6), and subjected to vitrification/warming via the Cryotop method (n = 474), while a subset of embryos were left fresh as control group (n = 75). Embryos were transferred into the uterine horn of recipient females at prefixed time 8.5 days after the estrous synchronization treatment (i.e., approximately six days after ovulation). Pregnancy rate (30.8% vs. 48.0%), embryo survival rate (14.8% vs. 21.3%), and birth rate (85.7% vs. 75.0%) were not different (PNS) between vitrified and fresh embryos, respectively. In conclusion, the current study in sheep embryos reports (a) suitable developmental rate after CRISPR/Cas microinjection (i.e., 20%), even though it was lower than non-microinjected zygotes; (b) similar outcomes when Day 2-embryos were placed into the uterine horn instead of the oviduct, avoiding both time-consuming and invasive oviduct manipulation, and extended in vitro culture during one week; (c) promising pregnancy and birth rates obtained with vitrification of CRISPR/Cas microinjected embryos. This knowledge on in vitro embryo development, timing of embryo transfer, and cryopreservation of CRISPR/Cas microinjected zygotes have practical implications for the implementation of genome editing technology in large animals.

## Divergence in cell cycle progression is associated with shifted phenology in a multivoltine moth: the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis.

Evolutionary change in diapause timing can be an adaptive response to changing seasonality, and even result in ecological speciation. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating shifts in diapause timing remain poorly understood. One of the hallmarks of diapause is a massive slowdown in the cell cycle of target organs such as the brain and primordial imaginal structures, and resumption of cell cycle proliferation is an indication of diapause termination and resumption of development. Characterizing cell cycle parameters between lineages differing in diapause life history timing may help identify molecular mechanisms associated with alterations of diapause timing. We tested the extent to which progression of the cell cycle differs across diapause between two genetically distinct European corn borer strains that differ in their seasonal diapause timing. We show the cell cycle slows down during larval diapause with a significant decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase. Brain-subesophageal complex cells slow primarily in G0/G1 phase whereas most wing disc cells are in G2 phase. Diapausing larvae of the earlier emerging, bivoltine E-strain (BE) suppressed cell cycle progression less than the later emerging, univoltine Z-strain (UZ) individuals, with a greater proportion of cells in S phase across both tissues during diapause. Additionally, resumption of cell cycle proliferation occurred earlier in the BE strain than in the UZ strain after exposure to diapause-terminating conditions. We propose that regulation of cell cycle progression rates ultimately drives differences in larval diapause termination, and adult emergence timing, between early- and late-emerging European corn borer strains.

## H-type hypertension is a risk factor for chronic total coronary artery occlusion: a cross-sectional study from southwest China.
 16.06.2023, _K Xiao, Z Xv, Y Xv, J Wang, L Xiao, Z Kang, J Zhu, Z He, G Huang_


Chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) is serious and the "last bastion" of percutaneous coronary intervention. Hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) are synergistic and significantly increase cardiovascular event risk. The relationship between H-type hypertension and CTO remains unclear; thus, this cross-sectional study investigated this potential association.

The majority of the current regulatory practices for routine monitoring of beach water quality rely on the culture-based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) to develop criteria for promoting the general public's health. To address the limitations of culture methods and the arguable reliability of FIB in indicating health risks, we developed a Nanopore metagenomic sequencing-based viable cell absolute quantification workflow to rapidly and accurately estimate a broad range of microbes in beach waters by a combination of propidium monoazide (PMA) and cellular spike-ins. Using the simple synthetic bacterial communities mixed with viable and heat-killed cells, we observed near-complete relic DNA removal by PMA with minimal disturbance to the composition of viable cells, demonstrating the feasibility of PMA treatment in profiling viable cells by Nanopore sequencing. On a simple mock community comprised of 15 prokaryotic species, our results showed high accordance between the expected and estimated concentrations, suggesting the accuracy of our method in absolute quantification. We then further assessed the accuracy of our method for counting viable Escherichia coli and Vibrio spp. in beach waters by comparing to culture-based method, which were also in high agreement. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 1 Gb sequences obtained within 2 h would be sufficient to quantify a species having a concentration of ≥ 10 cells/mL in beach waters. Using our viability-resolved quantification workflow to assess the microbial risk of the beach water, we conducted (1) screening-level quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to investigate human illness risk and site-specific risk patterns that might guide risk management efforts and (2) metagenomics-based resistome risk assessment to evaluate another layer of risk caused by difficult illness treatment due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In summary, our metagenomic workflow for the rapid absolute quantification of viable bacteria demonstrated its great potential in paving new avenues toward holistic microbial risk assessment.

## ResFinderFG v2.0: a database of antibiotic resistance genes obtained by functional metagenomics.
 19.05.2023, _R Gschwind, S Ugarcina Perovic, M Weiss, M Petitjean, J Lao, LP Coelho, E Ruppé_


Metagenomics can be used to monitor the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). ARGs found in databases such as ResFinder and CARD primarily originate from culturable and pathogenic bacteria, while ARGs from non-culturable and non-pathogenic bacteria remain understudied. Functional metagenomics is based on phenotypic gene selection and can identify ARGs from non-culturable bacteria with a potentially low identity shared with known ARGs. In 2016, the ResFinderFG v1.0 database was created to collect ARGs from functional metagenomics studies. Here, we present the second version of the database, ResFinderFG v2.0, which is available on the Center of Genomic Epidemiology web server (https://cge.food.dtu.dk/services/ResFinderFG/). It comprises 3913 ARGs identified by functional metagenomics from 50 carefully curated datasets. We assessed its potential to detect ARGs in comparison to other popular databases in gut, soil and water (marine + freshwater) Global Microbial Gene Catalogues (https://gmgc.embl.de). ResFinderFG v2.0 allowed for the detection of ARGs that were not detected using other databases. These included ARGs conferring resistance to beta-lactams, cycline, phenicol, glycopeptide/cycloserine and trimethoprim/sulfonamide. Thus, ResFinderFG v2.0 can be used to identify ARGs differing from those found in conventional databases and therefore improve the description of resistomes.

## Achieving pan-microbiome biological insights via the dbBact knowledge base.
 16.06.2023, _A Amir, E Ozel, Y Haberman, N Shental_


16S rRNA amplicon sequencing provides a relatively inexpensive culture-independent method for studying microbial communities. Although thousands of such studies have examined diverse habitats, it is difficult for researchers to use this vast trove of experiments when interpreting their own findings in a broader context. To bridge this gap, we introduce dbBact - a novel pan-microbiome resource. dbBact combines manually curated information from studies across diverse habitats, creating a collaborative central repository of 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which are assigned multiple ontology-based terms. To date dbBact contains information from more than 1000 studies, which include 1500000 associations between 360000 ASVs and 6500 ontology terms. Importantly, dbBact offers a set of computational tools allowing users to easily query their own datasets against the database. To demonstrate how dbBact augments standard microbiome analysis we selected 16 published papers, and reanalyzed their data via dbBact. We uncovered novel inter-host similarities, potential intra-host sources of bacteria, commonalities across different diseases and lower host-specificity in disease-associated bacteria. We also demonstrate the ability to detect environmental sources, reagent-borne contaminants, and identify potential cross-sample contaminations. These analyses demonstrate how combining information across multiple studies and over diverse habitats leads to better understanding of underlying biological processes.
