## Bacterial Translocation as Inflammatory Driver in Crohn's Disease.
 25.09.2021, _R Linares, R Francés, A Gutiérrez, O Juanola_


Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract responsible for intestinal lesions. The multifactorial etiology attributed to CD includes a combination of environmental and host susceptibility factors, which result in an impaired host-microbe gut interaction. Bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis, increased intestinal barrier permeability, and altered inflammatory responses in patients with CD have been described in the past. Those events explain the pathogenesis of luminal translocation of bacteria or its products into the blood, a frequent event in CD, which, in turn, favors a sustained inflammatory response in these patients. In this review, we navigate through the interaction between bacterial antigen translocation, permeability of the intestinal barrier, immunologic response of the host, and genetic predisposition as a combined effect on the inflammatory response observed in CD. Several lines of evidence support that translocation of bacterial products leads to uncontrolled inflammation in CD patients, and as a matter of fact, the presence of gut bacterial genomic fragments at a systemic level constitutes a marker for increased risk of relapse among CD patients. Also, the significant percentage of CD patients who lose response to biologic therapies may be influenced by the translocation of bacterial products, which are well-known drivers of proinflammatory cytokine production by host immune cells. Further mechanistic studies evaluating cellular and humoral immune responses, gut microbiota alterations, and genetic predisposition will help clinicians to better control and personalize the management of CD patients in the future.

## TNF-α synergises with IFN-γ to induce caspase-8-JAK1/2-STAT1-dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells.
 24.09.2021, _JA Woznicki, N Saini, P Flood, S Rajaram, CM Lee, P Stamou, A Skowyra, M Bustamante-Garrido, K Regazzoni, N Crawford, SS McDade, DB Longley, P Aza-Blanc, F Shanahan, SA Zulquernain, J McCarthy, S Melgar, BL McRae, K Nally_


Rewiring of host cytokine networks is a key feature of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD). Th1-type cytokines-IFN-γ and TNF-α-occupy critical nodes within these networks and both are associated with disruption of gut epithelial barrier function. This may be due to their ability to synergistically trigger the death of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) via largely unknown mechanisms. In this study, through unbiased kinome RNAi and drug repurposing screens we identified JAK1/2 kinases as the principal and nonredundant drivers of the synergistic killing of human IECs by IFN-γ/TNF-α. Sensitivity to IFN-γ/TNF-α-mediated synergistic IEC death was retained in primary patient-derived intestinal organoids. Dependence on JAK1/2 was confirmed using genetic loss-of-function studies and JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs). Despite the presence of biochemical features consistent with canonical TNFR1-mediated apoptosis and necroptosis, IFN-γ/TNF-α-induced IEC death was independent of RIPK1/3, ZBP1, MLKL or caspase activity. Instead, it involved sustained activation of JAK1/2-STAT1 signalling, which required a nonenzymatic scaffold function of caspase-8 (CASP8). Further modelling in gut mucosal biopsies revealed an intercorrelated induction of the lethal CASP8-JAK1/2-STAT1 module during ex vivo stimulation of T cells. Functional studies in CD-derived organoids using inhibitors of apoptosis, necroptosis and JAKinibs confirmed the causative role of JAK1/2-STAT1 in cytokine-induced death of primary IECs. Collectively, we demonstrate that TNF-α synergises with IFN-γ to kill IECs via the CASP8-JAK1/2-STAT1 module independently of canonical TNFR1 and cell death signalling. This non-canonical cell death pathway may underpin immunopathology driven by IFN-γ/TNF-α in diverse autoinflammatory diseases such as IBD, and its inhibition may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of anti-TNFs and JAKinibs.

## The Prebiotic Potential of Inulin-type Fructans: A Systematic Review.
 23.09.2021, _RL Hughes, DA Alvarado, KS Swanson, HD Holscher_


Inulin-type fructans (ITF), including short-chain fructooligosaccharides (scFOS), oligofructose, and inulin, are commonly used fibers that are widely regarded as prebiotic for their ability to be selectively utilized by the intestinal microbiota to confer a health benefit. However, the literature thus far lacks a thorough discussion of the evidence from human clinical trials for the prebiotic effect of ITF, including both effects on the intestinal microbiota composition as well as the intestinal and extraintestinal (e.g., glucose homeostasis, lipids, mineral absorption and bone health, appetite and satiety, inflammation and immune function, and body composition) benefits. Additionally, there is a lack of discussion regarding aspects such as the effect of ITF chain length on its intestinal and extraintestinal effects. The overall objective of this systematic review was to summarize the prebiotic potential of ITF based on the results of human clinical trials in healthy adult populations. Evidence from studies included in the current review suggest that ITF have a prebiotic effect on the intestinal microbiota, promoting the abundances of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Beneficial health effects reported following ITF intake include improved intestinal barrier function, improved laxation, increased insulin sensitivity, decreased triglycerides and an improved lipid profile, increased absorption of calcium and magnesium, and increased satiety. While there is some evidence for differing effects of ITF based on chain length, lack of direct comparisons and detailed descriptions of physicochemical properties limit the ability to draw conclusions from human clinical studies. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota mediates or modifies the effects of ITF on human health and the contribution of individual factors such as age and metabolic health to move towards personalization of prebiotic application.

## Gut microbiota depletion exacerbates cholestatic liver injury via loss of FXR signalling.
 23.09.2021, _KM Schneider, LS Candels, JR Hov, M Myllys, R Hassan, CV Schneider, A Wahlström, A Mohs, S Zühlke, L Liao, C Elfers, K Kilic, M Henricsson, A Molinaro, M Hatting, A Zaza, D Drasdo, M Frissen, AS Devlin, EJC Gálvez, T Strowig, TH Karlsen, JG Hengstler, HU Marschall, A Ghallab, C Trautwein_


Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease of unknown aetiology for which there are no approved therapeutic options. Patients with PSC display changes in gut microbiota and in bile acid (BA) composition; however, the contribution of these alterations to disease pathogenesis remains controversial. Here we identify a role for microbiota-dependent changes in BA synthesis that modulates PSC pathophysiology. In a genetic mouse model of PSC, we show that loss of microbiota-mediated negative feedback control of BA synthesis results in increased hepatic BA concentrations, disruption of bile duct barrier function and, consequently, fatal liver injury. We further show that these changes are dependent on decreased BA signalling to the farnesoid X receptor, which modulates the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in BA synthesis, CYP7A1. Moreover, patients with advanced stages of PSC show suppressed BA synthesis as measured by serum C4 levels, which is associated with poor disease prognosis. Our preclinical data highlight the microbiota-dependent dynamics of BA metabolism in cholestatic liver disease, which could be important for future therapies targeting BA and gut microbiome interactions, and identify C4 as a potential biomarker to functionally stratify patients with PSC and predict disease outcomes.

## Chains of evidence from correlations to causal molecules in microbiome-linked diseases.
 24.09.2021, _SN Chaudhari, MD McCurry, AS Devlin_


Human-associated microorganisms play a vital role in human health, and microbial imbalance has been linked to a wide range of disease states. In this Review, we explore recent efforts to progress from correlative studies that identify microorganisms associated with human disease to experiments that establish causal relationships between microbial products and host phenotypes. We propose that successful efforts to uncover phenotypes often follow a chain of evidence that proceeds from (1) association studies; to (2) observations in germ-free animals and antibiotic-treated animals and humans; to (3) fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs); to (4) identification of strains; and then (5) molecules that elicit a phenotype. Using this experimental 'funnel' as our guide, we explore how the microbiota contributes to metabolic disorders and hypertension, infections, and neurological conditions. We discuss the potential to use FMTs and microbiota-inspired therapies to treat human disease as well as the limitations of these approaches.

## Host and microbiota metabolic signals in aging and longevity.
 24.09.2021, _Y Zhou, G Hu, MC Wang_


Aging is an inevitable biochemical process that adversely affects personal health and poses ever-increasing challenges to society. Recent research has revealed the crucial role of metabolism in regulating aging and longevity. During diverse metabolic processes, the host organism and their symbiotic partners-the microbiota-produce thousands of chemical products (metabolites). Emerging studies have uncovered specific metabolites that act as signaling molecules to actively regulate longevity. Here we review the latest progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which metabolites from the host and/or microbiota promote longevity. We also highlight state-of-the-art technologies for discovering, profiling and imaging aging- and longevity-regulating metabolites and for deciphering the molecular basis of their actions. The broad application of these technologies in aging research, together with future advances, will foster the systematic discovery of aging- and longevity-regulating metabolites and their signaling pathways. These metabolite signals should provide promising targets for developing new interventions to promote longevity and healthy aging.

## Fecal filtrate transplantation protects against necrotizing enterocolitis.
 23.09.2021, _A Brunse, L Deng, X Pan, Y Hui, JL Castro-Mejía, W Kot, DN Nguyen, JB Secher, DS Nielsen, T Thymann_


Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening gastrointestinal disorder afflicting preterm infants, which is currently unpreventable. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising preventive therapy, but the transfer of pathogenic microbes or toxic compounds raise concern. Removal of bacteria from donor feces by micropore filtering may reduce this risk of bacterial infection, while residual bacteriophages could maintain the NEC-preventive effects. We aimed to assess preclinical efficacy and safety of fecal filtrate transplantation (FFT). Using fecal material from healthy suckling piglets, we compared rectal FMT administration (FMT, n = 16) with cognate FFT by either rectal (FFTr, n = 14) or oro-gastric administration (FFTo, n = 13) and saline (CON, n = 16) in preterm, cesarean-delivered piglets as models for preterm infants. We assessed gut pathology and analyzed mucosal and luminal bacterial and viral composition using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and meta-virome sequencing. Finally, we used isolated ileal mucosa, coupled with RNA-Seq, to gauge the host response to the different treatments. Oro-gastric FFT completely prevented NEC, which was confirmed by microscopy, whereas FMT did not perform better than control. Oro-gastric FFT increased viral diversity and reduced Proteobacteria relative abundance in the ileal mucosa relative to control. An induction of mucosal immunity was observed in response to FMT but not FFT. As preterm infants are extremely vulnerable to infections, rational NEC-preventive strategies need incontestable safety profiles. We show in a clinically relevant animal model that FFT, as opposed to FMT, efficiently prevents NEC without any recognizable side effects.

## Effects of konjac glucomannan with different molecular weights on gut microflora with antibiotic perturbance in in vitro fecal fermentation.
 25.09.2021, _YH Mao, YX Xu, YH Li, J Cao, FL Song, D Zhao, Y Zhao, ZM Wang, Y Yang_


This study investigated the effect of konjac glucomannan (KGM) of different molecular weight on fecal microflora against antibiotic disturbance. KGM (~1.8 × 107 Da) was partially hydrolysed with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 10 and 60 min to KGM1 (~2.1 × 104 Da) and KGM2 (7413 Da), respectively. The acid treatment caused significant reduction of intrinsic viscosity, average molecular weight (MW) and particle size of KGM, but brought limited change to the molecular structure. Low-MW KGM2 showed the most significant effect on fecal microflora in the presence of two common antibiotics (ampicillin and clindamycin), by increasing the relative abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae while decreasing the proportion of Enterobacteriaceae. Additionally, both the native and acid-treated KGM counteracted the adverse influence of antibiotics on the production of short chain fatty acids. The results have demonstrated the effect of KGM on gut microbiota with antibiotic disturbance.

## Interactions between dietary polyphenols and aging gut microbiota: A review.
 24.09.2021, _S Davinelli, G Scapagnini_


Aging induces significant shifts in the composition of gut microbiota associated with decreased microbial diversity. Age-related changes in gut microbiota include a loss of commensals and an increase in disease-associated pathobionts. These alterations are accelerated by lifestyle factors, such as poor nutritional habits, physical inactivity, and medications. Given that diet is one of the main drivers shaping the gut microbiota, nutritional interventions for restoring gut homeostasis are of great importance to the overall health of older adults. Polyphenols, ubiquitously present in fruits and vegetables, have emerged as promising anti-aging candidates because of their ability to modulate some of the common denominators of aging, including gut dysbiosis. These compounds can influence the composition of the gut microbiota, and gut bacteria metabolize polyphenols into bioactive compounds that produce relevant health effects. Although the role of polyphenols on the aging gut has not been fully characterized, accumulating evidence suggests that these compounds exert selective effects on the gut microbial community. Here, we discuss the reciprocal interactions between polyphenols and gut microbiota and summarize the latest findings on the effects of polyphenols on modulating intestinal bacteria during aging.

## Safety and efficacy of using heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum L-137: High-dose and long-term use effects on immune-related safety and intestinal bacterial flora.
 24.09.2021, _H Nakai, S Murosaki, Y Yamamoto, M Furutani, R Matsuoka, Y Hirose_


Heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum L-137 (HK L-137) promotes immune function in animals. In healthy people, T-cell proliferation was shown to be enhanced by taking 10 mg HK L-137 daily for 12 weeks. However, the safety and efficacy of higher doses or longer treatments have not yet been investigated in humans. To investigate the high-dose and long-term use effects of HK L-137 on immune-related safety and on host intestinal bacterial flora, 15 healthy volunteers took a daily HK L-137 (50 mg) preparation for 4 weeks. An additional 29 participants who regularly visited a clinic for health care took HK L-137 (10 mg) daily for 12 months. Measures for anthropometrics, hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis were taken at scheduled timepoints for all participants. Stool and blood samples were also collected and evaluated for microbes and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA); isolated T-cells were assessed for levels of proliferation induced by phytohemagglutinin in the long-term study. Adverse events or shifts in clinical measures from normal ranges due to the dietary intervention were not observed in the high-dose or long-term studies. Long-term intake also did not result in immune exhaustion due to any chronic immunostimulation; ex vivo T-cell proliferation was significantly greater at 12 months than at baseline (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in stool samples was significantly lower at 12 months than at baseline (p &lt; 0.05) due to the long-term intake of the HK L-137. Lastly, fecal SCFA concentrations were significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) at 6 months than at baseline. From these data, it can be concluded that the efficacy of HK L-137 is maintained with no overt adverse effects as a result of high-dose and/or long-term consumption.

## Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics for the Prevention of Necrotizing Enterocolitis.
 25.09.2021, _K Murphy, RP Ross, CA Ryan, EM Dempsey, C Stanton_


Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. The exact mechanism by which NEC develops is poorly understood however there is growing evidence to suggest that perturbations in the early-life gut microbiota composition increase the risk for NEC. Modulation of the gut microbiota with probiotics, prebiotics, or in combination (synbiotics) is an area which has attracted intense interest in recent years. In this narrative review, we present an overview of the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of NEC. We also examine the evidence currently available from randomized controlled trials, observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis examining the role of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in reducing the risk of or preventing NEC. Current clinical practice guidelines with recommendations on the routine administration of probiotics to preterm infants for NEC are also explored.

## Main drivers of (poly)phenol effects on human health: metabolite production and/or gut microbiota-associated metabotypes?
 24.09.2021, _CE Iglesias-Aguirre, A Cortés-Martín, MÁ Ávila-Gálvez, JA Giménez-Bastida, MV Selma, A González-Sarrías, JC Espín_


Despite the high human interindividual variability in response to (poly)phenol consumption, the cause-and-effect relationship between some dietary (poly)phenols (flavanols and olive oil phenolics) and health effects (endothelial function and prevention of LDL oxidation, respectively) has been well established. Most of the variables affecting this interindividual variability have been identified (food matrix, gut microbiota, single-nucleotide-polymorphisms, etc.). However, the final drivers for the health effects of (poly)phenol consumption have not been fully identified. At least partially, these drivers could be (i) the (poly)phenols ingested that exert their effect in the gastrointestinal tract, (ii) the bioavailable metabolites that exert their effects systemically and/or (iii) the gut microbial ecology associated with (poly)phenol metabolism (i.e., gut microbiota-associated metabotypes). However, statistical associations between health effects and the occurrence of circulating and/or excreted metabolites, as well as cross-sectional studies that correlate gut microbial ecologies and health, do not prove a causal role unequivocally. We provide a critical overview and perspective on the possible main drivers of the effects of (poly)phenols on human health and suggest possible actions to identify the putative actors responsible for the effects.

## Fructooligosaccharides: From Breast Milk Components to Potential Supplements. A Systematic Review.
 23.09.2021, _V De Cosmi, A Mazzocchi, C Agostoni, F Visioli_


Breast milk is the optimal food choice for infant growth and development. Among breast milk components, fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) are being actively studied because of their role in microbiota development. In particular, 2'-fucosyllactose is being proposed as a potential supplement/nutraceutical or component of infant formula. In this systematic review, we critically summarize the available information on FOSs and we discuss their future use in infant nutrition. We searched the main electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Scopus), with a final check in May 2021. Search terms were inserted individually and using the Boolean tools AND and OR. Relevant articles were identified using the following words: ("fructooligosaccharides" OR "FOS") AND ("human milk" OR "breast milk" OR "donor milk" OR "bank milk"). The search retrieved 1814 articles. After removal of duplicates, we screened 1591 articles based on title, abstract, and exclusive use of the English language. We included articles describing the concentration of FOSs in human milk and assessed the relevant ones. We excluded reviews, studies on animals, and studies exclusively carried out on adults. Also, we excluded studies that have not reported evidence either on FOSs or on galactooligosaccharides from human milk. The resulting publications were reviewed, and 10 studies were included in the systematic review. We conclude that human milk FOSs are, indeed, crucial to infant gut development and their addition to infant formula is safe, well-tolerated, and might provide immune benefits to newborns. However, we would like to underscore the scantiness of human data and the need to avoid the immediate translation of infant research to the commercialization of supplements marketed to adults.

## Effects of Microbiota-Driven Therapy on Circulating Trimethylamine-N-Oxide Metabolism: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
 25.09.2021, _L Miao, J Du, Z Chen, D Shi, H Qu_


Aim: This study was designed to systematically evaluate the effects of microbiota-driven therapy on decreasing TMAO and its related metabolites. Methods and Results: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched (up to July 2021). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), compared microbiota-driven therapy (prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics) with placebo on decreasing TMAO and its related metabolites, were eligible. Two researchers extracted the data independently and the disagreement was resolved by a third researcher. The risk of bias of included study was evaluated using Cochrane tool (RoB 2.0). Meta-analysis, meta-regression analysis and publication bias analysis were performed by RevMan 5.3 or Stata 12.0 software. Ten studies (12 arms) involving 342 patients (168 patients in the intervention group and 174 patients in the control group) were included. Compared with the control group, microbiota-driven therapy did not reduce circulating TMAO [SMD = -0.05, 95% CI (-0.36, 0.26), P = 0.749], choline [SMD = -0.34, 95% CI (-1.09, 0.41), P = 0.373], betaine aldehyde [SMD = -0.704, 95% CI (-1.789, 0.382), P = 0.204], and L-carnatine [SMD = -0.06, 95% CI (-0.38, 0.25), P = 0.692]. Conclusion: Current evidence does not support that microbiota-driven treatment reduce circulating levels of TMAO, choline, betaine aldehyde, and L-carnitine. However, given the small sample size, this conclusion needs to be proved in the future. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO:CRD42019119107.

There is a global increase in reports of emerging diseases, some of which have emerged as spillover events from wild animals. The spleen is a major phagocytic organ and can therefore be probed for systemic microbiome. This study assessed bacterial diversity in the spleen of wild caught small mammals so as to evaluate their utility as surveillance tools for monitoring bacteria in an ecosystem shared with humans.

## Marked Seasonal Variation in Structure and Function of Gut Microbiota in Forest and Alpine Musk Deer.
 25.09.2021, _F Jiang, H Gao, W Qin, P Song, H Wang, J Zhang, D Liu, D Wang, T Zhang_


Musk deer (Moschus spp.) is a globally endangered species due to excessive hunting and habitat fragmentation. Captive breeding of musk deer can efficiently relieve the hunting pressure and contribute to the conservation of the wild population and musk supply. However, its effect on the gut microbiota of musk deer is unclear. Recent studies have indicated that gut microbiota is associated with host health and its environmental adaption, influenced by many factors. Herein, high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used based on 262 fecal samples from forest musk deer (M. berezovskii) (FMD) and 90 samples from alpine musk deer (M. chrysogaster) (AMD). We sought to determine whether seasonal variation can affect the structure and function of gut microbiota in musk deer. The results demonstrated that FMD and AMD had higher α-diversity of gut microbiota in the cold season than in the warm season, suggesting that season change can affect gut microbiota diversity in musk deer. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) also revealed significant seasonal differences in the structure and function of gut microbiota in AMD and FMD. Particularly, phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes significantly dominated the 352 fecal samples from captive FMD and AMD. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes were significantly decreased in summer than in spring and substantially increased in winter than in summer. In contrast, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes showed opposite results. Furthermore, dominant bacterial genera and main metabolic functions of gut microbiota in musk deer showed significant seasonal differences. Overall, the abundance of main gut microbiota metabolic functions in FMD was significantly higher in the cold season. WGCNA analysis indicated that OTU6606, OTU5027, OTU7522, and OTU3787 were at the core of the network and significantly related with the seasonal variation. These results indicated that the structure and function in the gut microbiota of captive musk deer vary with seasons, which is beneficial to the environmental adaptation and the digestion and metabolism of food. This study provides valuable insights into the healthy captive breeding of musk deer and future reintroduction programs to recover wild populations.

## Social groups constrain the spatiotemporal dynamics of wild sifaka gut microbiomes.
 24.09.2021, _AC Perofsky, L Ancel Meyers, LA Abondano, A Di Fiore, RJ Lewis_


Primates acquire gut microbiota from conspecifics through direct social contact and shared environmental exposures. Host behavior is a prominent force in structuring gut microbial communities, yet the extent to which group or individual-level forces shape the long-term dynamics of gut microbiota is poorly understood. We investigated the effects of three aspects of host sociality (social groupings, dyadic interactions, and individual dispersal between groups) on gut microbiome composition and plasticity in 58 wild Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) from six social groups. Over the course of three dry seasons in a five-year period, the six social groups maintained distinct gut microbial signatures, with the taxonomic composition of individual communities changing in tandem among co-residing group members. Samples collected from group members during each season were more similar than samples collected from single individuals across different years. In addition, new immigrants and individuals with less stable social ties exhibited elevated rates of microbiome turnover across seasons. Our results suggest that permanent social groupings shape the changing composition of commensal and mutualistic gut microbial communities and thus may be important drivers of health and resilience in wild primate populations.

## Association of female reproductive tract microbiota with egg production in layer chickens.
 26.09.2021, _Y Su, S Tian, D Li, W Zhu, T Wang, SK Mishra, R Wei, Z Xu, M He, X Zhao, H Yin, X Fan, B Zeng, M Yang, D Yang, Q Ni, Y Li, M Zhang, Q Zhu, M Li_


The microbiota of the female reproductive tract is increasingly recognized as playing fundamental roles in animal reproduction. To explore the relative contribution of reproductive tract microbiomes to egg production in chickens, we investigated the microbiota in multiple reproductive and digestive tract sites from 128 female layer (egg-producing) chickens in comparable environments.

## Prospects for multi-omics in the microbial ecology of water engineering.
 23.09.2021, _EA McDaniel, SA Wahl, S Ishii, A Pinto, R Ziels, PH Nielsen, KD McMahon, RBH Williams_


Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics approaches over almost the last three decades have substantially increased our ability to explore microorganisms and their functions - including those that have yet to be cultivated in pure isolation. Genome-resolved metagenomic approaches have enabled linking powerful functional predictions to specific taxonomical groups with increasing fidelity. Additionally, related developments in both whole community gene expression surveys and metabolite profiling have permitted for direct surveys of community-scale functions in specific environmental settings. These advances have allowed for a shift in microbiome science away from descriptive studies and towards mechanistic and predictive frameworks for designing and harnessing microbial communities for desired beneficial outcomes. Water engineers, microbiologists, and microbial ecologists studying activated sludge, anaerobic digestion, and drinking water distribution systems have applied various (meta)omics techniques for connecting microbial community dynamics and physiologies to overall process parameters and system performance. However, the rapid pace at which new omics-based approaches are developed can appear daunting to those looking to apply these state-of-the-art practices for the first time. Here, we review how modern genome-resolved metagenomic approaches have been applied to a variety of water engineering applications from lab-scale bioreactors to full-scale systems. We describe integrated omics analysis across engineered water systems and the foundations for pairing these insights with modeling approaches. Lastly, we summarize emerging omics-based technologies that we believe will be powerful tools for water engineering applications. Overall, we provide a framework for microbial ecologists specializing in water engineering to apply cutting-edge omics approaches to their research questions to achieve novel functional insights. Successful adoption of predictive frameworks in engineered water systems could enable more economically and environmentally sustainable bioprocesses as demand for water and energy resources increases.

## QSDB-a graphical Quorum Sensing Database.
 24.09.2021, _K Klein, D Garkov, S Rütschlin, T Böttcher, F Schreiber_


The human microbiome is largely shaped by the chemical interactions of its microbial members, which includes cross-talk via shared signals or quenching of the signalling of other species. Quorum sensing is a process that allows microbes to coordinate their behaviour in dependence of their population density and to adjust gene expression accordingly. We present the Quorum Sensing Database (QSDB), a comprehensive database of all published sensing and quenching relations between organisms and signalling molecules of the human microbiome, as well as an interactive web interface that allows browsing the database, provides graphical depictions of sensing mechanisms as Systems Biology Graphical Notation diagrams and links to other databases. Database URL: QSDB (Quorum Sensing DataBase) is freely available via an interactive web interface and as a downloadable csv file at http://qsdb.org.

## Testing microbiome association using integrated quantile regression models.
 23.09.2021, _T Wang, W Ling, AM Plantinga, MC Wu, X Zhan_


Most existing microbiome association analyses focus on the association between microbiome and conditional mean of health or disease-related outcomes, and within this vein, vast computational tools and methods have been devised for standard binary or continuous outcomes. However, these methods tend to be limited either when the underlying microbiome-outcome association occurs somewhere other than the mean level, or when distribution of the outcome variable is irregular (e.g., zero-inflated or mixtures) such that conditional outcome mean is less meaningful. We address this gap by investigating association analysis between microbiome compositions and conditional outcome quantiles.
