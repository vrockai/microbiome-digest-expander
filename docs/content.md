There is intense interest about whether modulating gut microbiota can impact systemic metabolism. We investigated the safety of weekly oral fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) capsules from healthy lean donors and their ability to alter gut microbiota and improve metabolic outcomes in patients with obesity.

## Diet influences the functions of the human intestinal microbiome.

Gut microbes programme their metabolism to suit intestinal conditions and convert dietary components into a panel of small molecules that ultimately affect host physiology. To unveil what is behind the effects of key dietary components on microbial functions and the way they modulate host-microbe interaction, we used for the first time a multi-omic approach that goes behind the mere gut phylogenetic composition and provides an overall picture of the functional repertoire in 27 fecal samples from omnivorous, vegan and vegetarian volunteers. Based on our data, vegan and vegetarian diets were associated to the highest abundance of microbial genes/proteins responsible for cell motility, carbohydrate- and protein-hydrolyzing enzymes, transport systems and the synthesis of essential amino acids and vitamins. A positive correlation was observed when intake of fiber and the relative fecal abundance of flagellin were compared. Microbial cells and flagellin extracted from fecal samples of 61 healthy donors modulated the viability of the human (HT29) colon carcinoma cells and the host response through the stimulation of the expression of Toll-like receptor 5, lectin RegIIIα and three interleukins (IL-8, IL-22 and IL-23). Our findings concretize a further and relevant milestone on how the diet may prevent/mitigate disease risk.

## Gut epithelial metabolism as a key driver of intestinal dysbiosis associated with noncommunicable diseases.
 03.03.2020, _CD Shelton, MX Byndloss_


In high-income countries, the leading causes of death are non-communicable diseases (NCD), such as obesity, cancer and cardiovascular disease. An important feature of most NCDs is inflammation-induced gut dysbiosis characterized by a shift in the microbial community structure from obligate to facultative anaerobes such as Proteobacteria. This microbial imbalance can contribute to disease pathogenesis by either a depletion in or the production of microbiota derived metabolites. However, little is known about the mechanism by which inflammation mediated changes in host physiology disrupt the microbial ecosystem in our large intestine leading to disease. Recent work by our group suggests that during gut homeostasis, epithelial hypoxia derived from PPARγ-dependent β-oxidation of microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids limits oxygen availability in the colon, thereby maintaining a balanced microbial community. During inflammation, disruption in gut anaerobiosis drives an expansion of facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae, regardless of their pathogenic potential. Therefore, our research group is currently exploring the concept that dysbiosis-associated expansion of Enterobacteriaceae can be viewed as a microbial signature of epithelial dysfunction and may play a greater role in different models of NCDs, including diet-induced obesity, atherosclerosis and inflammation-associated colorectal cancer.

## Etiologic features of diarrheagenic microbes in stool specimens from patients with acute diarrhea in Thailand.

Many microbial species have been recognized as enteropathogens for humans. Here, we predicted the causative agents of acute diarrhea using data from multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays targeting 19 enteropathogens. For this, a case-control study was conducted at eight hospitals in Thailand. Stool samples and clinical data were collected from 370 hospitalized patients with acute diarrhea and 370 non-diarrheal controls. Multiple enteropathogens were detected in 75.7% and 13.0% of diarrheal stool samples using multiplex qPCR and bacterial culture methods, respectively. Asymptomatic carriers of enteropathogens were found among 87.8% and 45.7% of individuals by qPCR and culture methods, respectively. These results suggested the complexity of identifying causative agents of diarrhea. An analysis using the quantification cut-off values for clinical relevance drastically reduced pathogen-positive stool samples in control subjects from 87.8% to 0.5%, whereas 48.9% of the diarrheal stool samples were positive for any of the 11 pathogens. Among others, rotavirus, norovirus GII, Shigella/EIEC, and Campylobacter were strongly associated with acute diarrhea (P-value &lt; 0.001). Characteristic clinical symptoms, epidemic periods, and age-related susceptibility to infection were observed for some enteropathogens. Investigations based on qPCR approaches covering a broad array of enteropathogens might thus improve our understanding of diarrheal disease etiology and epidemiological trends.

## Raman-activated sorting of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in human gut microbiota.
 01.03.2020, _Y Wang, J Xu, L Kong, B Li, H Li, WE Huang, C Zheng_


The antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in human gut microbiota have significant impact on human health. Whilst high throughput metagenomic sequencing reveals genotypes of bacteria communities, the functionality, phenotype and heterogeneity of human gut microbiota are still elusive. In this study, we applied Raman microscopy with deuterium isotope probing (Raman-DIP) to detect metabolic active ARB(MA-ARB) in situ at the single-cell level in human gut microbiota from two healthy adults. We analyzed the relative abundances of MA-ARB under different concentrations of amoxicillin, cephalexin, tetracycline, florfenicol and vancomycin. To establish the link between phenotypes and genotypes of the MA-ARB, Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS) was used to sort MA-ARB from human gut microbiota, and mini-metagenomic DNA of the sorted bacteria was amplified, sequenced and analyzed. The sorted MA-ARB and their associated ARGs were identified. We revealed that a genotype does not necessarily lead to a phenotype due to the lack of gene expression. Our results suggest a strong relation between ARB in human gut microbiota and personal medical history. This study demonstrates that the toolkit of Raman-DIP, RACS and DNA sequencing can be useful to unravel both phenotypes and genotypes of ARB in human gut microbiota at the single-cell level.

## Metagenomic analysis reveals the microbiome and resistome in migratory birds.
 03.03.2020, _J Cao, Y Hu, F Liu, Y Wang, Y Bi, N Lv, J Li, B Zhu, GF Gao_


Antibiotic-resistant pathogens pose high risks to human and animal health worldwide. In recent years, the role of gut microbiota as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in humans and animals has been increasingly investigated. However, the structure and function of the gut bacterial community, as well as the ARGs they carry in migratory birds remain unknown.
