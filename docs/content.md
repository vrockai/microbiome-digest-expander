Shotgun metagenomes contain a sample of all the genomic material in an environment, allowing for the characterization of a microbial community. In order to understand these communities, bioinformatics methods are crucial. A common first step in processing metagenomes is to compute abundance estimates of different taxonomic or functional groups from the raw sequencing data. Given the breadth of the field, computational solutions need to be flexible and extensible, enabling the combination of different tools into a larger pipeline.

## Alterations in microbiome composition and metabolic byproducts drive behavioral and transcriptional responses to morphine.
 15.06.2021, _RS Hofford, NL Mervosh, TJ Euston, KR Meckel, AT Orr, DD Kiraly_


Recent evidence has demonstrated that the gut microbiome has marked effects on neuronal function and behavior. Disturbances to microbial populations within the gut have been linked to myriad models of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the role of the microbiome in substance use disorders remains understudied. Here we show that male mice with their gut microbiome depleted by nonabsorbable antibiotics (Abx) exhibit decreased formation of morphine conditioned place preference across a range of doses (2.5-15 mg/kg), have decreased locomotor sensitization to morphine, and demonstrate marked changes in gene expression within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in response to high-dose morphine (20 mg/kg × 7 days). Replacement of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites, which are reduced by microbiome knockdown, reversed the behavioral and transcriptional effects of microbiome depletion. This identifies SCFA as the crucial mediators of microbiome-brain communication responsible for the effects on morphine reward caused by microbiome knockdown. These studies add important new behavioral, molecular, and mechanistic insight to the role of gut-brain signaling in substance use disorders.

## Structural specificities of cell surface β-glucan polysaccharides determine commensal yeast mediated immuno-modulatory activities.
 16.06.2021, _C Lee, R Verma, S Byun, EJ Jeun, GC Kim, S Lee, HJ Kang, CJ Kim, G Sharma, A Lahiri, S Paul, KS Kim, DS Hwang, Y Iwakura, I Speciale, A Molinaro, C De Castro, D Rudra, SH Im_


Yeast is an integral part of mammalian microbiome, and like commensal bacteria, has the potential of being harnessed to influence immunity in clinical settings. However, functional specificities of yeast-derived immunoregulatory molecules remain elusive. Here we find that while under steady state, β-1,3-glucan-containing polysaccharides potentiate pro-inflammatory properties, a relatively less abundant class of cell surface polysaccharides, dubbed mannan/β-1,6-glucan-containing polysaccharides (MGCP), is capable of exerting potent anti-inflammatory effects to the immune system. MGCP, in contrast to previously identified microbial cell surface polysaccharides, through a Dectin1-Cox2 signaling axis in dendritic cells, facilitates regulatory T (Treg) cell induction from naïve T cells. Furthermore, through a TLR2-dependent mechanism, it restrains Th1 differentiation of effector T cells by suppressing IFN-γ expression. As a result, administration of MGCP display robust suppressive capacity towards experimental inflammatory disease models of colitis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, thereby highlighting its potential therapeutic utility against clinically relevant autoimmune diseases.

## Integrated omics endotyping of infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and risk of childhood asthma.
 16.06.2021, _Y Raita, M Pérez-Losada, RJ Freishtat, B Harmon, JM Mansbach, PA Piedra, Z Zhu, CA Camargo, K Hasegawa_


Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is not only the leading cause of hospitalization in U.S. infants, but also a major risk factor for asthma development. While emerging evidence suggests clinical heterogeneity within RSV bronchiolitis, little is known about its biologically-distinct endotypes. Here, we integrated clinical, virus, airway microbiome (species-level), transcriptome, and metabolome data of 221 infants hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis in a multicentre prospective cohort study. We identified four biologically- and clinically-meaningful endotypes: A) clinicalclassicmicrobiomeM. nonliquefaciensinflammationIFN-intermediate, B) clinicalatopicmicrobiomeS. pneumoniae/M. catarrhalisinflammationIFN-high, C) clinicalseveremicrobiomemixedinflammationIFN-low, and D) clinicalnon-atopicmicrobiomeM.catarrhalisinflammationIL-6. Particularly, compared with endotype A infants, endotype B infants-who are characterized by a high proportion of IgE sensitization and rhinovirus coinfection, S. pneumoniae/M. catarrhalis codominance, and high IFN-α and -γ response-had a significantly higher risk for developing asthma (9% vs. 38%; OR, 6.00: 95%CI, 2.08-21.9; P = 0.002). Our findings provide an evidence base for the early identification of high-risk children during a critical period of airway development.

## Anaerobic microbiota derived from the upper airways impact Staphylococcus aureus physiology.
 14.06.2021, _SK Lucas, AR Villarreal, M Ahmad, A Itabiyi, E Feddema, HC Boyer, RC Hunter_


Staphylococcus aureus is associated with the development of persistent and severe inflammatory diseases of the upper airways. Yet, S. aureus is also carried asymptomatically in the sinonasal cavity of ∼50% of healthy adults. The cause(s) of this duality and host and microbial factors that tip the balance between S. aureus pathogenesis and commensalism are poorly understood. We have shown that by degrading mucins, anaerobic microbiota support the growth of airway pathogens by liberating metabolites that are otherwise unavailable. Given the widely reported culture-based detection of anaerobes from individuals with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), here we tested our hypothesis that CRS microbiota is characterized by a mucin degrading phenotype that alters S. aureus physiology. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we indeed observed an increased prevalence and abundance of anaerobes in CRS relative to non-CRS controls. PICRUSt2-based functional predictions suggested increased mucin degradation potential among CRS microbiota that was confirmed by direct enrichment culturing. Prevotella, Fusobacterium, and Streptococcus comprised a core mucin-degrading community across CRS subjects which generated a nutrient pool that augmented S. aureus growth on mucin as a carbon source. Finally, using RNAseq, we observed that S. aureus transcription is profoundly altered in the presence of mucin-derived metabolites, though expression of several key metabolism- and virulence-associated pathways varied between CRS-derived bacterial communities. Together, these data support a model in which S. aureus metabolism and virulence in the upper airways is dependent upon the composition of co-colonizing microbiota and the metabolites they exchange.

## A new biological triangle in cancer: intestinal microbiota, immune checkpoint inhibitors and antibiotics.
 14.06.2021, _J Zhang, Z Dai, C Yan, W Zhang, D Wang, D Tang_


Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of many malignant tumors. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can reactivate the anti-tumor activity of immune cells, sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy depends on the complex tumor immune processes. In recent years, numerous researches have demonstrated the role of intestinal microbiota in immunity and metabolism of the tumor microenvironment, as well as the efficacy of immunotherapy. Epidemiological studies have further demonstrated the efficacy of antibiotic therapy on the probability of patients' response to ICIs and predictability of the short-term survival of cancer patients. Disturbance to the intestinal microbiota significantly affects ICIs-mediated immune reconstitution and is considered a possible mechanism underlying the development of adverse effects during antibiotic-based ICIs treatment. Intestinal microbiota, antibiotics, and ICIs have gradually become important considerations for the titer of immunotherapy. In the case of immunotherapy, the rational use of antibiotics and intestinal microbiota is expected to yield a better prognosis for patients with malignant tumors.

## Catechin Metabolites along with Curcumin Inhibit Proliferation and Induce Apoptosis in Cervical Cancer Cells by Regulating VEGF Expression In-Vitro.
 14.06.2021, _E Khojaste, C Ahmadizadeh_


Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second cause of cancer-related death among women. Over the past two decades, green tea catechins and curcumin have received much attention for their role in preventing carcinogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the catechin metabolites and curcumin on cervical cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. For this aim, the Ca Ski cell line was treated with different doses of catechin metabolites and curcumin. MTT assay and Flow cytometry were employed to investigate the cytotoxic effects of catechin metabolites and curcumin on the Ca Ski cell line. Real-time PCR and western blot were performed to evaluate the VEGF expression. Also, Real-Time PCR was performed to determine the expression level of microRNAs. Results showed that catechin metabolites along with curcumin reduce the VEGF expression. Further, miR-210 and miR-21 as oncogenic microRNAs were down-regulated, while it was reverse for miR-126 as a tumor-suppressor microRNA. Besides, MTT and Flow cytometry results showed that after using catechin metabolites with curcumin, cell survival was reduced by inducing apoptosis. In conclusion, catechin metabolites produced by intestinal microbiota besides the curcumin could serve as a promising therapeutic approach for women with cervical cancer.

## The lung microbiome in lung transplantation.
 14.06.2021, _JE McGinniss, SA Whiteside, A Simon-Soro, JM Diamond, JD Christie, FD Bushman, RG Collman_


Culture-independent study of the lower respiratory tract after lung transplantation has enabled an understanding of the microbiome - that is, the collection of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, and their respective gene complement - in this niche. The lung has unique features as a microbial environment, with balanced entry from the upper respiratory tract, clearance, and local replication. There are many pressures impacting the microbiome after transplantation, including donor allograft factors, recipient host factors such as underlying disease and ongoing exposure to the microbe-rich upper respiratory tract, and transplantation-related immunosuppression, antimicrobials, and postsurgical changes. To date, we understand that the lung microbiome after transplant is dysbiotic; that is, it has higher biomass and altered composition compared to a healthy lung. Emerging data suggest that specific microbiome features may be linked to host responses, both immune and non-immune, and clinical outcomes such as chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), but many questions remain. The goal of this review is to put into context our burgeoning understanding of the lung microbiome in the postlung transplant patient, the interactions between microbiome and host, the role the microbiome may play in post-transplant complications, and critical outstanding research questions.

## Vaginal microbiome: normalcy vs dysbiosis.
 13.06.2021, _VS Saraf, SA Sheikh, A Ahmad, PM Gillevet, H Bokhari, S Javed_


It has been long understood that the vaginal microflora is crucial in maintaining a normal physiological environment for the host and its involvement is deemed indispensable for reproductive success. A global concept of normalcy vs. dysbiosis of vaginal microbiome is debatable as women of different races have a unique vaginal microflora with regional variations. Vaginal microflora is a dynamic microenvironment affected by gestational status, menstrual cycle, sexual activity, age, and contraceptive use. Normal vaginal flora is dominated by lactobacilli especially in women of European descent vs. African American women. These microbes confer the host vagina protection from potentially pathogenic microbes that may lead to urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases. Changes in the vaginal microbiota including reduced lactobacilli abundance and increased facultative and anaerobic organism populations result in bacterial vaginosis, that predisposes the host to several conditions like low birth weight and increased risk of contracting bacterial infections. On the other hand, the vaginal microbiome is also reshaped during pregnancy, with less microbial diversity with a dominance of Lactobacillus species. However, an altered vaginal microbiota with low lactobacilli abundance especially during pregnancy may result in induction of excessive inflammation and pre-term labor. Since the vaginal microbiome plays an important role during embryo implantation, it is not surprising that bacterial vaginosis is more common in infertile women and associated with reduced rates of conception. Probiotic has great success in treating bacterial vaginosis and restoring the normal microbiome in recent. This report, reviewed the relationships between the vaginal microbiome and women's reproductive health.
