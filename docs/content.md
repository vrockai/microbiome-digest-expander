Observational studies have provided evidence of a correlation between alterations in gut microbiota composition and infertility. However, concrete proof supporting the causal relationship is still lacking. We performed a Mendelian randomization study to assess whether genetically gut microbiota composition influences the risk of infertility. The genetic data pertaining to gut microbiota were obtained from a genome-wide association study meta-analysis, which was conducted among 24 cohorts (18,340 participants) from the international MiBioGen consortium. By the primary method of assessing causality, we have identified 2 family taxa, 2 genus taxa, and 1 order taxa that were linked to a low risk of male infertility, while 1 genus taxa were associated with a high risk of male infertility. Furthermore, we have discovered 6 genus taxa, 1 phylum taxa, 1 class taxa, 1 order taxa, and 1 family taxa that were associated with a low risk of female infertility, while 1 genus taxa were linked to a high risk of female infertility. This study successfully confirmed that there was a causal link between gut microbiota and infertility. The identification of these specific strains through genetic prediction offers a valuable insight for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of infertility.

Pressure-overloaded left ventricular remodeling in young population is progressive and readily degenerate into heart failure. The aims of this study were to identify a plasma metabolite that predicts and is mechanistically linked to the disease. Untargeted metabolomics determined elevated plasma kynurenine (Kyn) in both the patient cohorts and the mice model, which was correlated with remodeling parameters. In vitro and in vivo evidence, combined with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), demonstrated that Kyn affected both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHR) to up-regulate hypertrophy- and fibrosis-related genes. Shotgun metagenomics and fecal microbiota transplantation revealed the existence of the altered gut microbiota-Kyn relationship. Supplementation of selected microbes reconstructed the gut microbiota, reduced plasma Kyn, and alleviated ventricular remodeling. Our data collectively discovered a gut microbiota-derived metabolite to activate AHR and its gene targets in remodeling young heart, a process that could be prevented by specific gut microbiota modulation.

## Intratumoral Microbiota Composition Regulates Chemoimmunotherapy Response in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
 11.07.2023, _H Wu, X Leng, Q Liu, T Mao, T Jiang, Y Liu, F Li, C Cao, J Fan, L Chen, Y Chen, Q Yao, S Lu, R Liang, L Hu, M Liu, Y Wan, Z Li, J Peng, Q Luo, H Zhou, J Yin, K Xu, M Lan, X Peng, H Lan, G Li, Y Han, X Zhang, ZJ Xiao, J Lang, G Wang, C Xu_


Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) has shown promise in the treatment of resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The microbiomes of patients can impact therapy response, and previous studies have demonstrated that intestinal microbiota influences cancer immunotherapy by activating gut immunity. Here, we investigated the effects of intratumoral microbiota on the response of ESCC patients to NACI. Intra-tumoral microbiota signatures of β-diversity were disparate and predicted the treatment efficiency of NACI. The enrichment of Streptococcus positively correlated with GrzB+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor tissues. The abundance of Streptococcus could predict prolonged disease-free survival in ESCC. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) demonstrated that responders displayed a higher proportion of CD8+ effector memory T cells but a lower proportion of CD4+ Treg cells. Mice that underwent fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) or intestinal colonization with Streptococcus from responders showed enrichment of Streptococcus in tumor tissues, elevated tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, and a favorable response to anti-PD-1 treatment. Collectively, this study suggests that intratumoral Streptococcus signatures could predict NACI response and sheds light on the potential clinical utility of intratumoral microbiota for cancer immunotherapy.

Obesity among young adults, especially those living in developing countries is increasing. A high body mass index (BMI) is one of the major causes of several diseases worldwide, constituting an important risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Investigations describing the relationship between BMI, clinical and gut microbiota characteristics and lifestyle factors of overweight young adults, especially from Southeast Asian countries are limited. Metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, fecal microbiota profiles and lifestyle factors were compared between overweight Thai young adults (n = 30, mean age 33 ± 9.48) and those with normal weight (n = 30, mean age 27 ±7.50). This study was registered with the Thai Clinical Trials Registry (TCTR20220204007). Health status including body composition, fasting glucose and insulin, lipid profiles, liver and kidney function, inflammatory biomarkers, blood pressure and fecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing data was determined. Dietary intake was assessed using a 3-day dietary record and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), with physical activity levels compared using the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ). The overweight group had significantly higher BMI, waist-hip ratio, body fat mass, % body fat, skeletal mass, triglyceride level, C-reactive protein, insulin and blood pressure, with lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and blood urea nitrogen compared to the normal weight group. Significant differences in fecal microbiota composition at the family and genus levels were observed between the two groups. In our clinical setting, we also observed that unhealthy diets with high consumption of food rich in fat and sugar, processed meat and alcohol, and physical inactivity were associated with an increased prevalence of overweight in Thai young adults. Results provided the big picture of health and lifestyle characteristics of overweight young Thai people. Young adults should be encouraged to engage in health-promoting activities that maintain healthy bodyweight.

We report the first use of constraint-based microbial community modeling on a single individual with episodic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, who has a well documented set of colonic inflammatory biomarkers, as well as metagenomically-sequenced fecal time series covering seven dates over 16 months. Between the first two time steps the individual was treated with both steroids and antibiotics. Our methodology enabled us to identify numerous time-correlated microbial species and metabolites. We found that the individual's dynamical microbial ecology in the disease state led to time-varying in silico overproduction, compared to healthy controls, of more than 24 biologically important metabolites, including methane, thiamine, formaldehyde, trimethylamine N-oxide, folic acid, serotonin, histamine, and tryptamine. The microbe-metabolite contribution analysis revealed that some Dialister species changed metabolic pathways according to the inflammation phases. At the first time point, characterized by the highest levels of serum (complex reactive protein) and fecal (calprotectin) inflammation biomarkers, they produced L-serine or formate. The production of the compounds, through a cascade effect, was mediated by the interaction with pathogenic Escherichia coli strains and Desulfovibrio piger. We integrated the microbial community metabolic models of each time point with a male whole-body, organ-resolved model of human metabolism to track the metabolic consequences of dysbiosis at different body sites. The presence of D. piger in the gut microbiome influenced the sulfur metabolism with a domino effect affecting the liver. These results revealed large longitudinal variations in an individual's gut microbiome ecology and metabolite production, potentially impacting other organs in the body. Future simulations with more time points from an individual could permit us to assess how external drivers, such as diet change or medical interventions, drive microbial community dynamics.

It has been demonstrated in the literature that a dysbiotic microbiome could have a negative impact on the host immune system and promote disease onset or exacerbation. Co-occurrence networks have been widely adopted to identify biomarkers and keystone taxa in the pathogenesis of microbiome-related diseases. Despite the promising results that network-driven approaches have led to in various human diseases, there is a dearth of research pertaining to key taxa that contribute to the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Therefore, our primary goal in this study is to explore co-existing relationships among members of the lung microbial community and any potential gained or lost interactions in lung cancer.

Physical activity is essential in weight management, improves overall health, and mitigates obesity-related risk markers. Besides inducing changes in systemic metabolism, habitual exercise may improve gut's microbial diversity and increase the abundance of beneficial taxa in a correlated fashion. Since there is a lack of integrative omics studies on exercise and overweight populations, we studied the metabolomes and gut microbiota associated with programmed exercise in obese individuals. We measured the serum and fecal metabolites of 17 adult women with overweight during a 6-week endurance exercise program. Further, we integrated the exercise-responsive metabolites with variations in the gut microbiome and cardiorespiratory parameters. We found clear correlation with several serum and fecal metabolites, and metabolic pathways, during the exercise period in comparison to the control period, indicating increased lipid oxidation and oxidative stress. Especially, exercise caused co-occurring increase in levels of serum lyso-phosphatidylcholine moieties and fecal glycerophosphocholine. This signature was associated with several microbial metagenome pathways and the abundance of Akkermansia. The study demonstrates that, in the absence of body composition changes, aerobic exercise can induce metabolic shifts that provide substrates for beneficial gut microbiota in overweight individuals.
