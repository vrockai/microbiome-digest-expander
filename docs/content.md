This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Early-life factors shaping the gut microbiota of Common buzzard nestlings.
 16.05.2024, _H Pereira, N Chakarov, JI Hoffman, T Rinaud, M Ottensmann, KP Gladow, B Tobias, BA Caspers, Ö Maraci, O Krüger_


Exploring the dynamics of gut microbiome colonisation during early-life stages is important for understanding the potential impact of microbes on host development and fitness. Evidence from model organisms suggests a crucial early-life phase when shifts in gut microbiota can lead to immune dysregulation and reduced host condition. However, our understanding of gut microbiota colonisation in long-lived vertebrates, especially during early development, remains limited. We therefore used a wild population of common buzzard nestlings (Buteo buteo) to investigate connections between the early-life gut microbiota colonisation, environmental and host factors.

## Metagenomics datasets of water and sediments from eutrophication-impacted artificial lakes in South Africa.

We present metagenomes of 16 samples of water and sediment from two lakes, collected from eutrophic and non-eutrophic areas, including pooled samples enriched with phosphate and nitrate. Additionally, we assembled 167 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). These MAGs were de-replicated into 83 unique genomes representing different species found in the lakes. All the MAGs exhibited &gt;70% completeness and &lt;10% contamination, with 79 MAGs being classified as 'nearly complete' (completeness &gt;90%), while 54 falling within 80-90% range and 34 between 75-80% complete. The most abundant MAGs identified across all samples were Proteobacteria (n = 80), Firmicutes_A (n = 35), Firmicutes (n = 13), and Bacteriodota (n = 22). Other groups included Desulfobacteria_I (n = 2), Verrucomicrobiota (n = 4), Campylobacterota (n = 4) and Actinobacteriota (n = 6). Importantly, phylogenomic analysis identified that approximately 50.3% of the MAGs could not be classified to known species, suggesting the presence of potentially new and unknown bacteria in these lakes, warranting further in-depth investigation. This study provides valuable new dataset on the diverse and often unique microbial communities living in polluted lakes, useful in developing effective strategies to manage pollution.

Vastly greater quantities of microbial genome data are being generated where environmental samples mix together the DNA from many different species. Here, we present Opal for metagenomic binning, the task of identifying the origin species of DNA sequencing reads. We introduce 'low-density' locality sensitive hashing to bioinformatics, with the addition of Gallager codes for even coverage, enabling quick and accurate metagenomic binning.

## Familial communication and cascade testing following elective genomic testing.
 17.05.2024, _SM Adelson, CL Blout Zawatsky, MR Hickingbotham, ME Bell, DM Platt, JR Leonhard, ES Zoltick, CA Hajek, RC Green, KD Christensen_


Familial communication of results and cascade genetic testing (CGT) can extend the benefits of genetic screening beyond the patient to their at-risk relatives. While an increasing number of health systems are offering genetic screening as an elective clinical service, data are limited about how often results are shared and how often results lead to CGT. From 2018 to 2022, the Sanford Health system offered the Sanford Chip, an elective genomic test that included screening for medically actionable predispositions for disease recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for secondary findings disclosure, to its adult primary care patients. We analyzed patient-reported data about familial sharing of results and CGT among patients who received Sanford Chip results at least 1 year previously. Among the patients identified with medically actionable predispositions, 94.6% (53/56) reported disclosing their result to at least one family member, compared with 46.7% (423/906) of patients with uninformative findings (p &lt; 0.001). Of the patients with actionable predispositions, 52.2% (12/23) with a monogenic disease risk and 12.1% (4/33) with a carrier status reported that their relatives underwent CGT. Results suggest that while the identification of monogenic risk during elective genomic testing motivates CGT in many at-risk relatives, there remain untested at-risk relatives who may benefit from future CGT. Findings identify an area that may benefit from increased genetic counseling and the development of tools and resources to encourage CGT for family members.
