## Untargeted Fecal Metabolomic Analyses across an Industrialization Gradient Reveal Shared Metabolites and Impact of Industrialization on Fecal Microbiome-Metabolome Interactions.

The metabolome is a central determinant of human phenotypes and includes the plethora of small molecules produced by host and microbiome or taken up from exogenous sources. However, studies of the metabolome have so far focused predominantly on urban, industrialized populations. Through an untargeted metabolomic analysis of 90 fecal samples from human individuals from Africa and the Americas-the birthplace and the last continental expansion of our species, respectively-we characterized a shared human fecal metabolome. The majority of detected metabolite features were ubiquitous across populations, despite any geographic, dietary, or behavioral differences. Such shared metabolite features included hyocholic acid and cholesterol. However, any characterization of the shared human fecal metabolome is insufficient without exploring the influence of industrialization. Here, we show chemical differences along an industrialization gradient, where the degree of industrialization correlates with metabolomic changes. We identified differential metabolite features such as amino acid-conjugated bile acids and urobilin as major metabolic correlates of these behavioral shifts. Additionally, coanalyses with over 5,000 publicly available human fecal samples and cooccurrence probability analyses with the gut microbiome highlight connections between the human fecal metabolome and gut microbiome. Our results indicate that industrialization significantly influences the human fecal metabolome, but diverse human lifestyles and behavior still maintain a shared human fecal metabolome. This study represents the first characterization of the shared human fecal metabolome through untargeted analyses of populations along an industrialization gradient. IMPORTANCE As the world becomes increasingly industrialized, understanding the biological consequences of these lifestyle shifts and what it means for past, present, and future human health is critical. Indeed, industrialization is associated with rises in allergic and autoimmune health conditions and reduced microbial diversity. Exploring these health effects on a chemical level requires consideration of human lifestyle diversity, but understanding the significance of any differences also requires knowledge of what molecular components are shared between human groups. Our study reveals the key chemistry of the human gut as defined by varied industrialization-based differences and ubiquitous shared features. Ultimately, these novel findings extend our knowledge of human molecular biology, especially as it is influenced by lifestyle and behavior, and provide steps toward understanding how human biology has changed over our species' history.

## Diet standardization reduces intra-individual microbiome variation.

The human gut microbiota is highly heterogenous between individuals and also exhibits considerable day-to-day variation within individuals. We hypothesized that diet contributed to such inter- and/or intra-individual variance. Hence, we investigated the extent to which diet normalization impacted microbiota heterogeneity. We leveraged the control arm of our recently reported controlled-feeding study in which nine healthy individuals consumed a standardized additive-free diet for 10 days. Diet normalization did not impact inter-individual differences but reduced the extent of intra-individual day-to-day variation in fecal microbiota composition. Such decreased heterogeneity reflected individual-specific enrichment and depletion of an array of taxa microbiota members and was paralleled by a trend toward reduced intra-individual variance in fecal LPS and flagellin, which, collectively, reflect microbiota's pro-inflammatory potential. Yet, the microbiota of some subjects did not change significantly over the course of the study, suggesting heterogeneity in microbiota resilience to dietary stress or that baseline diets of some subjects were perhaps similar to our study's standardized diet. Collectively, our results indicate that short-term diet heterogeneity contributes to day-to-day intra-individual microbiota composition variance.

## A comparative study to determine the association of gut microbiome with schizophrenia in Zhejiang, China.
 26.11.2022, _F Yan, L Xia, L Xu, L Deng, G Jin_


With the rapid progress of high-throughput sequencing technology, characterization of schizophrenia (SZ) with underlying probing of the gut microbiome can explore pathogenic mechanisms, estimate disease risk, and allow customization of therapeutic and prophylactic modalities. In this study, we compared the differences in gut microbial diversity and composition between 50 SZ subjects and 50 healthy matched subjects in Zhejiang, China via targeted next-generation sequencing (16S rRNA amplicon).

## Microbiome analysis in Lascaux Cave in relation to black stain alterations of rock surfaces and collembola.

Anthropization of Palaeolithic caves open for tourism may favour collembola invasion and result in the formation of black stains attributed to pigmented fungi. However, ecological processes underpinning black stain formation are not fully understood. Here, we tested the hypotheses that black stains from the Apse room of Lascaux Cave display a specific microbiota enriched in pigmented fungi, and that collembola thriving on the stains have the potential to consume and disseminate these black fungi. Metabarcoding showed that the microbiota of black stains and neighbouring unstained parts strongly differed, with in black stains a higher prevalence of Ochroconis and other pigmented fungi and the strong regression of Pseudomonas bacteria (whose isolates inhibited in vitro the growth of pigmented fungi). Isotopic analyses indicated that Folsomia candida collembola thriving on stains could feed on black stain in situ and assimilate the pigmented fungi they were fed with in vitro. They could carry these fungi and disseminate them when tested with complex black stains from Lascaux. This shows that black stain formation is linked to the development of pigmented fungi, which coincides with the elimination of antagonistic pseudomonads, and points towards a key role of F. candida collembola in the dynamics of pigmented fungi.
