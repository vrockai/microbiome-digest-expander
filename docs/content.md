## Engineering the gut microbiota to treat chronic diseases.
 22.07.2020, _NS Dosoky, LS May-Zhang, SS Davies_


Gut microbes play vital roles in host health and disease. A number of commensal bacteria have been used as vectors for genetic engineering to create living therapeutics. This review highlights recent advances in engineering gut bacteria for the treatment of chronic diseases such as metabolic diseases, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, and autoimmune disorders. KEY POINTS: • Bacterial homing to tumors has been exploited to deliver therapeutics in mice models. • Engineered bacteria show promise in mouse models of metabolic diseases. • Few engineered bacterial treatments have advanced to clinical studies.
