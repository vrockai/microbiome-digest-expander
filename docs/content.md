## Microbial metabolite delta-valerobetaine is a diet-dependent obesogen.
 21.12.2021, _KH Liu, JA Owens, B Saeedi, CE Cohen, MP Bellissimo, C Naudin, T Darby, S Druzak, K Maner-Smith, M Orr, X Hu, J Fernandes, MC Camacho, S Hunter-Chang, D VanInsberghe, C Ma, T Ganesh, SM Yeligar, K Uppal, YM Go, JA Alvarez, MB Vos, TR Ziegler, MH Woodworth, CS Kraft, RM Jones, E Ortlund, AS Neish, DP Jones_


Obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders are linked to the intestinal microbiome. However, the causality of changes in the microbiome-host interaction affecting energy metabolism remains controversial. Here, we show the microbiome-derived metabolite δ-valerobetaine (VB) is a diet-dependent obesogen that is increased with phenotypic obesity and is correlated with visceral adipose tissue mass in humans. VB is absent in germ-free mice and their mitochondria but present in ex-germ-free conventionalized mice and their mitochondria. Mechanistic studies in vivo and in vitro show VB is produced by diverse bacterial species and inhibits mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation through decreasing cellular carnitine and mitochondrial long-chain acyl-coenzyme As. VB administration to germ-free and conventional mice increases visceral fat mass and exacerbates hepatic steatosis with a western diet but not control diet. Thus, VB provides a molecular target to understand and potentially manage microbiome-host symbiosis or dysbiosis in diet-dependent obesity.

Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in young children. Concepts such as the gut-lung axis have highlighted the impact of microbial communities at distal sites in mediating disease locally. However, little is known about the extent to which microbial communities from multiple body sites are linked, and how this relates to disease susceptibility. Here, we combine 16S-based rRNA sequencing data from 112 healthy, term born infants, spanning three body sites (oral cavity, nasopharynx, gut) and the first six months of life. Using a cross-niche microbial network approach, we show that, already from the first week of life on, there is a strong association between both network structure and species essential to these structures (hub species), and consecutive susceptibility to respiratory tract infections in this cohort. Our findings underline the crucial role of cross-niche microbial connections in respiratory health.

## Human Skin Microbiota in Health and Disease.
 17.12.2021, _L Bay, HC Ring_


Cutaneous microbial composition is driven by the microenvironment of the skin, as well as by internal and external factors. Local changes in the microenvironment can affect the configuration of the community, which may lead toward an imbalance of microbiota. Alterations in the microbial profile are common in both inflammatory skin diseases and chronic infections. A shift in balance within the microbiota, toward limited variation and a greater abundance of specific pathogens, may further worsen the pathogenicity of the diseases. These alterations may be prevented by topical treatment of probiotic solutions stimulating a balanced multispecies community. Compositional variations may further constitute potential biomarkers to predict flares or monitor efficacy during therapy. New approaches such as machine learning may contribute to this prediction of microbial alterations prior to the development of chronic infections and flares. This review provides insight into the composition and distribution of a healthy community of microorganisms in the skin and draws parallels with the community in chronic infections and chronic inflammatory skin diseases such acne vulgaris and Hidradenitis Suppurativa. We discuss the potential role of specific species in the pathogenesis and the possible prevention of disease exacerbation.

## Human implantation: The complex interplay between endometrial receptivity, inflammation, and the microbiome.
 20.12.2021, _J Sehring, R Jeelani_


Human embryo implantation is an intricate spatiotemporal process that involves the intimate association between the embryo and the endometrium of the mother. During implantation, the endometrium undergoes a dynamic cascade of gene activation and repression, largely driven by autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine action. Steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, act on a variety of targets including cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs), cytokines, and growth factors to facilitate the implantation process. Given the synchrony required to achieve implantation, it is unsurprising that embryo implantation represents a substantial problem for infertility patients. This is due to a complex interplay taking place at the level of the endometrium. This review discusses the intricacies of embryo implantation including the window of implantation, the cyclical phases of the endometrium, the implantation process itself, and features of endometrial receptivity. Additionally, we will discuss new research regarding inflammatory reproductive biology, epigenetics and microRNA, and the role of the vaginal and endometrial microbiome in implantation. A better understanding of embryo implantation and the interactions occurring at the level of the blastocyst and the endometrium will improve patient care for infertile patients who experience this frustrating challenge.

Global antibiotic use has been increasing for decades. The gut microbiome, a key contributor to health, can be altered by antibiotics, which have been repeatedly associated with both short-term and long-standing effects on the intestinal microbiome. The aim of the study was to summarise the effects of antibiotics on the diversity and composition of the human microbiota at different anatomical sites.

## Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: the interplay between metabolism, microbes and immunity.
 21.12.2021, _H Tilg, TE Adolph, M Dudek, P Knolle_


Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged pandemically across the globe and particularly affects patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. NAFLD is a complex systemic disease that is characterised by hepatic lipid accumulation, lipotoxicity, insulin resistance, gut dysbiosis and inflammation. In this review, we discuss how metabolic dysregulation, the gut microbiome, innate and adaptive immunity and their interplay contribute to NAFLD pathology. Lipotoxicity has been shown to instigate liver injury, inflammation and insulin resistance. Synchronous metabolic dysfunction, obesity and related nutritional perturbation may alter the gut microbiome, in turn fuelling hepatic and systemic inflammation by direct activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. We review evidence suggesting that, collectively, these unresolved exogenous and endogenous cues drive liver injury, culminating in liver fibrosis and advanced sequelae of this disorder such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding NAFLD as a complex interplay between metabolism, gut microbiota and the immune response will challenge the clinical perception of NAFLD and open new therapeutic avenues.

## Oat Fiber Modulates Hepatic Circadian Clock via Promoting Gut Microbiota-Derived Short Chain Fatty Acids.
 20.12.2021, _S Han, H Gao, R Song, W Zhang, Y Li, J Zhang_


The biological alteration of circadian rhythm was found to be related to the development of metabolic disorders. Our previous studies reported that impaired lipid metabolism caused by a high-fat diet was improved by oat fiber, but did not attempt to answer whether the improvement is mechanistically linked to circadian rhythm. By focusing on circadian alteration, the present study aimed to elucidate the effect of gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on circadian rhythm in a high-fat diet experimental paradigm with and without dietary oat fiber feeding. The results showed that oat fiber prevented the production of obesity and dyslipidemia caused by a high-fat diet in C57BL/6 mice. From a circadian perspective specifically, a high-fat diet disrupted the hepatic circadian protein expressions of the liver clock genes, which were in parallel with the altered oscillation of serum triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting insulin, and the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index. Oat fiber, by contrast, reversed these disrupted diurnal oscillations. Most interestingly, what a high-fat diet induced and what oat fiber prevented were dictated in a close oscillation pattern resembling that of SCFA production facilitated by the intestinal microbiome. Given the results from the present study and from others that demonstrated the role played by SCFAs in regulating circadian rhythm, we conclude that the beneficial effects of oat fiber are likely mediated by complex processes involving multiple mechanisms including a signal transduction pathway of gut microbiota-derived SCFAs to hepatic circadian protein expression to lipid and other metabolic oscillations. The latter warrants more investigation to further determine whether the circadian rhythm pathway has any major and causal significance for the outcome measures in the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders in humans.

## Effects of sublethal azadirachtin on the immune response and midgut microbiome of Apis cerana cerana (Hymenoptera: Apidae).
 20.12.2021, _K Zhao, H Wu, R Hou, J Wu, Y Wang, S Huang, D Cheng, H Xu, Z Zhang_


As a wildly used plant-derived insecticide, azadirachtin (AZA) is commonly reported as harmless to a range of beneficial insects. However, with the research on the effect of AZA against pollinators in recent years, various negative physiological effects on other Apidae species have been demonstrated. Thus to explore the safety of azadirachtin to Apis cerana cerana, the different physiological effects of sublethal concentration of azadirachtin on worker bees A.c.cerana has been studied. With the exposure of 5 mg·L-1 and 10 mg·L-1 azadirachtin for 5 d, the relative expression of Apidaecin, Abaecin and Lysosome genes in workers has decreased significantly at 1, 2,3 and 5 d, and the mRNA levels of Defensin 2 and Hymenoptaecin were also significantly inhibited by 10 mg·L-1 azadirachtin at each check point. Besides, the activity of midgut antioxidant enzymes Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) which are the first line of defence in antioxidant systems was not affected by AZA, the activity of Peroxidase (POD) showed a fluctuating pattern at 24 h and 48 h, while the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) has significantly inhibited by AZA. However, through 16sRNA analysis it was observed that 5 mg·L-1 AZA did not affect the midgut microbiome colony composition and relative abundance, as well as its main function. Therefore, to a certain extent, azadirachtin is safe for workers, but we should pay more attention to the sublethal effect of AZA that also detrimental to the healthy development of the honeybee colony.

## Analysis of the microbial diversity in the fecal material of the critically endangered African wild dog, Lycaon pictus.
 21.12.2021, _FA Sanchez, SE Dowd, J Brandt, RW McLaughlin_


The African wild dog (AWD) (Lycaon pictus) is a critically endangered species. These animals are hypercarnivores, hunting mostly medium-sized antelope. In this study, using bacterial tag-encoded FLX-Titanium amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP®), the microbiota in the fecal material of AWDs living in the Great Plains Zoo &amp; Delbridge Museum of Natural History was investigated. In both samples, the most predominant bacterial phylum was the Firmicutes with members of the genus Blautia spp. being the most dominant bacteria.

## Divergence together with microbes: A comparative study of the associated microbiomes in the closely related Littorina species.
 21.12.2021, _AL Maltseva, MA Varfolomeeva, ER Gafarova, MAZ Panova, NA Mikhailova, AI Granovitch_


Any multicellular organism during its life is involved in relatively stable interactions with microorganisms. The organism and its microbiome make up a holobiont, possessing a unique set of characteristics and evolving as a whole system. This study aimed to evaluate the degree of the conservativeness of microbiomes associated with intertidal gastropods. We studied the composition and the geographic and phylogenetic variability of the gut and body surface microbiomes of five closely related sympatric Littorina (Neritrema) spp. and a more distant species, L. littorea, from the sister subgenus Littorina (Littorina). Although snail-associated microbiomes included many lineages (207-603), they were dominated by a small number of OTUs of the genera Psychromonas, Vibrio, and Psychrilyobacter. The geographic variability was greater than the interspecific differences at the same collection site. While the microbiomes of the six Littorina spp. did not differ at the high taxonomic level, the OTU composition differed between groups of cryptic species and subgenera. A few species-specific OTUs were detected within the collection sites; notably, such OTUs never dominated microbiomes. We conclude that the composition of the high-rank taxa of the associated microbiome ("scaffolding enterotype") is more evolutionarily conserved than the composition of the low-rank individual OTUs, which may be site- and / or species-specific.

## Clinical health issues, reproductive hormones, and metabolic hormones associated with gut microbiome structure in African and Asian elephants.
 21.12.2021, _MM Keady, N Prado, HC Lim, J Brown, S Paris, CR Muletz-Wolz_


The gut microbiome is important to immune health, metabolism, and hormone regulation. Understanding host-microbiome relationships in captive animals may lead to mediating long term health issues common in captive animals. For instance, zoo managed African elephants (Loxodonta africana) and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) experience low reproductive rates, high body condition, and gastrointestinal (GI) issues. We leveraged an extensive collection of fecal samples and health records from the Elephant Welfare Study conducted across North American zoos in 2012 to examine the link between gut microbiota and clinical health issues, reproductive hormones, and metabolic hormones in captive elephants. We quantified gut microbiomes of 69 African and 48 Asian elephants from across 50 zoos using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene.

## Early life skin microbial trajectory as a function of vertical and environmental transmission in Bornean foam-nesting frogs.
 21.12.2021, _S McGrath-Blaser, M Steffen, TU Grafe, M Torres-Sánchez, DS McLeod, CR Muletz-Wolz_


The amphibian skin microbiome is an important mediator of host health and serves as a potential source of undiscovered scientifically significant compounds. However, the underlying modalities of how amphibian hosts obtain their initial skin-associated microbiome remains unclear. Here, we explore microbial transmission patterns in foam-nest breeding tree frogs from Southeast Asia (Genus: Polypedates) whose specialized breeding strategy allows for better delineation between vertically and environmentally derived microbes. To facilitate this, we analyzed samples associated with adult frog pairs taken after mating-including adults of each sex, their foam nests, environments, and tadpoles before and after environmental interaction-for the bacterial communities using DNA metabarcoding data (16S rRNA). Samples were collected from frogs in-situ in Brunei, Borneo, a previously unsampled region for amphibian-related microbial diversity.

## Ancient Metagenomic Studies: Considerations for the Wider Scientific Community.
 21.12.2021, _C Der Sarkissian, IM Velsko, AK Fotakis, ÅJ Vågene, A Hübner, JA Fellows Yates_


Like modern metagenomics, ancient metagenomics is a highly data-rich discipline, with the added challenge that the DNA of interest is degraded and, depending on the sample type, in low abundance. This requires the application of specialized measures during molecular experiments and computational analyses. Furthermore, researchers often work with finite sample sizes, which impedes optimal experimental design and control of confounding factors, and with ethically sensitive samples necessitating the consideration of additional guidelines. In September 2020, early career researchers in the field of ancient metagenomics met (Standards, Precautions &amp; Advances in Ancient Metagenomics 2 [SPAAM2] community meeting) to discuss the state of the field and how to address current challenges. Here, in an effort to bridge the gap between ancient and modern metagenomics, we highlight and reflect upon some common misconceptions, provide a brief overview of the challenges in our field, and point toward useful resources for potential reviewers and newcomers to the field.

## Assessing the impact of storage time on the stability of stool microbiota richness, diversity, and composition.
 21.12.2021, _EA Holzhausen, M Nikodemova, CL Deblois, JH Barnet, PE Peppard, G Suen, KM Malecki_


New technologies like next-generation sequencing have led to a proliferation of studies investigating the role of the gut microbiome in human health, particularly population-based studies that rely upon participant self-collection of samples. However, the impact of methodological differences in sample shipping, storage, and processing are not well-characterized for these types of studies, especially when transit times may exceed 24 h. The aim of this study was to experimentally assess microbiota stability in stool samples stored at 4 °C for durations of 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h with no additives to better understand effects of variable shipping times in population-based studies. These data were compared to a baseline sample that was immediately stored at - 80 °C after stool production.
