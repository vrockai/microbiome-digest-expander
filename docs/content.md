The plant microbiome is an integral part of the host and increasingly recognized as playing fundamental roles in plant growth and health. Increasing evidence indicates that plant rhizosphere recruits beneficial microbes to the plant to suppress soil-borne pathogens. However, the ecological processes that govern plant microbiome assembly and functions in the below- and aboveground compartments under pathogen invasion are not fully understood. Here, we studied the bacterial and fungal communities associated with 12 compartments (e.g., soils, roots, stems, and fruits) of chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) using amplicons (16S and ITS) and metagenomics approaches at the main pepper production sites in China and investigated how Fusarium wilt disease (FWD) affects the assembly, co-occurrence patterns, and ecological functions of plant-associated microbiomes.

## Lipocalin 2 Deficiency Restrains Aging-Related Reshaping of Gut Microbiota Structure and Metabolism.
 01.10.2021, _X Qiu, C Chen, X Chen_


Gut microbiota modulate age-associated changes in metabolism, innate immune responses, and cognitive function. However, the involvement of host factors in the regulation of age-dependent gut microbial structure and intestinal inflammation is largely unknown. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) has previously been identified as an adipocytokine and characterized as an important regulator of diet-induced obesity and inflammation. Previous studies have shown that Lcn2 plays a role in high fat diet-induced reshaping of gut microbiota and intestinal inflammation. However, the role of Lcn2 in the regulation of aging-related reshaping of gut microbiota is unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that fecal levels of Lcn2 are reduced during aging. Age reshaped gut microbiota composition in wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, Lcn2 deficiency diminished this effect of aging in Lcn2 knockout (LKO) mice, leading to decreased bacterial diversity and increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F to B) ratio. Specifically, we identified 16 bacteria at the family level that were differentially abundant between WT and LKO mice at old age. Several health-promoting bacteria, including SCFA-producing bacteria, were significantly less prevalent in old LKO mice compared to WT mice, indicating that Lcn2 deficiency shifts the aging-related gut microbial community towards an unhealthy population and lowers microbial butyrate production. Our results provide a line of evidence that Lcn2 plays a role in the control of aging-related reshaping of gut microbiota composition and metabolites.

## The microbiome-shaping roles of bacteriocins.
 12.10.2021, _S Heilbronner, B Krismer, H Br√∂tz-Oesterhelt, A Peschel_


The microbiomes on human body surfaces affect health in multiple ways. They include not only commensal or mutualistic bacteria but also potentially pathogenic bacteria, which can enter sterile tissues to cause invasive infection. Many commensal bacteria produce small antibacterial molecules termed bacteriocins that have the capacity to eliminate specific colonizing pathogens; as such, bacteriocins have attracted increased attention as potential microbiome-editing tools. Metagenome-based and activity-based screening approaches have strongly expanded our knowledge of the abundance and diversity of bacteriocin biosynthetic gene clusters and the properties of a continuously growing list of bacteriocin classes. The dynamic acquisition, diversification or loss of bacteriocin genes can shape the fitness of a bacterial strain that is in competition with bacteriocin-susceptible bacteria. However, a bacteriocin can only provide a competitive advantage if its fitness benefit exceeds the metabolic cost of production, if it spares crucial mutualistic partner strains and if major competitors cannot develop resistance. In contrast to most currently available antibiotics, many bacteriocins have only narrow activity ranges and could be attractive agents for precision therapy and prevention of infections. A common scientific strategy involving multiple disciplines is needed to uncover the immense potential of microbiome-shaping bacteriocins.
