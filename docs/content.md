## Microbe defines the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drug: A complete paradigm.
 27.08.2021, _P Dalal, D Sharma_


The human body harbors a diverse microbiome that regulates host physiology and disease development. Several studies have also been reported where the human microbiome interferes with the efficacy of chemotherapeutics. Reports have also suggested the use of microbes in specific targeting and drug delivery. This review mainly focuses on the alteration in the efficacy of the drug by human microbiota. We have also discussed how the diversity in microbes can determine the therapeutic outcomes of a particular drug. The pathways involved in the alteration are also focused, with some highlights on microbes being used in cancer therapy.

## Manipulating the neonatal gut microbiome: current understanding and future perspectives.
 26.08.2021, _E Wong, K Lui, AS Day, ST Leach_


The development of a healthy intestinal microbiome following birth contributes to the overall health of the infant during childhood and into adulthood. However, modern birth practices such as caesarean delivery, feeding, antibiotic exposure as well as maternal factors have the potential to greatly impact infant microbiome development. Aberrant microbiome development may be a key factor in the increasing incidence of inflammatory and gut diseases. This review will summarise the current understanding of how modern birth practices may contribute to deficiencies in neonatal gut microbiome development and will also present potential methods of microbiome engineering that aim to ensure the development of a healthy and robust microbiome to protect the host from disease throughout their life.

## Dietary advanced glycation end-products elicit toxicological effects by disrupting gut microbiome and immune homeostasis.
 28.08.2021, _Y Chen, TL Guo_


The aging immune system is characterized by a low-grade chronic systemic inflammatory state ("inflammaging") marked by elevated serum levels of inflammatory molecules such as interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). These inflammatory markers were also reported to be strong predictors for the development/severity of Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and COVID-19. The levels of these markers have been positively associated with those of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) generated via non-enzymatic glycation and oxidation of proteins and lipids during normal aging and metabolism. Based on the above observations, it is clinically important to elucidate how dietary AGEs modulate inflammation and might thus increase the risk for aging-exacerbated diseases. The present narrative review discusses the potential pro-inflammatory properties of dietary AGEs with a focus on the inflammatory mediators CRP, IL-6 and ferritin, and their relations to aging in general and Type 2 diabetes in particular. In addition, underlying mechanisms - including those related to gut microbiota and the receptors for AGEs, and the roles AGEs might play in affecting physiologies of the healthy elderly, obese individuals, and diabetics are discussed in regard to any greater susceptibility to COVID-19.

## The microbiome extends host evolutionary potential.
 27.08.2021, _LP Henry, M Bruijning, SKG Forsberg, JF Ayroles_


The microbiome shapes many host traits, yet the biology of microbiomes challenges traditional evolutionary models. Here, we illustrate how integrating the microbiome into quantitative genetics can help untangle complexities of host-microbiome evolution. We describe two general ways in which the microbiome may affect host evolutionary potential: by shifting the mean host phenotype and by changing the variance in host phenotype in the population. We synthesize the literature across diverse taxa and discuss how these scenarios could shape the host response to selection. We conclude by outlining key avenues of research to improve our understanding of the complex interplay between hosts and microbiomes.

## Enterococcus peptidoglycan remodeling promotes checkpoint inhibitor cancer immunotherapy.
 27.08.2021, _ME Griffin, J Espinosa, JL Becker, JD Luo, TS Carroll, JK Jha, GR Fanger, HC Hang_


The antitumor efficacy of cancer immunotherapy can correlate with the presence of certain bacterial species within the gut microbiome. However, many of the molecular mechanisms that influence host response to immunotherapy remain elusive. In this study, we show that members of the bacterial genus Enterococcus improve checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in mouse tumor models. Active enterococci express and secrete orthologs of the NlpC/p60 peptidoglycan hydrolase SagA that generate immune-active muropeptides. Expression of SagA in nonprotective E. faecalis was sufficient to promote immunotherapy response, and its activity required the peptidoglycan sensor NOD2. Notably, SagA-engineered probiotics or synthetic muropeptides also augmented anti-PD-L1 antitumor efficacy. Taken together, our data suggest that microbiota species with specialized peptidoglycan remodeling activity and muropeptide-based therapeutics may enhance cancer immunotherapy and could be leveraged as next-generation adjuvants.

## Alterations in microbiota and their metabolites are associated with beneficial effects of bile acid sequestrant on icteric primary biliary Cholangitis.
 26.08.2021, _B Li, J Zhang, Y Chen, Q Wang, L Yan, R Wang, Y Wei, Z You, Y Li, Q Miao, X Xiao, M Lian, W Chen, D Qiu, J Fang, ME Gershwin, R Tang, X Ma_


Background: Increasing data suggests an interaction between bile acids and intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Bile acid sequestrants are widely used to bind bile acids in the intestinal lumen and are therefore posited to impact gut bacteria. Herein we aimed to investigate the effects of cholestyramine on the bile acid profile and gut microbiome in a cohort of icteric PBC patients.Results: Thirty-three PBC patients were treated with cholestyramine, serum and stool samples were collected at baseline, 4 and 16 weeks. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and targeted metabolomic profiling were performed. Following cholestyramine administration, patients exhibited a high interpersonal variability in remission of cholestasis, and were therefore dichotomized according to the decrease of total bilirubin. Gut microbial co-abundance networks showed distinct taxa interactions between subjects with superior remission (SR) and those with inferior remission (IR) at baseline. After treatment, compositional shifts of the microbiome in the SR group were characterized with enrichment of two Lachnospiraceae species, typically producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). In contrast, Klebsiella pneumonia, a commensal pathobiont, was only increased in the IR group. Correspondingly, metabolome analysis demonstrated that patients with SR, but not IR, were marked by elevations of SCFAs including valeric acid and caproic acid. Finally, integrative analysis identified robust associations between the variations of microbiota, metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines in SR group, indicating potential mechanistic links.Conclusions: Beneficial responses caused by cholestyramine were closely related with compositional and functional alterations in gut commensal, highlighting the possibility of exploring bile acid-microbiota interactions for treating PBC.

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that leads to hemolytic anemia, pain, organ damage and early mortality. It is characterized by polymerized deoxygenated hemoglobin, rigid sickle red blood cells and vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). Recurrent hypoxia-reperfusion injury in the gut of SCD patients could increase tissue injury, permeability, and bacterial translocation. In this context, the gut microbiome, a major player in health and disease, might have significant impact. This study sought to characterize the gut microbiome in SCD.

## Bacterial resistance to CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials.
 27.08.2021, _RV Uribe, C Rathmer, LJ Jahn, MMH Ellabaan, SS Li, MOA Sommer_


In the age of antibiotic resistance and precise microbiome engineering, CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials promise to have a substantial impact on the way we treat diseases in the future. However, the efficacy of these antimicrobials and their mechanisms of resistance remain to be elucidated. We systematically investigated how a target E. coli strain can escape killing by episomally-encoded CRISPR-Cas9 antimicrobials. Using Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) we studied the killing efficiency and resistance mutation rate towards CRISPR-Cas9 antimicrobials and elucidated the underlying genetic alterations. We find that killing efficiency is not correlated with the number of cutting sites or the type of target. While the number of targets did not significantly affect efficiency of killing, it did reduce the emergence of chromosomal mutations conferring resistance. The most frequent target of resistance mutations was the plasmid-encoded SpCas9 that was inactivated by bacterial genome rearrangements involving translocation of mobile genetic elements such as insertion elements. This resistance mechanism can be overcome by re-introduction of an intact copy of SpCas9. The work presented here provides a guide to design strategies that reduce resistance and improve the activity of CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials.

## The potential prebiotic effect of 2-Butyloctanol on the human axillary microbiome.
 27.08.2021, _M Li, K Truong, S Pillai, T Boyd, A Fan_


The human axilla is colonized by a wide array of microorganisms that contribute to the generation of body odor. Traditional antiperspirant/deodorant products are used to reduce perspiration in the axillary region and to treat or prevent the growth of bacteria in this region, thereby reducing or eliminating body odor. However, they may also compromise the axillary microbiome balance. The personal care industry has been seeking new ingredients, such as prebiotics or probiotics, to maintain a healthy balance of the skin microbiome by inhibiting odor-causing bacteria while maintaining and promoting the growth of good bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the prebiotic effect of a skin care ingredient, 2-butyloctanol, on the human axillary microbiome.

## Fecal Bacteria as Non-Invasive Biomarkers for Colorectal Adenocarcinoma.
 28.08.2021, _B Yuan, B Ma, J Yu, Q Meng, T Du, H Li, Y Zhu, Z Sun, S Ma, C Song_


Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) ranks one of the five most lethal malignant tumors both in China and worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment of CRC could substantially increase the survival rate. Emerging evidence has revealed the importance of gut microbiome on CRC, thus fecal microbial community could be termed as a potential screen for non-invasive diagnosis. Importantly, few numbers of bacteria genus as non-invasive biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity causing less cost would be benefitted more in clinical compared with the whole microbial community analysis. Here we analyzed the gut microbiome between CRC patients and healthy people using 16s rRNA sequencing showing the divergence of microbial composition between case and control. Furthermore, ExtraTrees classifier was performed for the classification of CRC gut microbiome and heathy control, and 13 bacteria were screened as biomarkers for CRC. In addition, 13 biomarkers including 12 bacteria genera and FOBT showed an outstanding sensitivity and specificity for discrimination of CRC patients from healthy controls. This method could be used as a non-invasive method for CRC early diagnosis.

## Molecular genetics for probiotic engineering: dissecting lactic acid bacteria.
 27.08.2021, _R Suissa, R Oved, G Jankelowitz, S Turjeman, O Koren, I Kolodkin-Gal_


The composition of the gut microbiome is greatly influenced by nutrition and dietary alterations which can also induce large temporary microbial shifts. However, the molecular mechanisms that promote these changes remain to be determined. Species of the family Lactobacillaceae and Bacillus species are genetically manipulatable bacteria that are naturally found in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract and are often considered models of beneficial microbiota. Here, we identify specific conserved molecular pathways that play a key role in host colonization by beneficial members of the microbiota. In particular, we highlight three pathways important to the success of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the GI tract: glycolysis and fermentation, microbial communication via membrane vesicles, and condition-dependent antibiotic production. We elaborate on how the understanding of these circuits can lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to combat GI tract infections.

## The effect of probiotic supplementation on the gut microbiota of preterm infants.
 26.08.2021, _EL Plummer, JA Danielewski, SM Garland, J Su, SE Jacobs, GL Murray_


Introduction. Probiotic supplementation of preterm infants may prevent serious morbidities associated with prematurity.Aim. To investigate the impact of probiotic supplementation on the gut microbiota and determine factors associated with detection of probiotic species in the infant gut.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Probiotic supplementation increases the long-term colonization of probiotic species in the gut of preterm infants.Methodology. Longitudinal stool samples were collected from a cohort of very preterm infants participating in a blinded randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of probiotic supplementation (containing Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis BB-02, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and Streptococcus thermophilus TH-4) for prevention of late-onset sepsis. The presence of B. longum subsp. infantis, B. animalis subsp. lactis and S. thermophilus was determined for up to 23 months after supplementation ended using real-time PCR. Logistic regression was used to investigate the impact of probiotic supplementation on the presence of each species.Results. Detection of B. longum subsp. infantis [odds ratio (OR): 53.1; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 35.6-79.1; P &lt; 0.001], B. animalis subsp. lactis (OR: 89.1; 95 % CI: 59.0-134.5; P &lt; 0.001) and S. thermophilus (OR: 5.66; 95 % CI: 4.35-7.37; P &lt; 0.001) was increased during the supplementation period in infants receiving probiotic supplementation. Post-supplementation, probiotic-supplemented infants had increased detection of B. longum subsp. infantis (OR: 2.53; 95 % CI: 1.64-3.90; P &lt; 0.001) and B. animalis subsp. lactis (OR: 1.59; 95 % CI: 1.05-2.41; P=0.030). Commencing probiotic supplementation before 5 days from birth was associated with increased detection of the probiotic species over the study period (B. longum subsp. infantis, OR: 1.20; B. animalis subsp. lactis, OR: 1.28; S. thermophilus, OR: 1.45).Conclusion. Probiotic supplementation with B. longum subsp. infantis BB-02, B. animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 and S. thermophilus TH-4 enhances the presence of probiotic species in the gut microbiota of very preterm infants during and after supplementation. Commencing probiotic supplementation shortly after birth may be important for improving the long-term colonization of probiotic species.

## Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) Fruit Polysaccharides Regulated IBD Mice Via Targeting Gut Microbiota: Association of JNK/ERK/NF-κB Signaling Pathways.
 25.08.2021, _MY Jin, XY Wu, MY Li, XT Li, RM Huang, YM Sun, ZL Xu_


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease characterized by intestinal inflammation with immune dysregulation and intestinal microecological imbalance. In a dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced IBD mouse model, noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) fruit polysaccharides (NFP) with homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I domain decreased the concentration of serum LPS, TNF-α, and IL-17 by 84, 42, and 65%, respectively. It was abolished when intestinal microbiota were depleted by antibiotics. Sequencing analysis of gut microbiota showed an attenuated disruption of the microbial composition in the DSS+NFP group. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed that NFP upregulated the content of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid by onefold but reduced isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid contents. NFP also inhibited JNK, ERK, and NF-κB phosphorylation of IBD mice. Taken together, the mechanism of NFP alleviating IBD is related to the intestinal microecological balance to inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways. This study provides a basis for NFP as a cheap intervention for the prevention and treatment of IBD patients.

## A role for bacterial experimental evolution in coral bleaching mitigation?
 25.08.2021, _J Maire, MJH van Oppen_


Coral reefs are rapidly declining because of widespread mass coral bleaching causing extensive coral mortality. Elevated seawater temperatures are the main drivers of coral bleaching, and climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of destructive marine heatwaves. Efforts to enhance coral thermal bleaching tolerance can be targeted at the coral host or at coral-associated microorganisms (e.g., dinoflagellate endosymbionts and bacteria). The literature on experimental evolution of bacteria suggests that it has value as a tool to increase coral climate resilience. We provide a workflow on how to experimentally evolve coral-associated bacteria to confer thermal tolerance to coral hosts and emphasize the value of implementing this approach in coral reef conservation and restoration efforts.

## Microbial bioindicators of Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease identified in corals and overlying waters using a rapid field-based sequencing approach.
 25.08.2021, _CC Becker, M Brandt, CA Miller, A Apprill_


Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD) is a devastating disease. Since 2014, it has spread along the entire Florida Reef Tract and into the greater Caribbean. It was first detected in the United States Virgin Islands in January 2019. To more quickly identify microbial bioindicators of disease, we developed a rapid pipeline for microbiome sequencing. Over a span of 10 days we collected, processed, and sequenced coral and near-coral seawater microbiomes from diseased and apparently healthy Colpophyllia natans, Montastraea cavernosa, Meandrina meandrites and Orbicella franksi. Analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences revealed 25 bioindicator amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) enriched in diseased corals. These bioindicator ASVs were additionally recovered in near-coral seawater (&lt;5 cm of coral surface), a potential reservoir for pathogens. Phylogenetic analysis of microbial bioindicators with sequences from the Coral Microbiome Database revealed that Vibrio, Arcobacter, Rhizobiaceae, and Rhodobacteraceae sequences were related to disease-associated coral bacteria and lineages novel to corals. Additionally, four ASVs (Algicola, Cohaesibacter, Thalassobius and Vibrio) were matches to microbes previously associated with SCTLD that should be targets for future research. Overall, this work suggests that a rapid sequencing framework paired with specialized databases facilitates identification of microbial disease bioindicators. This article is protected by copyright.

## Assessing age, breeding stage, and mating activity as drivers of variation in the reproductive microbiome of female tree swallows.
 26.08.2021, _J Hernandez, C Hucul, E Reasor, T Smith, JW McGlothlin, DC Haak, LK Belden, IT Moore_


Sexually transmitted microbes are hypothesized to influence the evolution of reproductive strategies. Though frequently discussed in this context, our understanding of the reproductive microbiome is quite nascent. Indeed, testing this hypothesis first requires establishing a baseline understanding of the temporal dynamics of the reproductive microbiome and of how individual variation in reproductive behavior and age influence the assembly and maintenance of the reproductive microbiome as a whole. Here, we ask how mating activity, breeding stage, and age influence the reproductive microbiome. We use observational and experimental approaches to explain variation in the cloacal microbiome of free-living, female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Using microsatellite-based parentage analyses, we determined the number of sires per brood (a proxy for female mating activity). We experimentally increased female sexual activity by administering exogenous 17ß-estradiol. Lastly, we used bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the cloacal microbiome. Neither the number of sires per brood nor the increased sexual activity of females significantly influenced female cloacal microbiome richness or community structure. Female age, however, was positively correlated with cloacal microbiome richness and influenced overall community structure. A hypothesis to explain these patterns is that the effect of sexual activity and the number of mates on variation in the cloacal microbiome manifests over an individual's lifetime. Additionally, we found that cloacal microbiome alpha diversity (Shannon Index, Faith's phylogenetic distance) decreased and community structure shifted between breeding stages. This is one of few studies to document within-individual changes and age-related differences in the cloacal microbiome across successive breeding stages. More broadly, our results contribute to our understanding of the role that host life history and behavior play in shaping the cloacal microbiomes of wild birds.

## Activation of innate immunity during development induces unresolved dysbiotic inflammatory gut and shortens lifespan.
 27.08.2021, _K Yamashita, A Oi, H Kosakamoto, T Yamauchi, H Kadoguchi, T Kuraishi, M Miura, F Obata_


An early-life inflammatory response is associated with risks of age-related pathologies. How transient immune signalling activity during animal development influences life-long fitness is not well understood. Using Drosophila as a model, we find that activation of innate immune pathway Immune deficiency (Imd) signalling in the developing larvae increases adult starvation resistance, decreases food intake and shortens organismal lifespan. Interestingly, lifespan is shortened by Imd activation in the larval gut and fat body, whereas starvation resistance and food intake are altered by that in neurons. The adult flies that developed with Imd activation show sustained Imd activity in the gut, despite complete tissue renewal during metamorphosis. The larval Imd activation increases an immunostimulative bacterial species, Gluconobacter sp., in the gut microbiome, and this dysbiosis is persistent to adulthood. Removal of gut microbiota by antibiotics in the adult fly mitigates intestinal immune activation and rescues the shortened lifespan. This study demonstrates that early-life immune activation triggers long-term physiological changes, highlighted as an irreversible alteration in gut microbiota, prolonged inflammatory intestine and concomitant shortening of the organismal lifespan.

## The composition of the gut microbiota following early-life antibiotic exposure affects host health and longevity in later life.

Studies investigating whether there is a causative link between the gut microbiota and lifespan have largely been restricted to invertebrates or to mice with a reduced lifespan because of a genetic deficiency. We investigate the effect of early-life antibiotic exposure on otherwise healthy, normal chow-fed, wild-type mice, monitoring these mice for more than 700 days in comparison with untreated control mice. We demonstrate the emergence of two different low-diversity community types, post-antibiotic microbiota (PAM) I and PAM II, following antibiotic exposure. PAM II but not PAM I mice have impaired immunity, increased insulin resistance, and evidence of increased inflammaging in later life as well as a reduced lifespan. Our data suggest that differences in the composition of the gut microbiota following antibiotic exposure differentially affect host health and longevity in later life.

Differentiation of intestinal T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which contribute to mucosal barrier protection from invasive pathogens, is dependent on colonization with distinct commensal bacteria. Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are sufficient to support Th17 cell differentiation in mouse, but the molecular and cellular requirements for this process remain incompletely characterized. Here, we show that intestine-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), not intestine proper, are the dominant site of SFB-induced intestinal Th17 cell differentiation. Subsequent migration of these cells to the intestinal lamina propria is dependent on their upregulation of integrin β7. Stat3-dependent induction of RORγt, the Th17 cell-specifying transcription factor, largely depends on IL-6, but signaling through the receptors for IL-21 and IL-23 can compensate for absence of IL-6 to promote SFB-directed Th17 cell differentiation. These results indicate that redundant cytokine signals guide commensal microbe-dependent Th17 cell differentiation in the MLNs and accumulation of the cells in the lamina propria.

## Honeybee intestines retain low yeast titers, but no bacterial mutualists, at emergence.
 26.08.2021, _JP Tauber, D McMahon, EV Ryabov, M Kunat, A Ptaszynska, JD Evans_


Honeybee symbionts, predominantly bacteria, play important roles in honeybee health, nutrition and pathogen protection, thereby supporting colony health. On the other hand, fungi are often considered indicators of poor bee health and honeybee microbiome studies generally exclude fungi and yeasts. We hypothesized that yeasts may be an important aspect of early honeybee biology and if yeasts provide a mutual benefit to their hosts, then honeybees could provide a refuge during metamorphosis to ensure the presence of yeasts at emergence. We surveyed for yeast and fungi during pupal development and metamorphosis in worker bees using fungal-specific qPCR, next-generation sequencing and standard microbiological culturing. Based on yeast presence in three distinct apiaries and multiple developmental stages, we conclude that yeasts can survive through metamorphosis and in naïve worker bees, albeit at relatively low levels. In comparison, known bacterial mutualists, like Gilliamella and Snodgrassella, were generally not found in pre-eclosed adult bees. Whether yeasts are actively retained as an important part of the bee microbiota or are passively propagating in the colony remains unknown. Our demonstration of the constancy of yeasts throughout development provides a framework to further understand the honeybee microbiota.

## The oral microbiota of wild bears in Sweden reflects the history of antibiotic use by humans.
 26.08.2021, _JC Brealey, HG Leitão, T Hofstede, DC Kalthoff, K Guschanski_


Following the advent of industrial-scale antibiotic production in the 1940s,1 antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been on the rise and now poses a major global health threat in terms of mortality, morbidity, and economic burden.2,3 Because AMR can be exchanged between humans, livestock, and wildlife, wild animals can be used as indicators of human-associated AMR contamination of the environment.4 However, AMR is a normal function of natural environments and is present in host-associated microbiomes, which makes it challenging to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural sources.4,5 One way to overcome this difficulty is to use historical samples that span the period from before the mass production of antibiotics to today. We used shotgun metagenomic sequencing of dental calculus, the calcified form of the oral microbial biofilm, to determine the abundance and repertoire of AMR genes in the oral microbiome of Swedish brown bears collected over the last 180 years. Our temporal metagenomics approach allowed us to establish a baseline of natural AMR in the pre-antibiotics era and to quantify a significant increase in total AMR load and diversity of AMR genes that is consistent with patterns of national human antibiotic use. We also demonstrated a significant decrease in total AMR load in bears in the last two decades, which coincides with Swedish strategies to mitigate AMR. Our study suggests that public health policies can be effective in limiting human-associated AMR contamination of the environment and wildlife.

## Wolves, dogs and humans in regular contact can mutually impact each other's skin microbiota.
 25.08.2021, _SU Wetzels, CR Strachan, B Conrady, M Wagner, IA Burgener, Z Virányi, E Selberherr_


In contrast to humans and dogs, the skin microbiota of wolves is yet to be described. Here, we investigated the skin microbiota of dogs and wolves kept in outdoor packs at the Wolf Science Center (WSC) via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Skin swab samples were also collected from human care takers and their pet dogs. When comparing the three canine groups, representing different degrees of human contact to the care takers and each other, the pet dogs showed the highest level of diversity. Additionally, while human skin was dominated by a few abundant phylotypes, the skin microbiota of the care takers who had particularly close contact with the WSC animals was more similar to the microbiota of dogs and wolves compared to the humans who had less contact with these animals. Our results suggest that domestication may have an impact on the diversity of the skin microbiota, and that the canine skin microbiota can be shared with humans, depending on the level of interaction.

## A review of root exudates and rhizosphere microbiome for crop production.
 25.08.2021, _H Sun, S Jiang, C Jiang, C Wu, M Gao, Q Wang_


Increasing crop yields and ensuring food security is a major global challenge. In order to increase crop production, chemical fertilizers and pesticides are excessively used. However, the significance of root exudates is understudied. Beneficial interactions between plant and rhizosphere microbiome are critical for plant fitness and health. In this review, we discuss the application and progress of current research methods and technologies in terms of root exudates and rhizosphere microbiome. We summarize how root exudates promote plant access to nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron, and how root exudates strengthen plant immunity to cope with biotic stress by regulating the rhizosphere microbiome, and thereby reducing dependence on fertilizers and pesticides. Optimizing these interactions to increase plant nutrient uptake and resistance to biotic stresses offers one of the few untapped opportunities to confront sustainability issues in food security. To overcome the limitations of current research, combination of multi-omics, imaging technology together with synthetic communities has the potential to uncover the interaction mechanisms and to fill the knowledge gap for their applications in agriculture to achieve sustainable development.

## The biodiversity effect of reduced tillage on soil microbiota.
 27.08.2021, _TG Frøslev, IB Nielsen, SS Santos, CJ Barnes, HH Bruun, R Ejrnæs_


The conversion of natural habitats into farmland has been a leading cause of species loss worldwide. Here, we investigated to what extent less intensive soil disturbance can mitigate this loss. Specifically, we examined whether reduced soil disturbance by tillage in agricultural fields could contribute to soil microbial biodiversity by providing a habitat for species that are limited by conventional tillage. To do so, we studied the diversity of soil biotas from three agricultural practices representing conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no tillage. Study fields were sampled by taking a bulk soil sample at the centre and edge of each field. The soil communities were recorded with environmental DNA metabarcoding using three molecular markers targeting bacteria, fungi and eukaryotes. While these three markers represent the vast majority of biotic variation in the soil, they will inevitably be dominated by the megadiverse microbiota of bacteria, microfungi and protists. We found a significant differentiation in community composition related to the intensity of tillage. Richness was weakly correlated to tillage, and more influenced by whether the sample was taken in the center or the edge of the field. Despite the significant effect of tillage on composition, comparisons with natural ecosystems revealed that all 30 study fields were much more similar in composition to other rotational fields than to more natural habitats, oldfields and leys. Despite a slightly higher similarity to oldfields and semi-natural grasslands, the contribution of no-till soil communities to biodiversity conservation is negligible, and our results indicate that restoration on set aside land may contribute more to conservation.

## Microbiome-mediated response to pulse fire disturbance outweighs the effects of fire legacy on plant performance.
 25.08.2021, _D Revillini, AS David, ES Menges, KN Main, ME Afkhami, CA Searcy_


Fire plays a major role in structuring plant communities across the globe. Interactions with soil microbes impact plant fitness, scaling up to influence plant populations and distributions. Here we present the first factorial manipulation of both fire and soil microbiome presence to investigate their interactive effects on plant performance across a suite of plant species with varying life history traits. We conducted fully-factorial experiments on each of 11 species from the Florida scrub ecosystem to test plant performance responses to soils with varying fire histories (36 soil sources), the presence/absence of a microbiome, and exposure to an experimental burn. Results revealed interactive 'pulse' effects between fire and the soil microbiome on plant performance. On average, post-fire soil microbiomes strongly reduced plant productivity compared to unburned or sterilized soils. Interestingly, longer-term fire 'legacy' effects had minor impacts on plant performance and were unrelated to soil microbiomes. While pulse fire effects on plant-microbiome interactions are short-term, they could have long-term consequences for plant communities by establishing differential microbiome-mediated priority effects during post-disturbance succession. The prominence of pulse fire effects on plant-microbe interactions has even greater import due to expected increases in fire disturbances resulting from anthropogenic climate change.

## Temporal and Spatial Signaling Mediating the Balance of the Plankton Microbiome.
 26.08.2021, _Y Deng, M Vallet, G Pohnert_


The annual patterns of plankton succession in the ocean determine ecological and biogeochemical cycles. The temporally fluctuating interplay between photosynthetic eukaryotes and the associated microbiota balances the composition of aquatic planktonic ecosystems. In addition to nutrients and abiotic factors, chemical signaling determines the outcome of interactions between phytoplankton and their associated microbiomes. Chemical mediators control essential processes, such as the development of key morphological, physiological, behavioral, and life-history traits during algal growth. These molecules thus impact species succession and community composition across time and space in processes that are highlighted in this review. We focus on spatial, seasonal, and physiological dynamics that occur during the early association of algae with bacteria, the exponential growth of a bloom, and also during its decline and recycling. We also discuss how patterns from field data and global surveys might be linked to the actions of metabolic markers in natural phytoplankton assemblages. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Marine Science, Volume 14 is January 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

## Benchmarking laboratory processes to characterise low-biomass respiratory microbiota.
 26.08.2021, _R Hasrat, J Kool, WAA de Steenhuijsen Piters, MLJN Chu, S Kuiling, JA Groot, EM van Logchem, S Fuentes, E Franz, D Bogaert, T Bosch_


The low biomass of respiratory samples makes it difficult to accurately characterise the microbial community composition. PCR conditions and contaminating microbial DNA can alter the biological profile. The objective of this study was to benchmark the currently available laboratory protocols to accurately analyse the microbial community of low biomass samples. To study the effect of PCR conditions on the microbial community profile, we amplified the 16S rRNA gene of respiratory samples using various bacterial loads and different number of PCR cycles. Libraries were purified by gel electrophoresis or AMPure XP and sequenced by V2 or V3 MiSeq reagent kits by Illumina sequencing. The positive control was diluted in different solvents. PCR conditions had no significant influence on the microbial community profile of low biomass samples. Purification methods and MiSeq reagent kits provided nearly similar microbiota profiles (paired Bray-Curtis dissimilarity median: 0.03 and 0.05, respectively). While profiles of positive controls were significantly influenced by the type of dilution solvent, the theoretical profile of the Zymo mock was most accurately analysed when the Zymo mock was diluted in elution buffer (difference compared to the theoretical Zymo mock: 21.6% for elution buffer, 29.2% for Milli-Q, and 79.6% for DNA/RNA shield). Microbiota profiles of DNA blanks formed a distinct cluster compared to low biomass samples, demonstrating that low biomass samples can accurately be distinguished from DNA blanks. In summary, to accurately characterise the microbial community composition we recommend 1. amplification of the obtained microbial DNA with 30 PCR cycles, 2. purifying amplicon pools by two consecutive AMPure XP steps and 3. sequence the pooled amplicons by V3 MiSeq reagent kit. The benchmarked standardized laboratory workflow presented here ensures comparability of results within and between low biomass microbiome studies.

## Simultaneous feature selection and outlier detection with optimality guarantees.
 26.08.2021, _L Insolia, A Kenney, F Chiaromonte, G Felici_


Biomedical research is increasingly data rich, with studies comprising ever growing numbers of features. The larger a study, the higher the likelihood that a substantial portion of the features may be redundant and/or contain contamination (outlying values). This poses serious challenges, which are exacerbated in cases where the sample sizes are relatively small. Effective and efficient approaches to perform sparse estimation in the presence of outliers are critical for these studies, and have received considerable attention in the last decade. We contribute to this area considering high-dimensional regressions contaminated by multiple mean-shift outliers affecting both the response and the design matrix. We develop a general framework and use mixed-integer programming to simultaneously perform feature selection and outlier detection with provably optimal guarantees. We prove theoretical properties for our approach, i.e., a necessary and sufficient condition for the robustly strong oracle property, where the number of features can increase exponentially with the sample size; the optimal estimation of parameters; and the breakdown point of the resulting estimates. Moreover, we provide computationally efficient procedures to tune integer constraints and warm-start the algorithm. We show the superior performance of our proposal compared to existing heuristic methods through simulations and use it to study the relationships between childhood obesity and the human microbiome.

## SMDI: An Index for Measuring Subgingival Microbial Dysbiosis.
 25.08.2021, _T Chen, PD Marsh, NN Al-Hebshi_


An intuitive, clinically relevant index of microbial dysbiosis as a summary statistic of subgingival microbiome profiles is needed. Here, we describe a subgingival microbial dysbiosis index (SMDI) based on machine learning analysis of published periodontitis/health 16S microbiome data. The raw sequencing data, split into training and test sets, were quality filtered, taxonomically assigned to the species level, and centered log-ratio transformed. The training data set was subject to random forest analysis to identify discriminating species (DS) between periodontitis and health. DS lists, compiled by various "Gini" importance score cutoffs, were used to compute the SMDI for samples in the training and test data sets as the mean centered log-ratio abundance of periodontitis-associated species subtracted by that of health-associated ones. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed with receiver operating characteristic analysis. An SMDI based on 49 DS provided the highest accuracy with areas under the curve of 0.96 and 0.92 in the training and test data sets, respectively, and ranged from -6 (most normobiotic) to 5 (most dysbiotic) with a value around zero discriminating most of the periodontitis and healthy samples. The top periodontitis-associated DS were Treponema denticola, Mogibacterium timidum, Fretibacterium spp., and Tannerella forsythia, while Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus sanguinis were the top health-associated DS. The index was highly reproducible by hypervariable region. Applying the index to additional test data sets in which nitrate had been used to modulate the microbiome demonstrated that nitrate has dysbiosis-lowering properties in vitro and in vivo. Finally, 3 genera (Treponema, Fretibacterium, and Actinomyces) were identified that could be used for calculation of a simplified SMDI with comparable accuracy. In conclusion, we have developed a nonbiased, reproducible, and easy-to-interpret index that can be used to identify patients/sites at risk of periodontitis, to assess the microbial response to treatment, and, importantly, as a quantitative tool in microbiome modulation studies.
