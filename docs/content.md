## Roles of the Polyphenol-Gut Microbiota Interaction in Alleviating Colitis and Preventing Colitis-Associated Colorectal Cancer.
 09.09.2020, _Y Zhao, Q Jiang_


Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota can promote or inhibit colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis. Promotion of beneficial gut bacteria is considered a promising strategy to alleviate colonic diseases including colitis and colorectal cancer. Interestingly, dietary polyphenols, which have been shown to attenuate colitis and inhibit colorectal cancer in animal models and some human studies, appear to reach relatively high concentrations in the large intestine and to interact with the gut microbial community. This review summarizes the modulatory effects of polyphenols on the gut microbiota in humans and animals under healthy and diseased conditions including colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Existing human and animal studies indicate that polyphenols and polyphenol-rich whole foods are capable of elevating butyrate producers and probiotics that alleviate colitis and inhibit CAC, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Studies in colitis and CAC models indicate that polyphenols decrease opportunistic pathogenic or proinflammatory microbes and counteract disease-induced dysbiosis. Consistently, polyphenols also change microbial functions, including increasing butyrate formation. Moreover, polyphenol metabolites produced by the gut microbiota appear to have anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities, protect gut barrier integrity, and mitigate inflammatory conditions in cells and animal models. Based on these results, we conclude that polyphenol-mediated alteration of microbial composition and functions, together with polyphenol metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, likely contribute to the protective effects of polyphenols on colitis and CAC. Future research is needed to validate the causal role of the polyphenol-gut microbiota interaction in polyphenols' anti-colitis and anti-CAC effects, and to further elucidate mechanisms underlying such interaction.

## Early Life Stress and the Development of the Infant Gut Microbiota: Implications for Mental Health and Neurocognitive Development.
 14.09.2020, _SC Vogel, NH Brito, BL Callaghan_


We review the state of the literature examining associations between early life stress (ELS), gut microbiota, and neurocognitive development and mental health in animals and humans. We identify gaps in current models and areas for future research.

## Maternal gut microbes shape the early-life assembly of gut microbiota in passerine chicks via nests.
 14.09.2020, _CY Chen, CK Chen, YY Chen, A Fang, GT Shaw, CM Hung, D Wang_


Knowledge is growing on how gut microbiota are established, but the effects of maternal symbiotic microbes throughout early microbial successions in birds remain elusive. In this study, we examined the contributions and transmission modes of maternal microbes into the neonatal microbiota of a passerine, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), based on fostering experiments.
