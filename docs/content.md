## Fast and flexible analysis of linked microbiome data with mako.
 10.12.2021, _L Röttjers, K Faust_


Mako is a software tool that converts microbiome data and networks into a graph database and visualizes query results, thus allowing users without programming knowledge to carry out network-based queries. Mako is accompanied by a database compiled from 60 microbiome studies that is easily extended with the user's own data. We illustrate mako's strengths by enumerating association partners linked to propionate production and comparing frequencies of different network motifs across habitat types.

Obesity and related comorbidities are major health concerns among many US immigrant populations. Emerging evidence suggests a potential involvement of the gut microbiome. Here, we evaluated gut microbiome features and their associations with immigration, dietary intake, and obesity in 2640 individuals from a population-based study of US Hispanics/Latinos.

## Signature changes in gut microbiome are associated with increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in MSM.

Men who have sex with men (MSM) have been disproportionately affected by HIV-1 since the beginning of the AIDS pandemic, particularly in the USA and Europe. Compared to men who have sex with women (MSW), MSM have a distinct fecal microbiome regardless of HIV-1 infection. However, it is unclear whether the MSM-associated gut microbiome affects the susceptibility and progression of HIV-1 infection. We studied fecal microbiome profiles, short-chain fatty acids, and blood plasma inflammatory cytokines of 109 HIV-1 seroconverters (SC) from the early, 1984-1985 phase of the HIV-1 pandemic in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) before and after HIV-1 infection compared to 156 HIV-1-negative MACS MSM (negative controls [NC]).

## Cognitive behavioral therapy for irritable bowel syndrome induces bidirectional alterations in the brain-gut-microbiome axis associated with gastrointestinal symptom improvement.

There is growing recognition that bidirectional signaling between the digestive tract and the brain contributes to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We recently showed in a large randomized controlled trial that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) reduces IBS symptom severity. This study investigated whether baseline brain and gut microbiome parameters predict CBT response and whether response is associated with changes in the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis.

## Impact of sleep on the microbiome of oral biofilms.
 12.12.2021, _M Sotozono, N Kuriki, Y Asahi, Y Noiri, M Hayashi, D Motooka, S Nakamura, M Yamaguchi, T Iida, S Ebisu_


Dysbiosis of the oral microbiome is associated with diseases such as periodontitis and dental caries. Because the bacterial counts in saliva increase markedly during sleep, it is broadly accepted that the mouth should be cleaned before sleep to help prevent these diseases. However, this practice does not consider oral biofilms, including the dental biofilm. This study aimed to investigate sleep-related changes in the microbiome of oral biofilms by using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Two experimental schedules-post-sleep and pre-sleep biofilm collection-were applied to 10 healthy subjects. Subjects had their teeth and oral mucosa professionally cleaned 7 days and 24 h before sample collection. Samples were collected from several locations in the oral cavity: the buccal mucosa, hard palate, tongue dorsum, gingival mucosa, tooth surface, and saliva. Prevotella and Corynebacterium had higher relative abundance on awakening than before sleep in all locations of the oral cavity, whereas fluctuations in Rothia levels differed depending on location. The microbiome in different locations in the oral cavity is affected by sleep, and changes in the microbiome composition depend on characteristics of the surfaces on which oral biofilms form.

## Functional screening of a human saliva metagenomic DNA reveal novel resistance genes against sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine.
 14.12.2021, _J Wigand, S Tansirichaiya, E Winje, M Al-Haroni_


Many sections of the health care system are facing a major challenge making infectious disease problematic to treat; antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Identification and surveillance of the resistome have been highlighted as one of the strategies to overcome the problem. This study aimed to screen for AMR genes in an oral microbiota, a complex microbial system continuously exposed to antimicrobial agents commonly used in dental practice.

## Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) in Airborne Particulate Matter (PM2.0) Emitted During Floor Waxing: A Pilot Study.
 13.12.2021, _J Zhou, K Baumann, N Chang, G Morrison, W Bodnar, Z Zhang, JM Atkin, JD Surratt, BJ Turpin_


Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), with their water- and heat-resistant properties, have been widely used in industrial and consumer products, including floor waxes. Adverse health effects are associated with PFAS exposures (e.g., increased risk of cancer and immunotoxicity); however, exposures resulting from the use of PFAS-containing products are poorly understood. This study examines PFAS emissions during professional floor stripping/waxing and their potential for occupational exposures. We measured PFASs in dust and airborne particulate matter (PM2.0, aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.0 μm) before, during, and after floor stripping/waxing activities in three rooms in a university building. PM2.0 samples were analyzed for 34 targeted PFASs by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UHPLC/ESI-MS/MS). In total, ten PFASs were detected in PM2.0 collected during floor waxing. Five were consistently higher during floor stripping/waxing compared to before (two with 95% confidence interval): perfluoro-2-methoxyacetic acid, perfluorobutanoic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid, perfluoroheptanoic acid, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid. For these five, estimated exposures during floor stripping were 80.6, 320.5, 83.8, 29.6, and 157.7 pg m-3 per hour of floor stripping, respectively, one order of magnitude greater than typical residential indoor and two orders of magnitude greater than ambient outdoor concentrations. Estimated emission rates were 3.0, 9.6, 3.4, 1.5, and 6.5 ng h-1m-2, respectively (34.6% uncertainty). Inhalation occupational exposures were in the range of 9.42-23.2 pg per kg body weight per hour of floor stripping across the five PFASs.

## Sexual dimorphism in glucose metabolism is shaped by androgen-driven gut microbiome.
 07.12.2021, _A Gao, J Su, R Liu, S Zhao, W Li, X Xu, D Li, J Shi, B Gu, J Zhang, Q Li, X Wang, Y Zhang, Y Xu, J Lu, G Ning, J Hong, Y Bi, W Gu, J Wang, W Wang_


Males are generally more susceptible to impaired glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes (T2D) than females. However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined. Here, we revealed that gut microbiome depletion abolished sexual dimorphism in glucose metabolism. The transfer of male donor microbiota into antibiotics-treated female mice led the recipients to be more insulin resistant. Depleting androgen via castration changed the gut microbiome of male mice to be more similar to that of females and improved glucose metabolism, while reintroducing dihydrotestosterone (DHT) reversed these alterations. More importantly, the effects of androgen on glucose metabolism were largely abolished when the gut microbiome was depleted. Next, we demonstrated that androgen modulated circulating glutamine and glutamine/glutamate (Gln/Glu) ratio partially depending on the gut microbiome, and glutamine supplementation increases insulin sensitivity in vitro. Our study identifies the effects of androgen in deteriorating glucose homeostasis partially by modulating the gut microbiome and circulating glutamine and Gln/Glu ratio, thereby contributing to the difference in glucose metabolism between the two sexes.
