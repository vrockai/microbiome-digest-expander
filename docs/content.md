Acid blockade is commonly prescribed in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Growing concerns, however, exist about its possible role in the pathophysiology of pulmonary infections. We aimed to investigate if acid blockade alters esophageal and respiratory microbiota leading to dysbiosis and inflammation.

## Immunotherapy in Solid Tumors and Gut Microbiota: The Correlation-A Special Reference to Colorectal Cancer.
 30.12.2020, _A Koulouridi, I Messaritakis, N Gouvas, J Tsiaoussis, J Souglakos_


Over the last few years, immunotherapy has been considered as a key player in the treatment of solid tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become the breakthrough treatment, with prolonged responses and improved survival results. ICIs use the immune system to defeat cancer by breaking the axes that allow tumors to escape immune surveillance. Innate and adaptive immunity are involved in mechanisms against tumor growth. The gut microbiome and its role in such mechanisms is a relatively new study field. The presence of a high microbial variation in the gut seems to be remarkably important for the efficacy of immunotherapy, interfering with innate immunity. Metabolic and immunity pathways are related with specific gut microbiota composition. Various studies have explored the composition of gut microbiota in correlation with the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients have gained little benefit from immunotherapy until now. Only mismatch repair-deficient/microsatellite-unstable tumors seem to respond positively to immunotherapy. However, gut microbiota could be the key to expanding the use of immunotherapy to a greater range of CRC patients.

## Analysis of the developing gut microbiota in young dairy calves-impact of colostrum microbiota and gut disturbances.
 30.12.2020, _BPT Hang, E Wredle, J Dicksved_


The aim of this study was to characterize the colostrum and fecal microbiota in calves and to investigate whether fecal microbiota composition was related to colostrum microbiota or factors associated with calf health. Colostrum samples were collected in buckets after hand milking of 76 calving cows from 38 smallholder dairy farms. Fecal samples were taken directly from the rectum of 76 calves at birth and at 14 days age. The bacterial community structure in colostrum and feces was analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism for all samples, and the microbial composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for a subset of the samples (8 colostrum, 40 fecal samples). There was a significant difference in fecal microbiota composition between day 0 and day 14 samples, but no associations between the microbiota and average daily gain, birth weight, or transfer of passive immunity. At 14 days of age, Faecalibacterium and Butyricicoccus were prevalent in higher relative abundances in the gut of healthy calves compared to calves with diarrhea that had been treated with antimicrobials. Colostrum showed great variation in composition of microbiota but no association to fecal microbiota. This study provides the first insights into the composition of colostrum and fecal microbiota of young dairy calves in southern Vietnam and can form the basis for future more detailed studies.

## Consistent patterns in 16S and 18S microbial diversity from the shells of the common and widespread red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta).
 28.12.2020, _M Parks, C Kedy, C Skalla_


Microbial communities associated with freshwater aquatic habitats and resident species are both critical to and indicative of ecosystem status and organismal health. External surfaces of turtle shells readily accumulate microbial growth and could carry representation of habitat-wide microbial diversity, since they are in regular contact with multiple elements of freshwater environments. Yet, microbial diversity residing on freshwater turtle shells is poorly understood. We applied 16S and 18S metabarcoding to characterize microbiota associated with external shell surfaces of 20 red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta) turtles collected from varied habitats in central and western Oklahoma, and ranging to southeast Iowa. Shell-associated microbial communities were highly diverse, with samples dominated by Bacteroidia and alpha-/gamma-proteobacteria, and ciliophoran alveolates. Alpha diversity was lower on turtle shells compared to shallow-water-associated environmental samples, likely resulting from basking-drying behavior and seasonal scute shedding, while alpha diversity was higher on carapace than plastron surfaces. Beta diversity of turtle shells was similarly differentiated from environmental samples, although sampling site was consistently a significant factor. Deinococcus-Thermus bacteria and ciliophoran alveolates were recovered with significantly higher abundance on turtle shells versus environmental samples, while bacterial taxa known to include human-pathogenic species were variably more abundant between shell and environmental samples. Microbial communities from a single, shared-site collection of the ecologically similar river cooter (P. concinna) largely overlapped with those of T. scripta. These data add to a foundation for further characterization of turtle shell microbial communities across species and habitats, with implications for freshwater habitat assessment, microbial ecology and wildlife conservation efforts.

## Archaeal communities of low and high microbial abundance sponges inhabiting the remote western Indian Ocean island of Mayotte.
 28.12.2020, _ARM Pol√≥nia, DFR Cleary, A Gauvin-Bialecki, NJ de Voogd_


Marine sponges are abundant and ecologically important components of coral reefs and have been shown to harbour exceptionally high microbial densities, which can differ substantially among sponge species. However, this dichotomy between high and low microbial abundance (HMA, LMA) sponges is still not fully understood, particularly as concerns the archaeal community. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing (using 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene) how the archaeal community varies among known LMA (Stylissa carteri, and Stylissa massa), known HMA (Hyrtios erectus and Xestospongia testudinaria) and unknown HMA/LMA status sponge species (Ectyoplasia coccinea, Paratetilla bacca and Petrosia aff. spheroida) collected in a remote location in which very few sponge microbial composition studies have been previously performed (Mayotte, Comores archipelago, France) and comparing the results with those reported in four other geographical areas. Based on archaeal community composition, the known LMA sponges formed a distinct cluster together with Paratetilla bacca, Ectyoplasia coccinea and seawater while the known HMA sponge X. testudinaria formed a cluster with Petrosia aff. spheroida. The known HMA sponge H. erectus, in turn, had an intermediate archaeal community between HMA sponges and sediment samples. In addition to the above, we also showed significant compositional congruence between archaeal and bacterial communities sampled from the same sponge individuals. HMA sponges were mainly dominated by members assigned to the genus Nitrosopumilus while LMA sponges were mainly dominated by members assigned to the genus Cenarchaeum. In general, there was no clear difference in richness between HMA and LMA sponges. Evenness, however, was higher in HMA than LMA sponges. Whilst the present study corroborates some of the traits commonly associated with the HMA-LMA dichotomy (higher evenness in Mayotte HMA sponges), this was not consistent across geographical areas showing that more research is needed to fully understand the HMA/LMA dichotomy as concerns Archaea.
