Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. AD involves major pathologies such as amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. During the progression of AD, microglia can be polarized from anti-inflammatory M2 to pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. The activation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) may result in microglia phenotype switching from M1 to M2, which finally attenuated Aβ deposition and memory loss in AD. Low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) is known to ameliorate Aβ pathology and cognitive deficits in AD; however, the therapeutic mechanisms of LDIR against AD-related pathology have been little studied. First, we reconfirm that LDIR (two Gy per fraction for five times)-treated six-month 5XFAD mice exhibited (1) the reduction of Aβ deposition, as reflected by thioflavins S staining, and (2) the improvement of cognitive deficits, as revealed by Morris water maze test, compared to sham-exposed 5XFAD mice. To elucidate the mechanisms of LDIR-induced inhibition of Aβ accumulation and memory loss in AD, we examined whether LDIR regulates the microglial phenotype through the examination of levels of M1 and M2 cytokines in 5XFAD mice. In addition, we investigated the direct effects of LDIR on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production and secretion of M1/M2 cytokines in the BV-2 microglial cells. In the LPS- and LDIR-treated BV-2 cells, the M2 phenotypic marker CD206 was significantly increased, compared with LPS- and sham-treated BV-2 cells. Finally, the effect of LDIR on M2 polarization was confirmed by detection of increased expression of TREM2 in LPS-induced BV2 cells. These results suggest that LDIR directly induced phenotype switching from M1 to M2 in the brain with AD. Taken together, our results indicated that LDIR modulates LPS- and Aβ-induced neuroinflammation by promoting M2 polarization via TREM2 expression, and has beneficial effects in the AD-related pathology such as Aβ deposition and memory loss.

While the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris enables the industrial-scale biosynthesis of many recombinant products, large amount of nutrient-rich biomass emerged along this process. Polysaccharides, especially glucans that are abundant in the cell wall of P. pastoris, are yet to be better utilized owing to their various biological activities. However, the isolation and purification of cell wall glucan from P. pastoris has not been reported. In this study, we established an environment-friendly approach, including induced autolysis, hot-water treatment, ultrasonication, isopropanol extraction, and protease treatment, to isolate and purify glucan from the cell wall of P. pastoris. We achieved a purity of 85.3% and a yield of 11.7% for the purified glucan. Proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and ash were efficiently removed during the purification. The activities of the purified glucan were investigated in mice fed with a high-fat diet. The purified glucan decreased the level of total cholesterol and triglycerides by 30.3 and 29.7%, respectively. This result suggested that the cell wall glucan of P. pastoris could be developed to a therapeutic agent for dyslipidemia. Our study proposed an environment-friendly and effective method to isolate and purify the glucan from P. pastoris, providing solid foundation for the high-value utilization of this yeast.

Recent studies describe the use of UAVs in collecting blow samples from large whales to analyze the microbial and viral community in exhaled air. Unfortunately, attempts to collect blow from small cetaceans have not been successful due to their swimming and diving behavior. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study we investigated the application of a specific sampling tool attached to a UAV to analyze the blow from small cetaceans and their respiratory microbiome. Preliminary trials to set up the sampling tool were conducted on a group of 6 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under human care, housed at Acquario di Genova, with approximately 1 meter distance between the blowing animal and the tool to obtain suitable samples. The same sampling kit, suspended via a 2 meter rope assembled on a waterproof UAV, flying 3 meters above the animals, was used to sample the blows of 5 wild bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Ambracia (Greece) and a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), to investigate whether this experimental assembly also works for large whale sampling. In order to distinguish between blow-associated microbes and seawater microbes, we pooled 5 seawater samples from the same area where blow samples' collection were carried out. The the respiratory microbiota was assessed by using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene via Illumina Amplicon Sequencing. The pooled water samples contained more bacterial taxa than the blow samples of both wild animals and the sequenced dolphin maintained under human care. The composition of the bacterial community differed between the water samples and between the blow samples of wild cetaceans and that under human care, but these differences may have been mediated by different microbial communities between seawater and aquarium water. The sperm whale's respiratory microbiome was more similar to the results obtained from wild bottlenose dolphins. Although the number of samples used in this study was limited and sampling and analyses were impaired by several limitations, the results are rather encouraging, as shown by the evident microbial differences between seawater and blow samples, confirmed also by the meta-analysis carried out comparing our results with those obtained in previous studies. Collecting exhaled air from small cetaceans using drones is a challenging process, both logistically and technically. The success in obtaining samples from small cetacean blow in this study in comparison to previous studies is likely due to the distance the sampling kit is suspended from the drone, which reduced the likelihood that the turbulence of the drone propeller interfered with successfully sampling blow, suggested as a factor leading to poor success in previous studies.

## Analysis of Risk Factors for Postoperative Infection and Neurological Complications in Patients with Acute Stanford A AD According to CT angiography Information.
 05.07.2020, _S Zang, Y Zhang, J Xu, Y Du_


The objective of this study was to explore the risk factors of postoperative infection and cerebral neurological complications in patients with acute Stanford A aortic dissection based on the CT angiography information. 122 patients who were diagnosed as Stanford A ADs by computed tomography (CT) angiography and were treated with Sun's surgery from March 2017 to December 2019 in our hospital were selected in this study. Based on infections and neurological complications after surgery of the patients, they were divided into four groups: no postoperative complications (group A), postoperative infections (group B), postoperative neurological complications (group C), postoperative infection and neurological complications (group D). Previous medical history, creatinine value, surgery duration, intraoperative blood transfusion, intensive care unit (ICU) residence duration, drainage tube retention duration, and tracheotomy of the patients were recorded and analyzed. The single factor analysis was taken for factors related to infection and neurological complications after surgery, and the multiple logistic regression analysis was further taken if there was any statistical difference. The results showed that the blood creatinine value and age of patients in group A were significantly lower than those in group B, C, and D (P &lt; 0.05); the total surgery duration, extracorporeal circulation duration, and blocking duration in patients in group C and D were significantly higher than those in other groups (P &lt; 0.05); postoperative plasma transfusion volume, platelet volume, and ICU residence duration in group A were significantly different from the other three groups (P &lt; 0.05). There was no difference in the percentage of patients transferred to the ICU for multiple times, and drainage tube retention duration of patients in four groups (P &gt; 0.05). The nasal feeding tube retention duration, the auxiliary ventilation duration, and the percentages of patients with multiple intubations, tracheotomies, and continuous renal replacement therapy in group B and D were significantly different from those in the other two groups (P &lt; 0.05). Age, blood creatinine, total surgery duration, and ICU residence duration were significantly correlated with infection and neurological complications after Stanford A AD based on the single factor logistic analysis (P &lt; 0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the plasma transfusion volume, auxiliary ventilation duration, extracorporeal circulation duration, and ICU residence duration were significantly related to postoperative infection and neurological complications (P &lt; 0.05). It indicated that the plasma transfusion volume, auxiliary ventilation duration, extracorporeal circulation duration, and the ICU residence duration are independent risk factors of the infection and neurological complications after Stanford A AD. The occurrence of postoperative infection and neurological complications can be reduced by control related parameters during the surgery.

Epidemiological and animal studies have indicated an inverse correlation between the rising prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome and exposure to helminths. Whether helminth-induced immune response contributes to microbiota remodeling in obesity remains unknown. The aim of this study is to explore the immune-regulatory role of helminth in the prevention of HFD-induced obesity through remodeling gut microbiome.

## Microbiome and health implications for ethnic minorities after enforced lifestyle changes.
 07.07.2020, _DM Keohane, TS Ghosh, IB Jeffery, MG Molloy, PW O'Toole, F Shanahan_


Modern lifestyles increase the risk of chronic diseases, in part by modifying the microbiome, but the health effects of lifestyles enforced on ethnic minorities are understudied1-3. Lifestyle affects the microbiome early in life, when the microbiome is assembled and the immune system is undergoing maturation4-6. Moreover, the influence of lifestyle has been separated from genetic and geographic factors by studies of genetically similar populations and ethnically distinct groups living in the same geographic location7-11. The lifestyle of Irish Travellers, an ethnically distinct subpopulation, changed with legislation in 2002 that effectively ended nomadism and altered their living conditions. Comparative metagenomics of gut microbiomes shows that Irish Travellers retain a microbiota similar to that of non-industrialized societies. Their microbiota is associated with non-dietary factors and is proportionately linked with risk of microbiome-related metabolic disease. Our findings suggest there are microbiome-related public health implications when ethnic minorities are pressured to change lifestyles.

Dietary glycans, widely used as food ingredients and not directly digested by humans, are of intense interest for their beneficial roles in human health through shaping the microbiome. Characterizing the consistency and temporal responses of the gut microbiome to glycans is critical for rationally developing and deploying these compounds as therapeutics.
