## Multi-omic interactions in the gut of children at the onset of islet autoimmunity.
 19.12.2022, _PG Gavin, KW Kim, ME Craig, MM Hill, EE Hamilton-Williams_


The gastrointestinal ecosystem is a highly complex environment with a profound influence on human health. Inflammation in the gut, linked to an altered gut microbiome, has been associated with the development of multiple human conditions including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Viruses infecting the gastrointestinal tract, especially enteroviruses, are also thought to play an important role in T1D pathogenesis possibly via overlapping mechanisms. However, it is not known whether the microbiome and virome act together or which risk factor may be of greater importance at the time when islet autoimmunity is initiated.

## The microbiota-gut-brain axis in pathogenesis of depression: A narrative review.
 19.12.2022, _H Yao, D Zhang, H Yu, H Shen, H Liu, F Meng, X Wu, G Zhang, X Wang_


The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional regulatory pathway between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract, which plays an important role in maintain homeostasis. Gut microbiota could influence the behavior, cognition, stress response and others via the axis. Depression is a complex psychiatric disease, giving rise to heavy social health and economic burden. In recent years, studies have shown that the gut microbiota are closely linked to the pathophysiological processes of depression. In this article, the interaction and its underlying mechanisms between depression and gut microbiota were summarized.

## Environmental enteric dysfunction: gut and microbiota adaptation in pregnancy and infancy.
 16.12.2022, _CA Cowardin, S Syed, N Iqbal, Z Jamil, K Sadiq, J Iqbal, SA Ali, SR Moore_


Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a subclinical syndrome of intestinal inflammation, malabsorption and barrier disruption that is highly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries in which poverty, food insecurity and frequent exposure to enteric pathogens impair growth, immunity and neurodevelopment in children. In this Review, we discuss advances in our understanding of EED, intestinal adaptation and the gut microbiome over the 'first 1,000 days' of life, spanning pregnancy and early childhood. Data on maternal EED are emerging, and they mirror earlier findings of increased risks for preterm birth and fetal growth restriction in mothers with either active inflammatory bowel disease or coeliac disease. The intense metabolic demands of pregnancy and lactation drive gut adaptation, including dramatic changes in the composition, function and mother-to-child transmission of the gut microbiota. We urgently need to elucidate the mechanisms by which EED undermines these critical processes so that we can improve global strategies to prevent and reverse intergenerational cycles of undernutrition.

## Gastrointestinal Tract, Microbiota and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and the Link Between Gut Microbiota and CNS.
 19.12.2022, _B Yousefi, A Babaeizad, SZ Banihashemian, ZK Feyzabadi, M Dadashpour, D Pahlevan, H Ghaffari, M Eslami_


Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by central nervous system (CNS) lesions that can lead to severe neurological defects. Evidence is mounting that immune function is crucial in neuroinflammatory illnesses like MS. Through its impact on systemic immunological reactions, the large microbial population known as the gut microbiota has been linked to both human health and disease. The gut-brain axis (GBA) therefore encompasses neurological, immunological, and hormonal pathways, and microbiota can have a number of effects on the immune system, influencing MS. Recent research revealed a bidirectional relationship between metabolites originating from the gut microbiota, namely short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Intestinal epithelial cells are influenced by SCFAs, which also boosts the secretion of -Defensins and regenerating islet-derived III (REGIII) proteins. These proteins reduce intestinal pathogens, induce T-reg differentiation, and modulate immune responses by reducing IL-1 and IL-6 expression and increasing IL-10. Nutrition and psychological stress are two of the most significant elements that can directly and indirectly change the microbiota compositions along with other environmental influencing factors. An important regulator of intestinal physiology in the gut-brain-microbiota axis is butyrate, a well-known SCFA. Intestinal dysbiosis, altered intestinal barrier function, behavioral abnormalities, and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are all brought on by exposure. Probiotics, bacterial metabolite supplementation, fecal matter transplantation, defined microbial communities, and dietary intervention are some methods for modifying the composition of the gut microbiota that may be used to affect disease-related immune dysfunction and serve as the foundation for a new class of therapeutics.

## Effect of proton pump inhibitors in infants with esophageal atresia on the gut microbiome: a pilot cohort.
 19.12.2022, _N Brusselaers, M Pereira, J Alm, L Engstrand, H Engstrand Lilja_


The effects of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) on the infant microbiome remain unclear. Swedish pilot cohort study to assess the longitudinal effect of long-term PPI on the infant gut microbiome, including ten newborn infants operated for esophageal atresia exposed to PPIs (mean 57 weeks), compared to healthy one-year-old controls. All children were born vaginally and were otherwise healthy. Within- and between sample diversity of the fecal microbiome was assessed using untargeted whole genome Shotgun metagenomics which sequences all the DNA in the sample and can capture genes rather than a taxonomic fingerprint.

Apical periodontitis (AP) represents an inflammatory condition of peri-radicular tissues due to invasion and colonization of bacteria in the root canals. Primary AP (PAP) is associated with untreated necrotic root canal and can be efficiently treated with endodontic treatment to remove bacteria. Persistent/secondary AP (SAP) is a perpetual periapical lesion due to unsuccessfully treated root canals after an initial apparent healing of the tooth. The aim of the study was evaluating the microbial communities associated with root canals using Nanopore sequencing.

## Midgut Bacterial Microbiota of 12 Fish Species from a Marine Protected Area in the Aegean Sea (Greece).
 18.12.2022, _K Kormas, E Nikouli, V Kousteni, D Damalas_


Fish microbiome science is progressing fast, but it is biased toward farmed or laboratory fish species against natural fish populations, which remain considerably underinvestigated. We analyzed the midgut bacterial microbiota of 45 specimens of 12 fish species collected from the Gyaros Island marine protected area (Aegean Sea, Greece). The species belong to seven taxonomic families and are either herbivores or omnivores. Mucosa midgut bacterial diversity was assessed by amplicon metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 gene region. A total of 854 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified. In each fish species, between 2 and 18 OTUs dominated with cumulative relative abundance ≥ 70%. Most of the dominating bacterial taxa have been reported to occur both in wild and farmed fish populations. The midgut bacterial communities were different among the 12 fish species, except for Pagrus pagrus and Pagellus erythrinus, which belong to the Sparidae family. No differentiation of the midgut bacterial microbiota was found based on feeding habits, i.e., omnivorous vs. carnivorous. Comparing wild and farmed P. pagrus midgut bacterial microbiota revealed considerable variation between them. Our results expand the gut microbiota of wild fish and support the host species effect as the more likely factor shaping intestinal bacterial microbiota.

## Multifaceted roles of flavonoids mediating plant-microbe interactions.
 19.12.2022, _L Wang, M Chen, PY Lam, F Dini-Andreote, L Dai, Z Wei_


Plant-microbe interactions dynamically affect plant growth, health, and development. The mechanisms underpinning these associations are-to a large extent-mediated by specialized host-derived secondary metabolites. Flavonoids are one of the most studied classes of such metabolites, regulating both plant development and the interaction with commensal microbes. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the multiple roles of flavonoids in mediating plant-microbe interactions. First, we briefly summarize the general aspects of flavonoid synthesis, transport, and exudation in plants. Then, we review the importance of flavonoids regulating plant-microbe interactions and dynamically influencing the overall community assembly of plant-root microbiomes. Last, we highlight potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how flavonoids determine the interactions between plants and commensal microbes. Collectively, we advocate the importance of advancing research in this area toward innovative strategies to effectively manipulate plant-microbiome composition, in this case, via flavonoid production and exudation in plant roots.

## An economic and robust TMT labeling approach for high throughput proteomic and metaproteomic analysis.
 18.12.2022, _M Creskey, L Li, Z Ning, EE Brown, J Mayne, K Walker, A Ampaw, R Ben, X Zhang, D Figeys_


Multiplexed quantitative proteomics using tandem mass tag (TMT) is increasingly used in -omic study of complex samples. While TMT-based proteomics has the advantages of the higher quantitative accuracy, fewer missing values, and reduced instrument analysis time, it is limited by the additional reagent cost. In addition, current TMT labeling workflows involve repeated small volume pipetting of reagents in volatile solvents, which may increase the sample-to-sample variations and is not readily suitable for high throughput applications. In this study, we demonstrated that the TMT labeling procedures could be streamlined by using pre-aliquoted dry TMT reagents in a 96 well plate or 12-tube strip. As little as 50 μg dry TMT per channel was used to label 6-12 μg peptides, yielding high TMT labeling efficiency (∼99%) in both microbiome and mammalian cell line samples. We applied this workflow to analyze 97 samples in a study to evaluate whether ice recrystallization inhibitors improve the cultivability and activity of frozen microbiota. The results demonstrated tight sample clustering corresponding to groups and consistent microbiome responses to prebiotic treatments. This study supports the use of TMT reagents that are pre-aliquoted, dried, and stored for robust quantitative proteomics and metaproteomics in high throughput applications.

## Machine learning-derived gut microbiome signature predicts fatty liver disease in the presence of insulin resistance.
 19.12.2022, _BE Kang, A Park, H Yang, Y Jo, TG Oh, SM Jeong, Y Ji, HL Kim, HN Kim, J Auwerx, S Nam, CY Park, D Ryu_


A simple predictive biomarker for fatty liver disease is required for individuals with insulin resistance. Here, we developed a supervised machine learning-based classifier for fatty liver disease using fecal 16S rDNA sequencing data. Based on the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital cohort (n = 777), we generated a random forest classifier to predict fatty liver diseases in individuals with or without insulin resistance (n = 166 and n = 611, respectively). The model performance was evaluated based on metrics, including accuracy, area under receiver operating curve (AUROC), kappa, and F1-score. The developed classifier for fatty liver diseases performed better in individuals with insulin resistance (AUROC = 0.77). We further optimized the classifiers using genetic algorithm. The improved classifier for insulin resistance, consisting of ten microbial genera, presented an advanced classification (AUROC = 0.93), whereas the improved classifier for insulin-sensitive individuals failed to distinguish participants with fatty liver diseases from the healthy. The classifier for individuals with insulin resistance was comparable or superior to previous methods predicting fatty liver diseases (accuracy = 0.83, kappa = 0.50, F1-score = 0.89), such as the fatty liver index. We identified the ten genera as a core set from the human gut microbiome, which could be a diagnostic biomarker of fatty liver diseases for insulin resistant individuals. Collectively, these findings indicate that the machine learning classifier for fatty liver diseases in the presence of insulin resistance is comparable or superior to commonly used methods.

## Dynamics of the Gut Bacteriome During a Laboratory Adaptation Process of the Mediterranean Fruit Fly, Ceratitis capitata.
 19.07.2022, _N Bel Mokhtar, M Catalá-Oltra, P Stathopoulou, E Asimakis, I Remmal, N Remmas, A Maurady, MR Britel, J García de Oteyza, G Tsiamis, Ó Dembilio_


Laboratory adaptation process used in sterile insect technique (SIT) programs can exert a significant impact on the insect-gut microbiome relationship, which may negatively impact the quality and performance of the fly. In the present study, changes in the gut microbiota that occur through laboratory adaptation of two Ceratitis capitata populations were investigated: Vienna 8 genetic sexing strain (GSS), a long-established control line, and a wild population recently introduced to laboratory conditions. The bacterial profiles were studied for both strains using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 hypervariable region in larvae and in the gastrointestinal tract of teneral (1 day) and adults (5 and 15 days) reared under laboratory conditions for 14 generations (F0-F13). Findings demonstrated the development of distinct bacterial communities across the generations with differences in the bacterial composition, suggesting a strong impact of laboratory adaptation on the fly bacteriome. Moreover, different bacterial profiles were observed between wild and Vienna 8 FD-GSS displaying different patterns between the developmental stages. Proteobacteria, mainly members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, represented the major component of the bacterial community followed by Firmicutes (mainly in Vienna 8 FD-GSS adults) and Chlamydiae. The distribution of these communities is dynamic across the generations and seems to be strain- and age-specific. In the Vienna 8 FD-GSS population, Providencia exhibited high relative abundance in the first three generations and decreased significantly later, while Klebsiella was relatively stable. In the wild population, Klebsiella was dominant across most of the generations, indicating that the wild population was more resistant to artificial rearing conditions compared with the Vienna 8 FD-GSS colony. Analysis of the core bacteriome revealed the presence of nine shared taxa between most of the examined medfly samples including Klebsiella, Providencia, Pantoea, and Pseudomonas. In addition, the operational taxonomic unit co-occurrence and mutual exclusion networks of the wild population indicated that most of the interactions were classified as co-presence, while in the Vienna 8 FD-GSS population, the number of mutual exclusions and co-presence interactions was equally distributed. Obtained results provided a thorough study of the dynamics of gut-associated bacteria during the laboratory adaptation of different Ceratitis capitata populations, serving as guidance for the design of colonization protocols, improving the effectiveness of artificial rearing and the SIT application.
