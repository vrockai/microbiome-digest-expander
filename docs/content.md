## VALENCIA: a nearest centroid classification method for vaginal microbial communities based on composition.
 24.11.2020, _MT France, B Ma, P Gajer, S Brown, MS Humphrys, JB Holm, LE Waetjen, RM Brotman, J Ravel_


Taxonomic profiles of vaginal microbial communities can be sorted into a discrete number of categories termed community state types (CSTs). This approach is advantageous because collapsing a hyper-dimensional taxonomic profile into a single categorical variable enables efforts such as data exploration, epidemiological studies, and statistical modeling. Vaginal communities are typically assigned to CSTs based on the results of hierarchical clustering of the pairwise distances between samples. However, this approach is problematic because it complicates between-study comparisons and because the results are entirely dependent on the particular set of samples that were analyzed. We sought to standardize and advance the assignment of samples to CSTs.

## Non-pharmacological Strategies Against Systemic Inflammation: Molecular Basis and Clinical Evidence.
 08.08.2020, _R Pinto, D Pietropaoli, A Monaco, G Desideri, C Ferri, D Grassi_


Systemic inflammation is a common denominator to a variety of cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV diseases and relative risk factors, including hypertension and its control, metabolic diseases, rheumatic disorders, and those affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Besides medications, a non-pharmacological approach encompassing lifestyle changes and other complementary measures is mentioned in several updated guidelines on the management of these conditions. We performed an updated narrative review on the mechanisms behind the systemic impact of inflammation and the role of non-pharmacological, complementary measures centered on lowering systemic phlogosis for preserving or restoring a good global health. The central role of genetics in shaping the immune response is discussed in conjunction with that of the microbiome, highlighting the interdependence and mutual influences between the human genome and microbial integrity, diversity, and functions. Several plausible strategies to modulate inflammation and restore balanced crosstalk between the human genome and the microbiome are then recapitulated, including dietary measures, active lifestyle, and other potential approaches to manipulate the resident microbial community. To date, evidence from high-quality human studies is sparse to allow the unconditioned inclusion of understudied, though plausible solutions against inflammation into public health strategies for global wellness. This gap claims further focused, well-designed research targeted at unravelling the mechanisms behind future personalized medicine.

## Dietary probiotic and metabolites improve intestinal homeostasis and prevent colorectal cancer.
 24.11.2020, _M Peng, SH Lee, SO Rahaman, D Biswas_


The excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, uncontrolled cell proliferation, and dysbiosis in gut intestinal microbiota are involved in tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer. Probiotics secrete various functional metabolites that maintain intestinal microflora balance and improve the host's gut health. This study defines the roles of dietary Lactobacillus (LC-CLA) metabolites, especially conjugated linoleic acids (CLA), in intestinal homeostasis. Based on cellular and transcriptional examination, LC-CLA cell free cultural supernatant (CFCS) significantly inhibited the viability of colorectal cancer cells (HCT-116). CFCSs containing various levels of CLA also significantly lowered the transcript levels of crucial genes for tumorous cell growth and proliferation, such as CDK1/2/6, PLK1, and SKP2. Furthermore, LC-CLA and its CFCS exhibited substantial free radical scavenging activities as well as downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine and upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokine gene expressions. In addition, daily consumption of LC-CLA for one week modulated the composition of gut microflora by specifically reducing the relative abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria in mice. These findings reveal the potential application of CLA from probiotic origin as a dietary supplement or nutraceutical agent for improving gastrointestinal health and preventing colorectal cancer.

## The synergistic tumor growth-inhibitory effect of probiotic Lactobacillus on transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine.
 24.11.2020, _SM Chen, WW Chieng, SW Huang, LJ Hsu, MS Jan_


Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal and chemo-resistant cancers worldwide. Growing evidence supports the theory that the gut microbiota plays an essential role in modulating the host response to anti-cancer therapy. The present study aimed to explore the effect of probiotics as an adjuvant during chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. An LSL-KrasG12D/--Pdx-1-Cre mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was created to study the effects of using four-week multi-strain probiotics (Lactobacillus paracasei GMNL-133 and Lactobacillus reuteri GMNL-89) as an adjuvant therapy for controlling cancer progression. At 12 weeks of age, pancreatitis was induced in the mice by two intraperitoneal injection with caerulein (25 μg/kg 2 days apart). Over the next 4 weeks the mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of gemcitabine in combination with the oral administration of probiotics. The pancreas was then harvested for analysis. Following caerulein treatment, the pancreases of the LSL-KrasG12D/--Pdx-1-Cre transgenic mice exhibited more extensive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) formation. Combined treatment with gemcitabine and probiotics revealed a lower grade of PanIN formation and a decrease in the expression of vimentin and Ki-67. Mice that received gemcitabine in combination with probiotics had lower aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Notably, the use of high-dose probiotics alone without gemcitabine also had an inhibitory effect on PanIN changes and serum liver enzyme elevation. These findings suggest that probiotics are able to make standard chemotherapy more effective and could help improve the patient's tolerance of chemotherapy.

The silkworm Bombyx mori (B. mori) is an important domesticated lepidopteran model for basic and applied research. They produce silk fibres that have great economic value. The gut microbiome plays an important role in the growth of organisms. Spermidine (Spd) is shown to be important for the growth of all living cells. The effect of spermidine feeding on the gut microbiome of 5th instar B. mori larvae was checked. The B. mori gut samples from control and spermidine fed larvae were subjected to next-generation sequencing analysis to unravel changes in the bacterial community upon spermidine supplementation.

## Host plant diet affects growth and induces altered gene expression and microbiome composition in the wood white (Leptidea sinapis) butterfly.
 21.11.2020, _K Näsvall, C Wiklund, V Mrazek, A Künstner, V Talla, H Busch, R Vila, N Backström_


In a time with decreasing biodiversity, especially among insects, a detailed understanding about specific resource utilization strategies is crucial. The physiological and behavioural responses to host switches in phytophagous insects are poorly understood. Earlier studies indicate that a host plant switch might be associated with distinctive molecular and physiological responses in different lineages. Expanding the assessment of such associations across Lepidoptera will reveal if there are general patterns in adaptive responses or if each switch event is more of a unique character. We investigated host plant preference, fitness consequences, effects on expression profiles and gut microbiome composition in two common wood white (Leptidea sinapis) populations with different host plant preferences from the extremes of the species distribution area (Sweden and Catalonia). Our results show that female Catalonian wood whites lack preference for either host plant (Lotus corniculatus or L. dorycnium), while Swedish females laid significantly more eggs on L. corniculatus. Individuals from both populations reared on L. dorycnium had longer developmental times and smaller body size as adults. This indicates that both environmental and genetic factors determine the choice to use a specific host plant. Gene expression analysis revealed a more pronounced response to host plant in the Catalonian compared to the Swedish population. In addition, host plant treatment resulted in a significant shift in microbiome community structure in the Catalonian population. Together, this suggests that population specific plasticity associated with local conditions underlies host plant utilisation in wood whites.

## Effect of sterilization on the canine vaginal microbiota: a pilot study.
 24.11.2020, _A Rota, M Corrò, I Patuzzi, C Milani, S Masia, E Mastrorilli, S Petrin, A Longo, A Del Carro, C Losasso_


Surgical sterilization is the most effective method of contraception for dogs. It also prevents pyometra and reduces the risk of mammary tumour development. However, this procedure also has negative effects, such as urinary incontinence. Steroid hormone deprivation following gonadectomy could also affect canine vaginal mucosa conditions and the microbial community colonizing the vaginal tract. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the vaginal cytology and microbial community of two groups of bitches, including 11 in anoestrus and 10 sterilized bitches (post-pubertal sterilization in the last 4 years). Bacteria were identified through metataxonomic analysis, amplifying the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene, and culturing methods.

## Bacterial dispersal and drift drive microbiome diversity patterns within a population of feral hindgut fermenters.
 24.11.2020, _MR Stothart, RJ Greuel, S Gavriliuc, A Henry, AJ Wilson, PD McLoughlin, J Poissant_


Studies of microbiome variation in wildlife often emphasize host physiology and diet as proximate selective pressures acting on host-associated microbiota. In contrast, microbial dispersal and ecological drift are more rarely considered. Using amplicon sequencing, we characterized the bacterial microbiome of adult female (n = 86) Sable Island horses (Nova Scotia, Canada) as part of a detailed individual-based study of this feral population. Using data on sampling date, horse location, age, parental status, and local habitat variables, we contrasted the ability of spatiotemporal, life history, and environmental factors to explain microbiome diversity among Sable Island horses. We extended inferences made from these analyses with both phylogeny-informed and phylogeny-independent null modeling approaches to identify deviations from stochastic expectations. Phylogeny-informed diversity measures were correlated with spatial and local habitat variables, but null modelling results suggested that heterogeneity in ecological drift, rather than differential selective pressures acting on the microbiome, was responsible for these correlations. Conversely, phylogeny-independent diversity measures were best explained by host spatial and social structure, suggesting that taxonomic composition of the microbiome was shaped most strongly by bacterial dispersal. Parental status was important but correlated with measures of β-dispersion rather than β-diversity (mares without foals had lower alpha diversity and more variable microbiomes than mares with foals). Our results suggest that between host microbiome variation within the Sable Island horse population is driven more strongly by bacterial dispersal and ecological drift than by differential selective pressures. These results emphasize the need to consider alternative ecological processes in the study of microbiomes.

## Microbiome-Metabolomic Analyses of the Impacts of Dietary Stachyose on Fecal Microbiota and Metabolites in Infants Intestinal Microbiota-associated Mice.
 22.11.2020, _M Xi, H Tang, Y Zhang, W Ge, Y Chen, X Cui_


The intestinal microbiota and metabolites play an important role in human health and immunity. However, few studies have investigated the long-term effects of stachyose on the human intestinal microbiota and metabolism. Therefore, in this study, the feces of infants were transplanted into germ-free mice, and the effect of long-term stachyose intake on intestinal metabolism was examined by comparing the results of microbiome and metabolome analyses. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was used to study the effects of stachyose intake on the metabolites and metabolic pathways of the transplanted human intestinal microbiota.

## MetaGeneHunt for protein domain annotation in short-read metagenomes.

The annotation of short-reads metagenomes is an essential process to understand the functional potential of sequenced microbial communities. Annotation techniques based solely on the identification of local matches tend to confound local sequence similarity and overall protein homology and thus don't mirror the complex multidomain architecture and the shuffling of functional domains in many protein families. Here, we present MetaGeneHunt to identify specific protein domains and to normalize the hit-counts based on the domain length. We used MetaGeneHunt to investigate the potential for carbohydrate processing in the mouse gastrointestinal tract. We sampled, sequenced, and analyzed the microbial communities associated with the bolus in the stomach, intestine, cecum, and colon of five captive mice. Focusing on Glycoside Hydrolases (GHs) we found that, across samples, 58.3% of the 4,726,023 short-read sequences matching with a GH domain-containing protein were located outside the domain of interest. Next, before comparing the samples, the counts of localized hits matching the domains of interest were normalized to account for the corresponding domain length. Microbial communities in the intestine and cecum displayed characteristic GH profiles matching distinct microbial assemblages. Conversely, the stomach and colon were associated with structurally and functionally more diverse and variable microbial communities. Across samples, despite fluctuations, changes in the functional potential for carbohydrate processing correlated with changes in community composition. Overall MetaGeneHunt is a new way to quickly and precisely identify discrete protein domains in sequenced metagenomes processed with MG-RAST. In addition, using the sister program "GeneHunt" to create custom Reference Annotation Table, MetaGeneHunt provides an unprecedented way to (re)investigate the precise distribution of any protein domain in short-reads metagenomes.

## SuRF: A new method for sparse variable selection, with application in microbiome data analysis.
 21.11.2020, _L Liu, H Gu, J Van Limbergen, T Kenney_


In this article, we present a new variable selection method for regression and classification purposes, particularly for microbiome analysis. Our method, called subsampling ranking forward selection (SuRF), is based on LASSO penalized regression, subsampling and forward-selection methods. SuRF offers major advantages over existing variable selection methods in terms of both sparsity of selected models and model inference. We provide an R package that can implement our method for generalized linear models. We apply our method to classification problems from microbiome data, using a novel agglomeration approach to deal with the special tree-like correlation structure of the variables. Existing methods arbitrarily choose a taxonomic level a priori before performing the analysis, whereas by combining SuRF with these aggregated variables, we are able to identify the key biomarkers at the appropriate taxonomic level, as suggested by the data. We present simulations in multiple sparse settings to demonstrate that our approach performs better than several other popularly used existing approaches in recovering the true variables. We apply SuRF to two microbiome datasets: one about prediction of pouchitis and another for identifying samples from two healthy individuals. We find that SuRF can provide a better or comparable prediction with other methods while controlling the false positive rate of variable selection.
