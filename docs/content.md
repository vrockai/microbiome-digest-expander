## Symbiosis and stress: how plant microbiomes affect host evolution.
 10.08.2020, _CV Hawkes, JJ Bull, JA Lau_


Existing paradigms for plant microevolution rarely acknowledge the potential impacts of diverse microbiomes on evolutionary processes. Many plant-associated microorganisms benefit the host via access to resources, protection from pathogens, or amelioration of abiotic stress. In doing so, they alter the plant's perception of the environment, potentially reducing the strength of selection acting on plant stress tolerance or defence traits or altering the traits that are the target of selection. We posit that the microbiome can affect plant microevolution via (1) manipulation of plant phenotypes in ways that increase plant fitness under stress and (2) direct microbial responses to the environment that benefit the plant. Both mechanisms might favour plant genotypes that attract or stimulate growth of the most responsive microbial populations or communities. We provide support for these scenarios using infectious disease and quantitative genetics models. Finally, we discuss how beneficial plant-microbiome associations can evolve if traditional mechanisms maintaining cooperation in pairwise symbioses, namely partner fidelity, partner choice and fitness alignment, also apply to the interactions between plants and diverse foliar and soil microbiomes. To understand the role of the plant microbiome in host evolution will require a broad ecological understanding of plant-microbe interactions across both space and time. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of the microbiome in host evolution'.

## Evidence for contamination as the origin for bacteria found in human placenta rather than a microbiota.
 10.08.2020, _R Gschwind, T Fournier, S Kennedy, V Tsatsaris, AG Cordier, F Barbut, MJ Butel, S Wydau-Dematteis_


Until recently the in utero environment of pregnant women was considered sterile. Recent high-sensitivity molecular techniques and high-throughput sequencing lead to some evidence for a low-biomass microbiome associated with the healthy placenta. Other studies failed to reveal evidence for a consistent presence of bacteria using either culture or molecular based techniques. Comparing conflicting "placental microbiome" studies is complicated by the use of varied and inconsistent protocols. Given this situation, we undertook an evaluation of the in utero environment sterility using several controlled methods, in the same study, to evaluate the presence or absence of bacteria and to explain contradictions present in the literature. Healthy pregnant women (n = 38) were recruited in three maternity wards. Placenta were collected after cesarean section with or without Alexis® and vaginal delivery births. For this study we sampled fetal membranes, umbilical cord and chorionic villi. Bacterial presence was analyzed using bacterial culture and qPCR on 34 fetal membranes, umbilical cord and chorionic villi samples. Shotgun metagenomics was performed on seven chorionic villi samples. We showed that the isolation of meaningful quantities of viable bacteria or bacterial DNA was possible only outside the placenta (fetal membranes and umbilical cords) highlighting the importance of sampling methods in studying the in utero environment. Bacterial communities described by metagenomics analysis were similar in chorionic villi samples and in negative controls and were dependent on the database chosen for the analysis. We conclude that the placenta does not harbor a specific, consistent and functional microbiota.

## Epidemiology and associated microbiota changes in deployed military personnel at high risk of traveler's diarrhea.
 13.08.2020, _WA Walters, F Reyes, GM Soto, ND Reynolds, JA Fraser, R Aviles, DR Tribble, AP Irvin, N Kelley-Loughnane, RL Gutierrez, MS Riddle, RE Ley, MS Goodson, MP Simons_


Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is the most prevalent illness encountered by deployed military personnel and has a major impact on military operations, from reduced job performance to lost duty days. Frequently, the etiology of TD is unknown and, with underreporting of cases, it is difficult to accurately assess its impact. An increasing number of ailments include an altered or aberrant gut microbiome. To better understand the relationships between long-term deployments and TD, we studied military personnel during two nine-month deployment cycles in 2015-2016 to Honduras. To collect data on the prevalence of diarrhea and impact on duty, a total of 1173 personnel completed questionnaires at the end of their deployment. 56.7% reported reduced performance and 21.1% reported lost duty days. We conducted a passive surveillance study of all cases of diarrhea reporting to the medical unit with 152 total cases and a similar pattern of etiology. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC, 52/152), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC, 50/152), and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC, 35/152) were the most prevalent pathogens detected. An active longitudinal surveillance of 67 subjects also identified diarrheagenic E. coli as the primary etiology (7/16 EPEC, 7/16 EAEC, and 6/16 ETEC). Eleven subjects were recruited into a nested longitudinal substudy to examine gut microbiome changes associated with deployment. A 16S rRNA amplicon survey of fecal samples showed differentially abundant baseline taxa for subjects who contracted TD versus those who did not, as well as detection of taxa positively associated with self-reported gastrointestinal distress. Disrupted microbiota was also qualitatively observable for weeks preceding and following the incidents of TD. These findings illustrate the complex etiology of diarrhea amongst military personnel in deployed settings and its impacts on job performance. Potential factors of resistance or susceptibility can provide a foundation for future clinical trials to evaluate prevention and treatment strategies.

## Differential alteration in gut microbiome profiles during acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP.
 13.08.2020, _J Zhang, C Deji, J Fan, L Chang, X Miao, Y Xiao, Y Zhu, S Li_


Substance addiction is a chronic and complicated disease involving genetic and environmental factors. Coregulated by the above factors, perturbations of the gut microbiome have been shown to have an essential role in the development of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction. However, shifts in the gut microbiome during different stages of morphine addiction remain uncharacterized. In the present study, we harvested fecal samples from mice at the acquisition (both the control and morphine groups), extinction and reinstatement stages of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Gut microbiome profiles were detected with 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. We observed an increase in community richness following morphine conditioning, and it decreased after 4 weeks of abstinence. The abundance of Verrucomicrobia increased and Bacteroides decreased at the acquisition of morphine-induced CPP, while a recovery trend was found at the extinction stage. Several discriminative genera were identified for the characterization of different stages of morphine CPP. Functional analysis of taxa with differential abundance between CPP stages was mainly enriched in the pathways of amino acid metabolism. Taken together, our findings will extend the association between dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and the opioid-induced rewarding or reinforcing behaviors.

## Modulation of the intestinal microbiota of broilers supplemented with monensin or functional oils in response to challenge by Eimeria spp.
 14.08.2020, _AM Vieira, TAT Soratto, KM Cardinal, G Wagner, L Hauptli, ALF Lima, F Dahlke, D Peres Netto, PO Moraes, AML Ribeiro_


The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation with 100ppm sodium monensin or 0.15% of a blend of functional oils (cashew nut oil + castor oil) on the intestinal microbiota of broilers challenged with three different Eimeria spp. The challenge was accomplished by inoculating broiler chicks with sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella, Eimeria acervulina, and Eimeria maxima via oral gavage. A total of 864, day-old male broiler chicks (Cobb) were randomly assigned to six treatments (eight pens/treatment; 18 broilers/pen) in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement, composed of three additives (control, monensin or blend), with or without Eimeria challenge. Intestinal contents was collected at 28 days of age for microbiota analysis by sequencing 16s rRNA in V3 and V4 regions using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Taxonomy was assigned through the SILVA database version 132, using the QIIME 2 software version 2019.1. No treatment effects (p &gt; 0.05) were observed in the microbial richness at the family level estimated by Chao1 and the biodiversity assessed by Simpson's index, except for Shannon's index (p &lt; 0.05). The intestinal microbiota was dominated by members of the order Clostridiales and Lactobacillales, followed by the families Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Lactobacillaceae, regardless of treatment. When the controls were compared, in the challenged control group there was an increase in Erysipelotrichaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae, and a decrease in Ruminococcaceae. Similar results were found for a challenged group that received monensin, while the blend partially mitigated this variation. Therefore, the blend alleviated the impact of coccidiosis challenge on the microbiome of broilers compared to monensin.

## Herpes simplex virus infection, Acyclovir and IVIG treatment all independently cause gut dysbiosis.
 14.08.2020, _C Ramakrishna, S Mendonca, PM Ruegger, JH Kim, J Borneman, EM Cantin_


Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV) is a ubiquitous human virus resident in a majority of the global population as a latent infection. Acyclovir (ACV), is the standard of care drug used to treat primary and recurrent infections, supplemented in some patients with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment to suppress infection and deleterious inflammatory responses. As many diverse medications have recently been shown to change composition of the gut microbiome, we used Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the effects of ACV and IVIG on the gut bacterial community. We found that HSV, ACV and IVIG can all independently disrupt the gut bacterial community in a sex biased manner when given to uninfected C57BL/6 mice. Treatment of HSV infected mice with ACV or IVIG alone or together revealed complex interactions between these drugs and infection that caused pronounced sex biased dysbiosis. ACV reduced Bacteroidetes levels in male but not female mice, while levels of the Anti-inflammatory Clostridia (AIC) were reduced in female but not male mice, which is significant as these taxa are associated with protection against the development of graft versus host disease (GVHD) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. Gut barrier dysfunction is associated with GVHD in HSCT patients and ACV also decreased Akkermansia muciniphila, which is important for maintaining gut barrier functionality. Cumulatively, our data suggest that long-term prophylactic ACV treatment of HSCT patients may contribute to GVHD and also potentially impact immune reconstitution. These data have important implications for other clinical settings, including HSV eye disease and genital infections, where ACV is given long-term.

## Raw milk and fecal microbiota of commercial Alpine dairy cows varies with herd, fat content and diet.
 14.08.2020, _F Albonico, C Barelli, D Albanese, M Manica, E Partel, F Rosso, S Ripellino, M Pindo, C Donati, A Zecconi, M Mortarino, HC Hauffe_


The factors that influence the diversity and composition of raw milk and fecal microbiota in healthy commercial dairy herds are not fully understood, partially because the majority of metataxonomic studies involve experimental farms and/or single factors. We analyzed the raw milk and fecal microbiota of 100 healthy cows from 10 commercial alpine farms from the Province of Trento, Italy, using metataxonomics and applied statistical modelling to investigate which extrinsic and intrinsic parameters (e.g. herd, diet and milk characteristics) correlated with microbiota richness and composition in these relatively small traditional farms. We confirmed that Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families dominated the fecal and milk samples of these dairy cows, but in addition, we found an association between the number of observed OTUs and Shannon entropy on each farm that indicates higher microbiota richness is associated with increased microbiota stability. Modelling showed that herd was the most significant factor affecting the variation in both milk and fecal microbiota composition. Furthermore, the most important predictors explaining the variation of microbiota richness were milk characteristics (i.e. percentage fat) and diet for milk and fecal samples, respectively. We discuss how high intra-herd variation could affect the development of treatments based on microbiota manipulation.

## Patient propagules: Do soil archives preserve the legacy of fungal and prokaryotic communities?
 11.08.2020, _GMN Benucci, B Rennick, G Bonito_


Soil archives are an important resource in agronomic and ecosystem sciences. If microbial communities could be reconstructed from archived soil DNA, as prehistoric plant communities are reconstructed via pollen data, soil archive resources would assume even greater value for reconstructing land-use history, forensic science, and biosphere modelling. Yet, the effects of long-term soil archival on the preservation of microbial DNA is still largely unknown. To address this, we assessed the capacity of high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of ITS (internal transcribed spacer) and prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes for reconstructing soil microbial communities across a 20 years time-series. We studied air-dried soil archives and fresh soil samples taken from Populus bioenergy and deciduous forest research plots at the Kellogg Biological Station. Habitat and archival time explained significant amounts of variation in soil microbial α- and β-diversity both in fungal and prokaryotic communities. We found that microbial richness, diversity, and abundance generally decreased with storage time, but varied between habitat and taxonomic groups. The high relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal species including Hebeloma and Cortinarius detected in older soil archives raises questions regarding traits such as long-term persistence and viability of ectomycorrhizal propagules in soils, with relevance to forest health and ecosystem succession. Talaromyces, Paecilomyces and Epicoccum spp. were detected in fresh and across 20-year-old archived soils and were also cultured from these soils demonstrating their long-term spore viability. In summary, we found that microbial DNA in air-dried soils archived over the past 20 years degraded with time, in a manner that differed between soil types and phylogenetic groups of microbes.

## Labile carbon limits late winter microbial activity near Arctic treeline.
 14.08.2020, _PF Sullivan, MC Stokes, CK McMillan, MN Weintraub_


Soil microbial communities remain active during much of the Arctic winter, despite deeply frozen soils. Overwinter microbial activity affects the global carbon (C) budget, nutrient cycling, and vegetation composition. Microbial respiration is highly temperature sensitive in frozen soils, as liquid water and solute availability decrease rapidly with declining temperature. Climate warming and changes in snowpack are leading to warmer Arctic winter soils. Warmer winter soils are thought to yield greater microbial respiration of available C, greater overwinter CO2 efflux and greater nutrient availability to plants at thaw. Using field and laboratory observations and experiments, we demonstrate that persistently warm winter soils can lead to labile C starvation and reduced microbial respiration, despite the high C content of most Arctic soils. If winter soils continue to warm, microbial C limitation will reduce expected CO2 emissions and alter soil nutrient cycling, if not countered by greater labile C inputs.

## Plant-archaea relationships: a potential means to improve crop production in arid and semi-arid regions.
 10.08.2020, _ET Alori, OC Emmanuel, BR Glick, OO Babalola_


Crop production in arid and semi-arid regions of the world is limited by several abiotic factors, including water stress, temperature extremes, low soil fertility, high soil pH, low soil water-holding capacity, and low soil organic matter. Moreover, arid and semi-arid areas experience low levels of rainfall with high spatial and temporal variability. Also, the indiscriminate use of chemicals, a practice that characterizes current agricultural practice, promotes crop and soil pollution potentially resulting in serious human health and environmental hazards. A reliable and sustainable alternative to current farming practice is, therefore, a necessity. One such option includes the use of plant growth-promoting microbes that can help to ameliorate some of the adverse effects of these multiple stresses. In this regard, archaea, functional components of the plant microbiome that are found both in the rhizosphere and the endosphere may contribute to the promotion of plant growth. Archaea can survive in extreme habitats such as areas with high temperatures and hypersaline water. No cases of archaea pathogenicity towards plants have been reported. Archaea appear to have the potential to promote plant growth, improve nutrient supply and protect plants against various abiotic stresses. A better understanding of recent developments in archaea functional diversity, plant colonizing ability, and modes of action could facilitate their eventual usage as reliable components of sustainable agricultural systems. The research discussed herein, therefore, addresses the potential role of archaea to improve sustainable crop production in arid and semi-arid areas.

## Effects of different habitats on the bacterial community composition in the water and sediments of Lake Taihu, China.
 10.08.2020, _W Chang, J Sun, Y Pang, S Zhang, L Gong, J Lu, B Feng, R Xu_


Bacterial communities are sensitive to environmental fluctuations, and a better understanding of the relationships between bacterial community distribution and complex environmental conditions is important for the remediation of lake ecosystems. In this study, bacterial communities from 7 water and 7 sediment samples in 3 different regions (east, the hydrophyte-dominated region; north, the transitional region; west, the highly polluted region) of Lake Taihu were investigated via high-throughput sequencing. The physicochemical characterization showed that there were obvious differences in the trophic statuses of the three lake regions, which were mainly due to the differences in pollutant concentration and hydrophyte coverage. The Shannon and Simpson values indicated that the diversity of bacterial communities in water was the highest in the eastern region, followed by the northern and western regions, while there was no significant difference in the bacterial community characteristics in sediments among lake regions. We found that the western lake region had the highest Cyanobacteria concentration (34.71%), suggesting that Cyanobacteria may have competitive advantages over the other bacterioplankton in water columns without plants. The abundances of Chlorobi detected in the water samples in the east (2.69%) and north (6.66%) were higher than those in the west because the high turbidity in the western lake region was unsuitable for the growth of Chlorobi. Nitrospirae (average 6.36%) and Chloroflexi (average 11.62%) were more common in the sediments than in the water of Lake Taihu, suggesting that the nutrient level of Lake Taihu sediment was higher than that of water bodies. Welch's t test revealed that there were significant differences in species abundance (such as Microcystis, Synechococcus, Flavobacterium, and hgcI_clade) among the different regions, except that the east was relatively similar to the north. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that TN, TP, and DO showed significant effects on the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial genera in water, while TOC, TP, and TN were positively correlated with TOC, TP and TN. This study provides useful information for understanding the variation in the diversity of bacterial communities in different habitats of Lake Taihu.

## Genomic and enzymatic evidence of acetogenesis by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea.
 10.08.2020, _S Yang, Y Lv, X Liu, Y Wang, Q Fan, Z Yang, N Boon, F Wang, X Xiao, Y Zhang_


Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mediated by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) is the primary process that provides energy to cold seep ecosystems by converting methane into inorganic carbon. Notably, cold seep ecosystems are dominated by highly divergent heterotrophic microorganisms. The role of the AOM process in supporting heterotrophic population remains unknown. We investigate the acetogenic capacity of ANME-2a in a simulated cold seep ecosystem using high-pressure biotechnology, where both AOM activity and acetate production are detected. The production of acetate from methane is confirmed by isotope-labeling experiments. A complete archaeal acetogenesis pathway is identified in the ANME-2a genome, and apparent acetogenic activity of the key enzymes ADP-forming acetate-CoA ligase and acetyl-CoA synthetase is demonstrated. Here, we propose a modified model of carbon cycling in cold seeps: during AOM process, methane can be converted into organic carbon, such as acetate, which further fuels the heterotrophic community in the ecosystem.

## Undinarchaeota illuminate DPANN phylogeny and the impact of gene transfer on archaeal evolution.
 10.08.2020, _N Dombrowski, TA Williams, J Sun, BJ Woodcroft, JH Lee, BQ Minh, C Rinke, A Spang_


The recently discovered DPANN archaea are a potentially deep-branching, monophyletic radiation of organisms with small cells and genomes. However, the monophyly and early emergence of the various DPANN clades and their role in life's evolution are debated. Here, we reconstructed and analysed genomes of an uncharacterized archaeal phylum (Candidatus Undinarchaeota), revealing that its members have small genomes and, while potentially being able to conserve energy through fermentation, likely depend on partner organisms for the acquisition of certain metabolites. Our phylogenomic analyses robustly place Undinarchaeota as an independent lineage between two highly supported 'DPANN' clans. Further, our analyses suggest that DPANN have exchanged core genes with their hosts, adding to the difficulty of placing DPANN in the tree of life. This pattern can be sufficiently dominant to allow identifying known symbiont-host clades based on routes of gene transfer. Together, our work provides insights into the origins and evolution of DPANN and their hosts.

## De novo sequence assembly requires bioinformatic checking of chimeric sequences.
 10.08.2020, _LS Arroyo Mühr, C Lagheden, SS Hassan, SN Kleppe, E Hultin, J Dillner_


De novo assembly of sequence reads from next generation sequencing platforms is a common strategy for detecting presence and sequencing of viruses in biospecimens. Amplification artifacts and presence of several related viruses in the same specimen can lead to assembly of erroneous, chimeric sequences. We now report that such chimeras can also occur between viral and non-viral biological sequences incorrectly joined together which may cause erroneous detection of viruses, highlighting the importance of performing a chimera checking step in bioinformatics pipelines. Using Illumina NextSeq and metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed 80 consecutive non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) from 11 immunosuppressed patients together with 11 NMSCs from patients who had only developed 1 NMSC. We aligned high-quality reads against a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) database and found HPV sequences in 9/91 specimens. A previous bioinformatic analysis of the same crude sequencing data from some of these samples had found an additional 3 specimens to be HPV-positive after performing de novo assembly. The reason for the discrepancy was investigated and found to be mostly caused by chimeric sequences containing both viral and non-viral sequences. Non-viral sequences were present in these 3 samples. To avoid erroneous detection of HPV when performing sequencing, we thus developed a novel script to identify HPV chimeric sequences.
