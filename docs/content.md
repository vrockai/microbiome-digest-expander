## Oral Microbiota Profile of Individuals Who Abuse Methamphetamine.
 27.09.2021, _Y Yang, X Yu, X Yang, K Zeng, G Liu, W Hao, S Zhang, G Wang_


The poor oral health condition of individuals who abuse methamphetamine (MA) is well known. The roles of the oral and fecal microbiomes in addiction and nervous system diseases have been the focus of many studies. However, changes in the microbiota composition of MA users have not been reported. This was addressed in the present study in 20 MA users and 14 sex-matched healthy subjects. Saliva samples were collected and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis were performed to evaluate oral microbiome profiles. The results showed that species richness was significantly lower in the MA group than in the control group. Bacterial taxa that are known to be related to oral diseases such as Negativicutes, Veillonellaceae, Veillonella, and Selenomonadales had higher relative abundance in the MA group than in the control group, and the relative abundance of Prevotella melaninogenica-a putative etiologic agent of periodontal disease-was also higher. Avoiding MA use and improving oral hygiene practices over a short term (i.e., during hospitalization for 2 weeks) did not alter the oral microbiota composition of MA users. Although the causal relationship between changes in oral microbiome profile and MA abuse remains to be determined, our results suggest that oral disease prevention and treatment strategies are important for MA users.

## The baseline oral microbiota predicts the response of locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma patients to induction chemotherapy: A prospective longitudinal study.
 27.09.2021, _M Rui, X Zhang, J Huang, D Wei, Z Li, Z Shao, H Ju, G Ren_


Among oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients who receive docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) induction chemotherapy, those with a favorable pathological response tend to obtain satisfactory clinical outcomes, while the total population exhibit no survival benefit. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve the therapeutic effect of TPF by applying personalized treatment according to distinct biomarkers.

## Gut microbiome in people living with HIV is associated with impaired thiamine and folate syntheses.
 26.09.2021, _SY Park, G Faraci, S Nanda, S Ter-Saakyan, TT Love, WJ Mack, MP Dub√©, HY Lee_


People living with HIV have a high incidence of cardiovascular and neurological diseases as comorbid disorders that are commonly linked to inflammation. While microbial translocation can augment inflammation during HIV infection, functional microbiome shifts that may increase pro-inflammatory responses have not been fully characterized. In addition, defining HIV-induced microbiome changes has been complicated by high variability among individuals. Here we conducted functional annotation of previously-published 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequences of 305 HIV positive and 249 negative individuals, with adjustment for geographic region, sex, sexual behavior, and age. Metagenome profiles were inferred from these individuals'16 S data. HIV infection was associated with impaired microbial vitamin B synthesis; around half of the gene families in thiamine and folate biosynthesis pathways were significantly less abundant in the HIV positive group than the negative control. These results are consistent with the high prevalence of thiamine and folate deficiencies in HIV infections. These HIV-induced microbiota shifts have the potential to influence cardiovascular and neurocognitive diseases, given the documented associations between B-vitamin deficiencies, inflammation, and these diseases. We also observed that most essential amino acid biosynthesis pathways were downregulated in the microbiome of HIV-infected individuals. Microbial vitamin B and amino acid synthesis pathways were not significantly recovered by antiretroviral treatment when we compared 262 ART positive and 184 ART negative individuals. Our meta-analysis provides a new outlook for understanding vitamin B and amino acid deficiencies in HIV patients, suggesting that interventions for reversing HIV-induced microbiome shifts may aid in lessening the burdens of HIV comorbidities.

## The impact of pelvic radiotherapy on the gut microbiome and its role in radiation-induced diarrhoea: a systematic review.
 26.09.2021, _L Wang, X Wang, G Zhang, Y Ma, Q Zhang, Z Li, J Ran, X Hou, Y Geng, Z Yang, S Feng, C Li, X Zhao_


Pelvic radiotherapy is the key treatment for pelvic malignancies, usually including pelvic primary tumour lesions and lymphatic drainage areas in the pelvic region. Therefore, the intestinal tract in the radiation field is inevitably damaged, a phenomenon clinically referred to as radiation enteritis, and diarrhoea is the most common clinical symptom of radiation enteritis. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mechanism of radiation-induced diarrhoea. It has been found that the gut microbiome plays an important role in the development of diarrhoea in response to pelvic radiotherapy, and the species and distribution of intestinal microbiota are significantly altered in patients after pelvic radiotherapy. In this study, we searched for articles indexed in the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE and PubMed databases in English and CNKI, Wanfang data and SINOMED in Chinese from their inception dates through 13 March 2020 to collect studies on the gut microbiome in pelvic radiotherapy patients. Eventually, we included eight studies: one study report on prostatic carcinoma, five studies on gynaecological carcinoma and two papers on pelvic carcinomas. All studies were designed as self-controlled studies, except for one that compared toxicity to nontoxicity. The results from all the studies showed that the diversity of intestinal flora decreased during and after pelvic radiotherapy, and the diversity of intestinal flora decreased significantly in patients with diarrhoea after radiotherapy. Five studies observed that the community composition of the gut microbiota changed at the phylum, order or genus level before, during, and after pelvic radiotherapy at different time points. In addition, the composition of the gut microbiota before radiotherapy was different between patients with postradiotherapy diarrhoea and those without diarrhoea in five studies. However, relevant studies have not reached consistent results regarding the changes in microbiota composition. Changes in the intestinal flora induced by pelvic radiotherapy and their relationship between changes in intestinal flora and the occurrence of radiation-induced diarrhoea (RID) are discussed in this study, providing a theoretical basis for the causes of RID after pelvic radiotherapy.

## Gut Microbiota-Mediated Modulation of Cancer Progression and Therapy Efficacy.
 27.09.2021, _P Cheng, P Shen, Y Shan, Y Yang, R Deng, W Chen, Y Lu, Z Wei_


The role of gut microbiota in the development of various tumors has been a rising topic of public interest, and in recent years, many studies have reported a close relationship between microbial groups and tumor development. Gut microbiota play a role in host metabolism, and the positive and negative alterations of these microbiota have an effect on tumor treatment. The microbiota directly promote, eliminate, and coordinate the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs and the toxicity of adjuvant drugs, and enhance the ability of patients to respond to tumors in adjuvant immunotherapy. In this review, we outline the significance of gut microbiota in tumor development, reveal its impacts on chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and discover various potential mechanisms whereby they influence tumor treatment. This review demonstrates the importance of intestinal microbiota-related research for clinical tumor treatment and provides additional strategy for clinical assistance in cancer treatment.

## Xylanase impact beyond performance: A microbiome approach in laying hens.
 23.09.2021, _V Van Hoeck, I Somers, A Abdelqader, AL Wealleans, S Van de Craen, D Morisset_


Anti-nutritional compounds such as non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) are present in viscous cereals used in feed for poultry. Therefore, exogenous carbohydrases are commonly added to monogastric feed to degrade these NSP. Our hypothesis is that xylanase not only improves laying hen performance and digestibility, but also induces a significant shift in microbial composition within the intestinal tract and thereby might exert a prebiotic effect. In this context, a better understanding on whether and how the chicken gut microbial population can be modulated by xylanase is required. To do so, the effects of dietary supplementation of xylanase on performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and cecal microbiome in laying hens were evaluated in the present study. A total of 96 HiSex laying hens were used in this experiment (3 diets and 16 replicates of 2 hens). Xylanase was added to the diets at concentrations of 0, 45,000 (15 g/t XygestTM HT) and 90,000 U/kg (30 g/t Xygest HT). The diets were based on wheat (~55%), soybean and sunflower meal. The lowest dosage, 45,000 U/kg, significantly increased average egg weight and improved feed efficiency compared to the control treatment (P&lt;0.05). Egg quality parameters were significantly improved in the experiment in response to the xylanase addition. For example, during the last 28 days of the trial, birds receiving the 45,000 U/kg and the 90,000 U/kg treatments exhibited an increase in Haugh units and albumin heights (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the control, the ATTD of organic matter and crude protein were drastically improved in the 45,000 U/kg treatment group (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, gross energy and the ATTD of crude fat were improved significantly for birds fed 90,000 U/kg group compared to the control. Importantly, 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that xylanase at 45,000 U/kg dosage can exert a change in the cecal microbiome. A significant increase in beneficial bacteria (Bacilli class; Enterococcaceae and Lactobacillales orders; Merdibacter, Enterococcus and Nocardiopsis genera; Enterococcus casseliflavus species) was documented when adding 45,000 U/kg xylanase to the diet of laying hens. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of xylanase 45,000 U/kg significantly improved laying hen performance and digestibility. Furthermore, microbiome data suggest that xylanase modulates the laying hen bacterial population beneficially, thus potentially exerting a prebiotic effect.

## Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome impairs mouse skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise.
 27.09.2021, _TR Valentino, IJ Vechetti, CB Mobley, CM Dungan, L Golden, J Goh, JJ McCarthy_


Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome caused by continuous antibiotic treatment did not affect running activity. Continuous treatment with antibiotics did not result in systemic inflammation as indicated by serum cytokine levels. Gut microbiome dysbiosis was associated with blunted fiber-type specific hypertrophy in the soleus and plantaris muscles in response to progressive weighted wheel running (PoWeR). Gut microbiome dysbiosis was associated with impaired PoWeR-induced fiber-type shift in the plantaris muscle. Gut microbiome dysbiosis was associated with a loss of PoWeR-induced myonuclei accretion in the plantaris muscle.

## Alteration of Gut Microbiota of a Food-Storing Hibernator, Siberian Chipmunk Tamias sibiricus.
 25.09.2021, _J Zhou, M Wang, X Yi_


Hibernation represents a state of fasting because hibernators cease eating in the torpid periods. Therefore, food deprivation during hibernation is expected to modify the gut microbiota of host. However, there are few reports of gut microbiota in food-storing hibernators that feed during the interbout arousals. Here we collected fecal samples of Siberian chipmunk T. sibiricus to character and examine changes in the gut microbiota at various stages relative to hibernation: pre-hibernation, early-hibernation, mid-hibernation, late-hibernation, and post-hibernation. Compared to the pre-hibernation state, alpha-diversity of gut microbiota was significantly increased during the interbout arousal periods. In addition, beta-diversity of the fecal communities from pre-hibernation and interbout arousal periods grouped together, and post-hibernation gut microbiota resembled the counterpart at late-hibernation. Hibernation significantly decreased the relative abundance of Firmicutes but increased Bacteroidetes, reflecting a shift of microbiota toward taxa in favor of host-derived substrates. The increased abundance of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, Lactobacillus, and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group in gut microbiota may help the chipmunks reduce intestinal inflammation and then maintain healthy bowel during hibernation. KEGG pathway indicated that hibernation altered the metabolic function of gut microflora of T. sibiricus. Our study provides evidence that the gut microbiota of food-storing hibernators, despite feeding during the interbout arousals, shows similar response to hibernation that has well documented in fat-storing counterparts, suggesting the potential for a core gut microbiota during hibernation of mammals. Importantly, these results will broaden our understanding of the effects of hibernation on gut microbiota of mammal hibernators.
