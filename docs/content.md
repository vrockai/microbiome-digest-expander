Patients exposed to trauma often experience high rates of adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). The biological mechanisms promoting APNS are currently unknown, but the microbiota-gut-brain axis offers an avenue to understanding mechanisms as well as possibilities for intervention. Microbiome composition after trauma exposure has been poorly examined regarding neuropsychiatric outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the gut microbiomes of trauma-exposed emergency department patients who develop APNS have dysfunctional gut microbiome profiles and discover potential associated mechanisms. We performed metagenomic analysis on stool samples (n = 51) from a subset of adults enrolled in the Advancing Understanding of RecOvery afteR traumA (AURORA) study. Two-, eight- and twelve-week post-trauma outcomes for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PTSD checklist for DSM-5), normalized depression scores (PROMIS Depression Short Form 8b) and somatic symptom counts were collected. Generalized linear models were created for each outcome using microbial abundances and relevant demographics. Mixed-effect random forest machine learning models were used to identify associations between APNS outcomes and microbial features and encoded metabolic pathways from stool metagenomics. Microbial species, including Flavonifractor plautii, Ruminococcus gnavus and, Bifidobacterium species, which are prevalent commensal gut microbes, were found to be important in predicting worse APNS outcomes from microbial abundance data. Notably, through APNS outcome modeling using microbial metabolic pathways, worse APNS outcomes were highly predicted by decreased L-arginine related pathway genes and increased citrulline and ornithine pathways. Common commensal microbial species are enriched in individuals who develop APNS. More notably, we identified a biological mechanism through which the gut microbiome reduces global arginine bioavailability, a metabolic change that has also been demonstrated in the plasma of patients with PTSD.

Despite a growing recognition that the type of nutrition received by preterm infants influences their intestinal microbiome and health outcomes, the microbiota of mother's own milk (MOM), pasteurized donor human milk (PDHM), and infant formula remain poorly characterized. In our study, we found that the structure of microbial communities, bacterial diversity, and relative abundances of specific genera were significantly different between MOM, PDHM, and formula. Additionally, our results suggest that the microbiota of MOM changes as a function of time and maternal factors. Lastly, we identified three lactotypes within MOM that have distinct microbial compositions and described the maternal factors associated with them. These findings set the stage for future research aimed at advancing our knowledge of the microbiota of preterm infant nutrition and the specific influence it may have on health outcomes.

## Systematic mining of the human microbiome identifies antimicrobial peptides with diverse activity spectra.
 17.11.2023, _AM King, Z Zhang, E Glassey, P Siuti, J Clardy, CA Voigt_


Human-associated bacteria secrete modified peptides to control host physiology and remodel the microbiota species composition. Here we scanned 2,229 Human Microbiome Project genomes of species colonizing skin, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, mouth and trachea for gene clusters encoding RiPPs (ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides). We found 218 lanthipeptides and 25 lasso peptides, 70 of which were synthesized and expressed in E. coli and 23 could be purified and functionally characterized. They were tested for activity against bacteria associated with healthy human flora and pathogens. New antibiotics were identified against strains implicated in skin, nasal and vaginal dysbiosis as well as from oral strains selectively targeting those in the gut. Extended- and narrow-spectrum antibiotics were found against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. Mining natural products produced by human-associated microbes will enable the elucidation of ecological relationships and may be a rich resource for antimicrobial discovery.

## The Potential of Meta-Proteomics and Artificial Intelligence to Establish the Next Generation of Probiotics for Personalized Healthcare.
 13.11.2023, _A Das, RN Behera, A Kapoor, K Ambatipudi_


The symbiosis of probiotic bacteria with humans has rendered various health benefits while providing nutrition and a suitable environment for their survival. However, the probiotics must survive unfavorable gut conditions to exert beneficial effects. The intrinsic resistance of probiotics to survive harsh conditions results from a myriad of proteins. Interaction of microbial proteins with the host is indispensable for modulating the gut microbiome, such as interaction with cell receptors and protective action against pathogens. The complex interplay of proteins should be unraveled by utilizing metaproteomic strategies. The contribution of probiotics to health is now widely accepted. However, due to the inconsistency of generalized probiotics, contemporary research toward precision probiotics has gained momentum for customized treatment. This review explores the application of metaproteomics and AI/ML algorithms in resolving multiomics data analysis and in silico prediction of microbial features for screening specific beneficial probiotic organisms. Implementing these integrative strategies could augment the potential of precision probiotics for personalized healthcare.

As the proportion of older people in the world's population steadily increases, there is an urgent need to identify ways to support healthy aging. The gut microbiome has been proposed to be involved in aging-related diseases and has become an attractive target for improving health in older people. Herein, we cover the relationship between the gut microbiome and chronological age in adults, and then, we discuss the gut microbiome features associated with frailty, as a hallmark of unhealthy aging in older people. Furthermore, we describe the effects of microbiome-targeted interventions, such as dietary patterns and consumption of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, on modulating the gut microbiome composition and further promoting healthy aging. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of gut microbiome-induced aging complications and to develop personalized microbiome-based strategies for reducing the severity of frailty or preventing the onset of frailty in older adults.

## Host species and habitat shape fish-associated bacterial communities: phylosymbiosis between fish and their microbiome.
 20.11.2023, _J Sadeghi, SR Chaganti, TB Johnson, DD Heath_


While many studies have reported that the structure of the gut and skin microbiota is driven by both species-specific and habitat-specific factors, the relative importance of host-specific versus environmental factors in wild vertebrates remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the diversity and composition of fish skin, gut, and surrounding water bacterial communities (hereafter referred to as microbiota) and assess the extent to which host habitat and phylogeny predict microbiota similarity. Skin swabs and gut samples from 334 fish belonging to 17 species were sampled in three Laurentian Great Lakes (LGLs) habitats (Detroit River, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario). We also collected and filtered water samples at the time of fish collection. We analyzed bacterial community composition using 16S metabarcoding and tested for community variation.

## PSKR1 balances the plant growth-defence trade-off in the rhizosphere microbiome.
 17.11.2023, _S Song, Z Morales Moreira, AL Briggs, XC Zhang, AC Diener, CH Haney_


Microbiota benefit their hosts by improving nutrient uptake and pathogen protection. How host immunity restricts microbiota while avoiding autoimmunity is poorly understood. Here we show that the Arabidopsis phytosulfokine receptor 1 (pskr1) mutant displays autoimmunity (plant stunting, defence-gene expression and reduced rhizosphere bacterial growth) in response to growth-promoting Pseudomonas fluorescens. Microbiome profiling and microbiota colonization showed that PSKR1-mediated reduction in bacterial growth and stunting is largely specific to Pseudomonas. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that PSKR1 regulates the growth-defence trade-off during Pseudomonas colonization: PSKR1 upregulates plant photosynthesis and root growth but suppresses salicylic-acid-mediated defences. Genetic epistasis experiments showed that pskr1 stunting and restriction of bacterial growth are salicylic acid dependent. Finally, we showed that Pseudomonas, but not other bacteria, induces PSKR1 expression in roots, suggesting that Pseudomonas might manipulate plant signalling to promote its colonization. Our data demonstrate a genetic mechanism to coordinate beneficial functions of the microbiome while preventing autoimmunity.

## The pan-microbiome profiling system Taxa4Meta identifies clinical dysbiotic features and classifies diarrheal disease.
 14.11.2023, _Q Wu, S Badu, SY So, TJ Treangen, TC Savidge_


Targeted metagenomic sequencing is an emerging strategy to survey disease- specific microbiome biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. However, this approach often yields inconsistent or conflicting results due to inadequate study power and sequencing bias. We introduce Taxa4Meta, a bioinformatics pipeline explicitly designed to compensate for technical and demographic bias. We designed and validated Taxa4Meta for accurate taxonomic profiling of 16S rRNA amplicon data acquired from different sequencing strategies. Taxa4Meta offers significant potential in identifying clinical dysbiotic features that can reliably predict human disease, validated comprehensively via re-analysis of individual patient 16S datasets. We leveraged the power of Taxa4Meta's pan-microbiome profiling to generate 16S-based classifiers that exhibited excellent utility for stratification of diarrheal patients with Clostridioides difficile infection, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel diseases, which represent common misdiagnoses and pose significant challenges for clinical management. We believe that Taxa4Meta represents a new "best practices" approach to individual microbiome surveys that can be used to define gut dysbiosis at a population-scale level.

## Machine learning for microbiologists.
 15.11.2023, _F Asnicar, AM Thomas, A Passerini, L Waldron, N Segata_


Machine learning is increasingly important in microbiology where it is used for tasks such as predicting antibiotic resistance and associating human microbiome features with complex host diseases. The applications in microbiology are quickly expanding and the machine learning tools frequently used in basic and clinical research range from classification and regression to clustering and dimensionality reduction. In this Review, we examine the main machine learning concepts, tasks and applications that are relevant for experimental and clinical microbiologists. We provide the minimal toolbox for a microbiologist to be able to understand, interpret and use machine learning in their experimental and translational activities.
