Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy in childbearing-age females which can cause many complications, such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. The metabolic disorders in patients with PCOS were linked to gut microbial dysbiosis. However, the correlation between the gut microbial community and dyslipidemia in PCOS remains unillustrated. Our study elucidated the different gut microbiota in patients with PCOS and dyslipidemia (PCOS.D) compared to those with only PCOS and healthy women.

## Framework for exploring the sensory repertoire of the human gut microbiota.
 17.05.2024, _PA Ross, W Xu, E Jalomo-Khayrova, G Bange, VM Gumerov, PH Bradley, V Sourjik, IB Zhulin_


Bacteria sense changes in their environment and transduce signals to adjust their cellular functions accordingly. For this purpose, bacteria employ various sensors feeding into multiple signal transduction pathways. Signal recognition by bacterial sensors is studied mainly in a few model organisms, but advances in genome sequencing and analysis offer new ways of exploring the sensory repertoire of many understudied organisms. The human gut is a natural target of this line of study: it is a nutrient-rich and dynamic environment and is home to thousands of bacterial species whose activities impact human health. Many gut commensals are also poorly studied compared to model organisms and are mainly known through their genome sequences. To begin exploring the signals human gut commensals sense and respond to, we have designed a framework that enables the identification of sensory domains, prediction of signals that they recognize, and experimental verification of these predictions. We validate this framework's functionality by systematically identifying amino acid sensors in selected bacterial genomes and metagenomes, characterizing their amino acid binding properties, and demonstrating their signal transduction potential.IMPORTANCESignal transduction is a central process governing how bacteria sense and respond to their environment. The human gut is a complex environment with many living organisms and fluctuating streams of nutrients. One gut inhabitant, Escherichia coli, is a model organism for studying signal transduction. However, E. coli is not representative of most gut microbes, and signaling pathways in the thousands of other organisms comprising the human gut microbiota remain poorly understood. This work provides a foundation for how to explore signals recognized by these organisms.

Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) play a pivotal role in gut physiology by governing intestinal epithelium renewal through the precise regulation of proliferation and differentiation. The gut microbiota interacts closely with the epithelium through myriad of actions, including immune and metabolic interactions, which translate into tight connections between microbial activity and ISC function. Given the diverse functions of the gut microbiota in affecting the metabolism of macronutrients and micronutrients, dietary nutrients exert pronounced effects on host-microbiota interactions and, consequently, the ISC fate. Therefore, understanding the intricate host-microbiota interaction in regulating ISC homeostasis is imperative for improving gut health. Here, we review recent advances in understanding host-microbiota immune and metabolic interactions that shape ISC function, such as the role of pattern-recognition receptors and microbial metabolites, including lactate and indole metabolites. Additionally, the diverse regulatory effects of the microbiota on dietary nutrients, including proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals (e.g. iron and zinc), are thoroughly explored in relation to their impact on ISCs. Thus, we highlight the multifaceted mechanisms governing host-microbiota interactions in ISC homeostasis. Insights gained from this review provide strategies for the development of dietary or microbiota-based interventions to foster gut health.

_Humans, Proteomics, Dysbiosis, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Nervous System Diseases, Animals, Brain-Gut Axis, Biomarkers_
The human gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic community of microorganisms, that influence metabolic, neurodevelopmental, and immune pathways. Microbial dysbiosis, characterized by changes in microbial diversity and relative abundances, is implicated in the development of various chronic neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. These disorders are marked by the accumulation of pathological protein aggregates, leading to the progressive loss of neurons and behavioural functions. Dysregulations in protein-protein interaction networks and signalling complexes, critical for normal brain function, are common in neurological disorders but challenging to unravel, particularly at the neuron and synapse-specific levels. To advance therapeutic strategies, a deeper understanding of neuropathogenesis, especially during the progressive disease phase, is needed. Biomarkers play a crucial role in identifying disease pathophysiology and monitoring disease progression. Proteomics, a powerful technology, shows promise in accelerating biomarker discovery and aiding in the development of novel treatments. In this chapter, we provide an in-depth overview of how proteomic techniques, utilizing various biofluid samples from patients with neurological conditions and diverse animal models, have contributed valuable insights into the pathogenesis of numerous neurological disorders. We also discuss the current state of research, potential challenges, and future directions in proteomic approaches to unravel neuro-pathological conditions.

Bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by abnormal and irreversible bronchial dilation resulting from lung tissue damage and can be categorized into two main groups: cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB). Both diseases are marked by recurrent infections, inflammatory exacerbations, and lung damage. Given that infections are the primary drivers of disease progression, characterization of the respiratory microbiome can shed light on compositional alterations and susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs in these cases compared to healthy individuals.

## Indole-3-Acetic Acid Protects Against Lipopolysaccharide-induced Endothelial Cell Dysfunction and Lung Injury through the Activation of USP40.
 18.05.2024, _N Shaheen, J Miao, D Li, B Xia, B Baoyinna, Y Zhao, J Zhao_


Lung microvascular endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is the pathological hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a key regulator in control of endothelial barrier disruption and inflammation. Our recent study has demonstrated that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 40 (USP40) preserves endothelial integrity by targeting HSP90 for its deubiquitination and inactivation. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a plant hormone of the auxin class, can also be catabolized from dietary tryptophan by the intestinal microbiota. Accumulating evidence suggests that IAA reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, and promotes intestinal barrier function. However, little is known about the role of IAA in endothelial cells and acute lung injury. In this study, we investigated the role of IAA in lung endothelial cell function in the context of acute lung injury. IAA exhibited EC barrier protection against LPS-induced reduction in transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and inflammatory responses. The underlying mechanism of IAA on EC protective effects were investigated by examining the influence of IAA on levels of HSP90 ubiquitination and USP40 activity. We identified that IAA, acting as a potential activator of USP40, reduces HSP90 ubiquitination, thereby protecting against LPS-induced inflammation in human lung microvascular endothelial cell (HLMVECs) as well as alleviating experimental lung injury. Furthermore, the EC protective effects of IAA against LPS-induced EC dysfunction and lung injury were abolished in USP40 deficient HLMVECs and lungs of USP40 EC specific knockout (USP40cdh5-ECKO) mice. Taken together, this study reveals that IAA protects against LPS-induced EC dysfunction and lung injury through the activation of USP40.

Translational microbiome research using next-generation DNA sequencing is challenging due to the semi-qualitative nature of relative abundance data. A novel method for quantitative analysis was applied in this 12-week clinical trial to understand the mechanical vs. chemotherapeutic actions of brushing, flossing, and mouthrinsing against the supragingival dental plaque microbiome. Enumeration of viable bacteria using vPCR was also applied on supragingival plaque for validation and on subgingival plaque to evaluate interventional effects below the gingival margin.

## Exploring the skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis pathogenesis and disease modification.
 18.05.2024, _C Hülpüsch, R Rohayem, M Reiger, C Traidl-Hoffmann_


Inflammatory skin diseases, like atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis, AD), affect children and adults globally. In AD, the skin barrier is impaired on multiple levels. Underlying factors include genetic, chemical, immunological, and microbial components. Increased skin pH in AD is part of the altered microbial microenvironment that promotes overgrowth of the skin microbiome with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The secretion of virulence factors, like toxins and proteases, by S. aureus further aggravates the skin barrier deficiency and additionally off-balances the already skewed immune response. Skin commensal bacteria, however, can inhibit the growth and pathogenicity of S. aureus through quorum sensing systems. Therefore, restoring a healthy skin microbiome could contribute to remission induction in AD. This review discusses direct and indirect approaches to targeting the skin microbiome through modulation of the skin pH, UV treatment, and pre-, pro-, and postbiotics. Furthermore, exploratory techniques like skin microbiome transplantation, ozone therapy, and phage therapy are discussed. Finally, we summarize the latest findings on disease and microbiome modification through targeted immunomodulatory, systemic treatments and biologicals. We believe that targeting the skin microbiome should be considered a crucial component of successful AD treatment in the future.

The low response rate of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is a challenge. The efficacy of ICIs is influenced by the tumour microenvironment, which is controlled by the gut microbiota. In particular, intestinal bacteria and their metabolites, such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are important regulators of cancer immunity; however, our knowledge on the effects of individual SCFAs remains limited. Here, we show that isobutyric acid has the strongest effect among SCFAs on both immune activity and tumour growth. In vitro, cancer cell numbers were suppressed by approximately 75% in humans and mice compared with those in controls. Oral administration of isobutyric acid to carcinoma-bearing mice enhanced the effect of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, reducing tumour volume by approximately 80% and 60% compared with those in the control group and anti-PD-1 antibody alone group, respectively. Taken together, these findings may support the development of novel cancer therapies that can improve the response rate to ICIs.

Dark pigmented snow and glacier ice algae on glaciers and ice sheets contribute to accelerating melt. The biological controls on these algae, particularly the role of viruses, remain poorly understood. Giant viruses, classified under the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) supergroup (phylum Nucleocytoviricota), are diverse and globally distributed. NCLDVs are known to infect eukaryotic cells in marine and freshwater environments, providing a biological control on the algal population in these ecosystems. However, there is very limited information on the diversity and ecosystem function of NCLDVs in terrestrial icy habitats.

## Ibuprofen degradation by mixed bacterial consortia: Metabolic pathway and microbial community analysis.
 22.05.2024, _A Rastogi, S Chaudhary, MK Tiwari, MM Ghangrekar_


Degradation of ibuprofen, one of the most consumed drugs globally, by a mixed bacterial consortium was investigated. A contaminated hospital soil was used to enrich a bacterial consortium possessing the ability to degrade 4 mg/L ibuprofen in 6 days, fed on 6 mM acetate as a supplementary carbon source. Maximum ibuprofen degradation achieved was 99.51%, and for optimum ibuprofen degradation modelled statistically, the initial ibuprofen concentration, and temperature were determined to be 0.515 mg/L and 35 °C, respectively. The bacterial community analyses demonstrated an enrichment of Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Bacillus, and Enterococcus in the presence of ibuprofen, suggesting their probable association with the biodegradation process. The biodegradation pathway developed using open-source metabolite predictors, GLORYx and BioTransformer suggested multiple degradation routes. Hydroxylation and oxidation were found to be the major mechanisms in ibuprofen degradation. Mono-hydroxylated metabolites were identified as well as predicted by the bioinformatics-based packages. Oxidation, dehydrogenation, super-hydroxylation, and hydrolysis were some other identified mechanisms.

## Examining the impacts of salt specificity on freshwater microbial community and functional potential following salinization.

The degradation of freshwater systems by salt pollution is a threat to global freshwater resources. Salinization is commonly identified by increased specific conductance (conductivity), a proxy for salt concentrations. However, conductivity fails to account for the diversity of salts entering freshwaters and the potential implications this has on microbial communities and functions. We tested 4 types of salt pollution-MgCl2, MgSO4, NaCl, and Na2SO4-on bacterial taxonomic and functional α-, β-diversity of communities originating from streams in two distinct localities (Nebraska [NE] and Ohio [OH], USA). Community responses depended on the site of origin, with NE and OH exhibiting more pronounced decreases in community diversity in response to Na2SO4 and MgCl2 than other salt amendments. A closer examination of taxonomic and functional diversity metrics suggests that core features of communities are more resistant to induced salt stress and that marginal features at both a population and functional level are more likely to exhibit significant structural shifts based on salt specificity. The lack of uniformity in community response highlights the need to consider the compositional complexities of salinization to accurately identify the ecological consequences of instances of salt pollution.

## The Representational Challenge for Designing and Managing 5P Medicine Ecosystems.
 24.05.2024, _B Blobel, F Oemig, P Ruotsalainen, M Brochhausen, M Giacomini_


_Precision Medicine, Humans, Artificial Intelligence_
Health and social care systems around the globe currently undergo a transformation towards personalized, preventive, predictive, participative precision medicine (5PM), considering the individual health status, conditions, genetic and genomic dispositions, etc., in personal, social, occupational, environmental and behavioral context. This transformation is strongly supported by technologies such as micro- and nanotechnologies, advanced computing, artificial intelligence, edge computing, etc. For enabling communication and cooperation between actors from different domains using different methodologies, languages and ontologies based on different education, experiences, etc., we have to understand the transformed health ecosystems and all its components in structure, function and relationships in the necessary detail ranging from elementary particles up to the universe. That way, we advance design and management of the complex and highly dynamic ecosystem from data to knowledge level. The challenge is the consistent, correct and formalized representation of the transformed health ecosystem from the perspectives of all domains involved, representing and managing them based on related ontologies. The resulting business view of the real-world ecosystem must be interrelated using the ISO/IEC 21838 Top Level Ontologies standard. Thereafter, the outcome can be transformed into implementable solutions using the ISO/IEC 10746 Open Distributed Processing Reference Model. Model and framework for this system-oriented, architecture-centric, ontology-based, policy-driven approach have been developed by the first author and meanwhile standardized as ISO 23903 Interoperability and Integration Reference Architecture.
