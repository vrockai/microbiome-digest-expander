## Dysbiosis of gut microbiota during fecal stream diversion in patients with colorectal cancer.
 23.08.2023, _SY Lee, HM Park, CH Kim, HR Kim_


The effect of fecal stream diversion on the gut microbiota is still uncertain. The present study was designed to assess the effect of fecal stream diversion on the composition of the gut microbiota in patients with colorectal cancer. We included patients undergoing left-sided colorectal cancer surgery with (ileostomy group) or without (control group) diverting ileostomy. Fecal samples were collected from 10 patients in each group before surgery (t1) and after ileostomy repair in the ileostomy group and 6-12 months after the initial surgery in the control group (t2). The fecal microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing, and changes in the composition of the fecal microbiota were compared between the two groups.

## The gut microbiome contributes to somatic morphine withdrawal behavior and implicates a TLR2 mediated mechanism.

The ongoing opioid epidemic has left millions of people suffering from opioid use disorder due to the over-prescription of highly addictive substances. Chronic opioid exposure leads to dependence, where the absence of the drug results in negative symptoms of withdrawal, often driving patients to continue drug use; however, few therapeutic strategies are currently available to combat the cycle of addiction and the severity of morphine withdrawal. This study investigates the microbiome as a potential therapeutic target for morphine withdrawal, as gut dysbiosis caused by morphine use has been proven to contribute to other aspects of opioid use disorders, such as tolerance. Results show that although the microbiome during morphine withdrawal trends toward recovery from morphine-induced dysbiosis, there continues to be a disruption in the alpha and beta diversity as well as the abundance of gram-positive bacteria that may still contribute to the severity of morphine withdrawal symptoms. Germ-free mice lacking the microbiome did not develop somatic withdrawal symptoms, indicating that the microbiome is necessary for the development of somatic withdrawal behavior. Notably, only TLR2 but not TLR4 whole-body knockout models display less withdrawal severity, implicating that the microbiome, through a gram-positive, TLR2 mediated mechanism, drives opioid-induced somatic withdrawal behavior.

Gut microbiota metabolites have been mechanistically linked to inflammatory pathway activation and atherosclerosis, which are major causes of vascular stiffness (VS). Aiming to investigate if the gut microbiome might be involved in VS development, we performed a cross-sectional study (n = 3,087), nested within the population-based European Prospective Investigations into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Potsdam. We investigated the correlation of the gut microbiota (alpha diversity and taxa abundance) with 3 vascular stiffness measures: carotid-femoral (PWV), aortic augmentation index (AIX) and ankle-brachial index (ABI). Shannon index was not significantly associated with VS but the number of observed Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) was positively associated with PWV and AIX. We found a total of 19 ASVs significantly associated with at least one VS measure in multivariable-adjusted models. One ASV (classified as Sutterella wadsworthensis) was associated with 2 VS measures, AIX (- 0.11 ± 0.04) and PWV (-0.14 ± 0.03). Other examples of ASVs associated with VS were Collinsella aerofaciens, previously reported to be affected by diet and Bacteroides uniformis, commercially available as probiotics. In conclusion, our study suggests a potential role of individual components of the gut microbiota in the aetiology of VS.

## Gut microbiota and intervertebral disc degeneration: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study.

Although previous studies have suggested a close association between gut microbiota (GM) and intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), the causal relationship between them remains unclear. Hence, we thoroughly investigate their causal relationship by means of a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, aiming to determine the impact of gut microbiota on the risk of developing intervertebral disc degeneration.

## The gut microbiota-brain axis in neurological disorder.
 23.08.2023, _H Ullah, S Arbab, Y Tian, CQ Liu, Y Chen, L Qijie, MIU Khan, IU Hassan, K Li_


The gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in the physiology and pathology of the host. Microbiota communicate with different organs of the organism by synthesizing hormones and regulating body activity. The interaction of the central nervous system (CNS) and gut signaling pathways includes chemical, neural immune and endocrine routes. Alteration or dysbiosis in the gut microbiota leads to different gastrointestinal tract disorders that ultimately impact host physiology because of the abnormal microbial metabolites that stimulate and trigger different physiologic reactions in the host body. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to a change in the bidirectional relationship between the CNS and GM, which is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Increasing preclinical and clinical studies/evidence indicate that gut microbes are a possible susceptibility factor for the progression of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this review, we discuss the crucial connection between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, the signaling pathways of multiple biological systems and the contribution of gut microbiota-related neurological disorders.

## Rosmarinic acid alleviates intestinal inflammatory damage and inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress and smooth muscle contraction abnormalities in intestinal tissues by regulating gut microbiota.
 18.08.2023, _K Li, J Wu, S Xu, X Li, Y Zhang, XJ Gao_


The host-bacterial interactions play the key role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dysbiosis of the intestinal flora can lead to pathological changes in the intestine. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural phenolic acid compound with antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-bacterial activities that has a palliative effect on acute IBD. We have established an in vivo model for mice. Histological staining was performed to directly observe RA alterations in the intestinal tract. The alteration of RA on mouse intestinal flora was observed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, and the effect of RA on intestinal mechanism of action was detected by qPCR and western blot. The results showed that RA had a significant protective effect on the intestine. RA upregulated the abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii and Candidatus Arthromitus sp SFB-mouse-NL and downregulated the abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Escherichia coli, and Romboutsia ilealis. RA downregulated the expressions of ROCK, RhoA, CaM, MLC, MLCK, ZEB1, ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, E-cadherin, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, GRP78, PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, Caspase12, Caspase9, Caspase3, Bax, Cytc, RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL, and upregulated the expression of IL-10 and Bcl-2. These results displayed that RA inhibited the inflammation, which is caused by tight junction damage, by repairing intestinal flora dysbiosis, relieved endoplasmic reticulum stress, inhibited cell death, and corrected smooth muscle contractile dysregulation. The results of this study revealed RA could have a protective effect on the small intestine of mice by regulating intestinal flora. IMPORTANCE Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing, remitting disorder of the gastrointestinal system. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of rosmarinic acid on the intestinal tract. The results showed that RA was effective in reducing inflammatory damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, smooth muscle contraction abnormalities, and regulating intestinal flora disorders.

## Detection of viable commensal bacteria in murine melanoma tumors by culturomics.
 14.08.2023, _CM Phelps, JH Shapira, CR Laughlin, M Meisel_


Emerging evidence suggests the tumor microbiome at gut-distal sites can modulate tumor immunity and response to cancer immunotherapy. However, detection of commensal bacteria at gut-distal tumor sites is challenging given their low abundance. Here, we present a culturomics approach to facilitate recovery of phylogenetically diverse live commensal bacteria within gut-distal melanoma tumors. We describe steps for media preparation, tissue isolation, tissue homogenization, and host cell lysis. We then detail broth expansion culture followed by agar culture and single-colony 16S rRNA sequencing. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Bender and McPherson et al. (2023).1.
