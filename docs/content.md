Metagenomic assembly enables new organism discovery from microbial communities, but it can only capture few abundant organisms from most metagenomes. Here we present MetaPhlAn 4, which integrates information from metagenome assemblies and microbial isolate genomes for more comprehensive metagenomic taxonomic profiling. From a curated collection of 1.01 M prokaryotic reference and metagenome-assembled genomes, we define unique marker genes for 26,970 species-level genome bins, 4,992 of them taxonomically unidentified at the species level. MetaPhlAn 4 explains ~20% more reads in most international human gut microbiomes and &gt;40% in less-characterized environments such as the rumen microbiome and proves more accurate than available alternatives on synthetic evaluations while also reliably quantifying organisms with no cultured isolates. Application of the method to &gt;24,500 metagenomes highlights previously undetected species to be strong biomarkers for host conditions and lifestyles in human and mouse microbiomes and shows that even previously uncharacterized species can be genetically profiled at the resolution of single microbial strains.

## Gut microbial metabolism of 5-ASA diminishes its clinical efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease.
 24.02.2023, _RS Mehta, JR Mayers, Y Zhang, A Bhosle, NR Glasser, LH Nguyen, W Ma, S Bae, T Branck, K Song, L Sebastian, JA Pacheco, HS Seo, C Clish, S Dhe-Paganon, AN Ananthakrishnan, EA Franzosa, EP Balskus, AT Chan, C Huttenhower_


For decades, variability in clinical efficacy of the widely used inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) drug 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) has been attributed, in part, to its acetylation and inactivation by gut microbes. Identification of the responsible microbes and enzyme(s), however, has proved elusive. To uncover the source of this metabolism, we developed a multi-omics workflow combining gut microbiome metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics from the longitudinal IBDMDB cohort of 132 controls and patients with IBD. This associated 12 previously uncharacterized microbial acetyltransferases with 5-ASA inactivation, belonging to two protein superfamilies: thiolases and acyl-CoA N-acyltransferases. In vitro characterization of representatives from both families confirmed the ability of these enzymes to acetylate 5-ASA. A cross-sectional analysis within the discovery cohort and subsequent prospective validation within the independent SPARC IBD cohort (n = 208) found three of these microbial thiolases and one acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase to be epidemiologically associated with an increased risk of treatment failure among 5-ASA users. Together, these data address a longstanding challenge in IBD management, outline a method for the discovery of previously uncharacterized gut microbial activities and advance the possibility of microbiome-based personalized medicine.

_Humans, Virome, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Viruses, Colitis, Ulcerative, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases_
Viruses are increasingly recognised as important components of the human microbiome, fulfilling numerous ecological roles including bacterial predation, immune stimulation, genetic diversification, horizontal gene transfer, microbial interactions, and augmentation of metabolic functions. However, our current view of the human gut virome is tainted by previous sequencing requirements that necessitated the amplification of starting nucleic acids. In this study, we performed an original longitudinal analysis of 40 healthy control, 19 Crohn's disease, and 20 ulcerative colitis viromes over three time points without an amplification bias, which revealed and highlighted the interpersonal individuality of the human gut virome. In contrast to a 16 S rRNA gene analysis of matched samples, we show that α- and β-diversity metrics of unamplified viromes are not as efficient at discerning controls from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, we explored the intrinsic properties of unamplified gut viromes and show there is considerable interpersonal variability in viral taxa, infrequent longitudinal persistence of intrapersonal viruses, and vast fluctuations in the abundance of temporal viruses. Together, these properties of unamplified faecal viromes confound the ability to discern disease associations but significantly advance toward an unbiased and accurate representation of the human gut virome.

Those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia, have a gut microbiome distinct from healthy individuals, but this has only been shown in healthy individuals, not in those exhibiting several risk factors for dementia. Using amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing in a case-control study of 60 older (ages 55-76), obese, predominately female, African American adults, those with MCI (cases) had different gut microbiota profiles than controls. While microbial community diversity was similar between cases and controls, the abundances of specific microbial taxa weren't, such as Parabacteroides distasonis (lower in cases) and Dialister invisus (higher in cases). These differences disappeared after adjusting for markers of oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. Cognitive scores were positively correlated with levels of Akkermansia muciniphila, a bacterium associated with reduced inflammation. Our study shows that gut microbial composition may be associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and MCI in those at high risk for dementia.

 28.02.2023, _GR Aparnasai, M Handa, D Garabadu, R Kumar, PK Kushawaha, R Shukla_


Purpose Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) management involves administering antibiotics that destroy the cell wall and the genesis of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). During the infectious state, the expression of transferrin receptors upregulates on the intestinal epithelial cells, which are considered the site of infection. In the present study, transferrin decorated PLGA nanoparticles encapsulated Moxifloxacin developed for possible targeting of the receptors in the colon. Significance: This study will explore more about the incorporation of transferrin as effective coating material in targeted drug delivery. Method: Nanoparticles prepared using nano-emulsification and surface modification with transferrin were layer by layer methodology and evaluated for PXRD, DSC, FTIR, microscopy, antibacterial activity and cellular uptake. Results: The formulated nanoparticles exhibit a size of ≈170 nm, PDI ≈ 0.25, zeta potential ≈ -4.0 mV, drug loading ≈ 6.8% and entrapment efficiency of 82%. Transferrin-decorated nanoparticles exhibit tailored release for almost 12 h and in vitro antibacterial activity for 14 h. The cellular uptake studies on a RAW264.7 cell line for better determination of transferrin uptake of fabricated nanoparticles. Conclusion: The above studied circumvents around the preparation of transferrin decorated PLGA encumbered Moxifloxacin nanoparticles intended for cIAI-induced sepsis. PLGA nanoparticles provide tailored release of MOX with primary burst and owed by sustained release and confirmed with antibacterial activity studies. The prepared transferrin-coated nanoparticles are stable and effective uptake by RAW264.7. Future studies include the preclinical investigation of these nanoparticles in sepsis-induced murine models.

## A microbiota and dietary metabolite integrates DNA repair and cell death to regulate embryo viability and aneuploidy during aging.

_Animals, Aneuploidy, DNA Repair, Cell Death, Indoles, Microbiota_
During aging, environmental stressors and mutations along with reduced DNA repair cause germ cell aneuploidy and genome instability, which limits fertility and embryo development. Benevolent commensal microbiota and dietary plants secrete indoles, which improve healthspan and reproductive success, suggesting regulation of germ cell quality. We show that indoles prevent aneuploidy and promote DNA repair and embryo viability, which depends on age and genotoxic stress levels and affects embryo quality across generations. In young animals or with low doses of radiation, indoles promote DNA repair and embryo viability; however, in older animals or with high doses of radiation, indoles promote death of the embryo. These studies reveal a previously unknown quality control mechanism by which indole integrates DNA repair and cell death responses to preclude germ cell aneuploidy and ensure transgenerational genome integrity. Such regulation affects healthy aging, reproductive senescence, cancer, and the evolution of genetic diversity in invertebrates and vertebrates.

## A longitudinal survey in the wild reveals major shifts in fish host microbiota after parasite infection.

Recent studies have highlighted associations between diseases and host microbiota. It is yet extremely challenging -especially under natural conditions- to clarify whether the host microbiota promotes future infections, or whether changes in host microbiota result from infections. Nonetheless, deciphering between these two processes is essential for highlighting the role of microbes in disease progression. We longitudinally surveyed, in the wild, the microbiota of individual fish hosts (Leuciscus burdigalensis) both before and after infection by a crustacean ectoparasite (Tracheliastes polycolpus). We found a striking association between parasite infection and the host microbiota composition restricted to the fins the parasite anchored. We clearly demonstrated that infections by the parasite induced a shift in (and did not result from) the host fin microbiota. Fin microbiota further got similar to that of the adult stage, and the free-living infective stage of the parasite during infection with a predominance of the Burkholderiaceae bacteria family. This suggests that Burkholderiaceae bacteria is involved in a co-infection process and possibly facilitate T. polycolpus infection. We reveal novel mechanistic insights for understanding the role of the microbiota in host-parasite interactions, which has implications for predicting the progression of diseases in natural host populations.

The realization of the "microbiota-gut-brain" axis plays a critical role in neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, is advancing rapidly. Matrine is a natural bioactive compound, which has been found to possess potential antidepressant effect. However, the underlying mechanisms of regulation of the "microbiota-gut-brain" axis in the treatment of depression by oral matrine remain elusive.

For different breeds of dogs with acute diarrhea, the gut microbiota and metabolome profiles are unclear. This prospective observational study analyzed the gut microbiomes of poodles with acute diarrhea and Labrador retrievers with acute diarrhea based on 16S amplicon sequencing, with respective healthy dogs as controls. Fecal non-target metabolomics and metagenomics were performed on poodles with acute diarrhea. This study found that the diversity and structure of the microbial community differed significantly between the two breeds in cohorts of healthy dogs. Two breeds of dogs with acute diarrhea demonstrated different changes in microbial communities and metabolic functions. The metabolism of starch and sucrose was significantly decreased in dogs with acute diarrhea, which may be attributed to the reduced activity of dextran dextrinase. Non-targeted metabolomics identified 21 abnormal metabolic pathways exhibited by dogs with acute diarrhea, including starch, amino acid, bile acid metabolism, etc., and were closely related to specific intestinal flora. This study provided new insights into breed specificity and the development of dietary treatment strategy in canine gastrointestinal disease.

_Microbiota, Bacteria, Seawater, Temperature, Adaptation, Physiological, Esterases_
Microbial communities respond to temperature with physiological adaptation and compositional turnover. Whether thermal selection of enzymes explains marine microbiome plasticity in response to temperature remains unresolved. By quantifying the thermal behaviour of seven functionally-independent enzyme classes (esterase, extradiol dioxygenase, phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, nuclease, transaminase, and aldo-keto reductase) in native proteomes of marine sediment microbiomes from the Irish Sea to the southern Red Sea, we record a significant effect of the mean annual temperature (MAT) on enzyme response in all cases. Activity and stability profiles of 228 esterases and 5 extradiol dioxygenases from sediment and seawater across 70 locations worldwide validate this thermal pattern. Modelling the esterase phase transition temperature as a measure of structural flexibility confirms the observed relationship with MAT. Furthermore, when considering temperature variability in sites with non-significantly different MATs, the broadest range of enzyme thermal behaviour and the highest growth plasticity of the enriched heterotrophic bacteria occur in samples with the widest annual thermal variability. These results indicate that temperature-driven enzyme selection shapes microbiome thermal plasticity and that thermal variability finely tunes such processes and should be considered alongside MAT in forecasting microbial community thermal response.

 25.02.2023, _Q Wang, Z Liu, A Ma, Z Li, B Liu, Q Ma_


The human microbiome is intimately related to cancer biology and plays a vital role in the efficacy of cancer treatments, including immunotherapy. Extraordinary evidence has revealed that several microbes influence tumor development through interaction with the host immune system, that is, immuno-oncology-microbiome (IOM). This review focuses on the intratumoral microbiome in IOM and describes the available data and computational methods for discovering biological insights of microbial profiling from host bulk, single-cell, and spatial sequencing data. Critical challenges in data analysis and integration are discussed. Specifically, the microorganisms associated with cancer and cancer treatment in the context of IOM are collected and integrated from the literature. Lastly, we provide our perspectives for future directions in IOM research.

Quantifying the role of genetics via construction of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) is deemed a resourceful tool to enable and promote effective obesity prevention strategies. The present paper proposes a novel methodology for PRS extraction and presents the first PRS for body mass index (BMI) in a Greek population. A novel pipeline for PRS derivation was used to analyze genetic data from a unified database of three cohorts of Greek adults. The pipeline spans various steps of the process, from iterative dataset splitting to training and test partitions, calculation of summary statistics and PRS extraction, up to PRS aggregation and stabilization, achieving higher evaluation metrics. Using data from 2185 participants, implementation of the pipeline enabled consecutive repetitions in splitting training and testing samples and resulted in a 343-single nucleotide polymorphism PRS yielding an R2 = 0.3241 (beta = 1.011, p-value = 4 × 10-193) for BMI. PRS-included variants displayed a variety of associations with known traits (i.e., blood cell count, gut microbiome, lifestyle parameters). The proposed methodology led to creation of the first-ever PRS for BMI in Greek adults and aims at promoting a facilitating approach to reliable PRS development and integration in healthcare practice.

## Latent dirichlet allocation for double clustering (LDA-DC): discovering patients phenotypes and cell populations within a single Bayesian framework.
 27.02.2023, _EE Hachem, N Sokolovska, H Soula_


_Humans, Bayes Theorem, Cluster Analysis_
Current clinical routines rely more and more on "omics" data such as flow cytometry data from host and microbiota. Cohorts variability in addition to patients' heterogeneity and huge dimensions make it difficult to understand underlying structure of the data and decipher pathologies. Patients stratification and diagnostics from such complex data are extremely challenging. There is an acute need to develop novel statistical machine learning methods that are robust with respect to the data heterogeneity, efficient from the computational viewpoint, and can be understood by human experts.
