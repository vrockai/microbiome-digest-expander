## A high-resolution transcriptome map identifies small RNA regulation of metabolism in the gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
 22.07.2020, _D Ryan, L Jenniches, S Reichardt, L Barquist, AJ Westermann_


Bacteria of the genus Bacteroides are common members of the human intestinal microbiota and important degraders of polysaccharides in the gut. Among them, the species Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has emerged as the model organism for functional microbiota research. Here, we use differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) to generate a single-nucleotide resolution transcriptome map of B. thetaiotaomicron grown under defined laboratory conditions. An online browser, called 'Theta-Base' ( www.helmholtz-hiri.de/en/datasets/bacteroides ), is launched to interrogate the obtained gene expression data and annotations of ~4500 transcription start sites, untranslated regions, operon structures, and 269 noncoding RNA elements. Among the latter is GibS, a conserved, 145 nt-long small RNA that is highly expressed in the presence of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine as sole carbon source. We use computational predictions and experimental data to determine the secondary structure of GibS and identify its target genes. Our results indicate that sensing of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine induces GibS expression, which in turn modifies the transcript levels of metabolic enzymes.

Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in faeces of patients with COVID-19, the activity and infectivity of the virus in the GI tract during disease course is largely unknown. We investigated temporal transcriptional activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its association with longitudinal faecal microbiome alterations in patients with COVID-19.

## High microbiota reactivity of adult human intestinal IgA requires somatic mutations.
 08.07.2020, _J Kabbert, J Benckert, T Rollenske, TCA Hitch, T Clavel, V Cerovic, H Wardemann, O Pabst_


The gut is home to the body's largest population of plasma cells. In healthy individuals, IgA is the dominating isotype, whereas patients with inflammatory bowel disease also produce high concentrations of IgG. In the gut lumen, secretory IgA binds pathogens and toxins but also the microbiota. However, the antigen specificity of IgA and IgG for the microbiota and underlying mechanisms of antibody binding to bacteria are largely unknown. Here we show that microbiota binding is a defining property of human intestinal antibodies in both healthy and inflamed gut. Some bacterial taxa were commonly targeted by different monoclonal antibodies, whereas others selectively bound single antibodies. Interestingly, individual human monoclonal antibodies from both healthy and inflamed intestines bound phylogenetically unrelated bacterial species. This microbiota cross-species reactivity did not correlate with antibody polyreactivity but was crucially dependent on the accumulation of somatic mutations. Therefore, our data suggest that a system of affinity-matured, microbiota cross-species-reactive IgA is a common aspect of SIgA-microbiota interactions in the gut.

Comprehensive, high-quality reference genomes are required for functional characterization and taxonomic assignment of the human gut microbiota. We present the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection, comprising 204,938 nonredundant genomes from 4,644 gut prokaryotes. These genomes encode &gt;170 million protein sequences, which we collated in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalog. The UHGP more than doubles the number of gut proteins in comparison to those present in the Integrated Gene Catalog. More than 70% of the UHGG species lack cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP lack functional annotations. Intraspecies genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which are specific to individual human populations. The UHGG and UHGP collections will enable studies linking genotypes to phenotypes in the human gut microbiome.

## Butyrate producing colonic Clostridiales metabolise human milk oligosaccharides and cross feed on mucin via conserved pathways.
 10.07.2020, _MJ Pichler, C Yamada, B Shuoker, C Alvarez-Silva, A Gotoh, ML Leth, E Schoof, T Katoh, M Sakanaka, T Katayama, C Jin, NG Karlsson, M Arumugam, S Fushinobu, M Abou Hachem_


The early life human gut microbiota exerts life-long health effects on the host, but the mechanisms underpinning its assembly remain elusive. Particularly, the early colonization of Clostridiales from the Roseburia-Eubacterium group, associated with protection from colorectal cancer, immune- and metabolic disorders is enigmatic. Here, we describe catabolic pathways that support the growth of Roseburia and Eubacterium members on distinct human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). The HMO pathways, which include enzymes with a previously unknown structural fold and specificity, were upregulated together with additional glycan-utilization loci during growth on selected HMOs and in co-cultures with Akkermansia muciniphila on mucin, suggesting an additional role in enabling cross-feeding and access to mucin O-glycans. Analyses of 4599 Roseburia genomes underscored the preponderance and diversity of the HMO utilization loci within the genus. The catabolism of HMOs by butyrate-producing Clostridiales may contribute to the competitiveness of this group during the weaning-triggered maturation of the microbiota.

## Gut microbiota composition modulates inflammation and structure of the vagal afferent pathway.
 19.07.2020, _JS Kim, RA Kirkland, SH Lee, CR Cawthon, KW Rzepka, DM Minaya, G de Lartigue, K Czaja, C Serre_


Vagal afferent neurons (VAN), located in the nodose ganglion (NG) innervate the gut and terminate in the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) in the brainstem. They are the primary sensory neurons integrating gut-derived signals to regulate meal size. Chronic high-fat diet (HFD) consumption impairs vagally mediated satiety, resulting in overfeeding. There is evidence that HFD consumption leads to alterations in both vagal nerve function and structural integrity. HFD also leads to marked gut microbiota dysbiosis; in rodent models, dysbiosis is sufficient to induce weight gain. In this study, we investigated the effect of microbiota dysbiosis on gut-brain vagal innervation independently of diet. To do so, we recolonized microbiota-depleted rats with gastrointestinal (GI) contents isolated from donor animals fed either a HFD (45 or 60% fat) or a low fat diet (LFD, 13% fat). We used two different depletion models while maintaining the animals on LFD: 1) conventionally raised Fischer and Wistar rats that underwent a depletion paradigm using an antibiotic cocktail and 2) germ free (GF) raised Fischer rats. Following recolonization, receiver animals were designated as ConvLF and ConvHF. Fecal samples were collected throughout these studies and analyzed via 16S Illumina sequencing. In both models, bacteria that were identified as characteristic of HFD were successfully transferred to recipient animals. Three weeks post-colonization, ConvHF rats showed significant increases in ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba1) positive immune cells in the NG compared to ConvLF animals. Additionally, using isolectin B4 (IB4) staining to identify c-fibers, we found that, compared to ConvLF animals, ConvHF rats displayed decreased innervation at the level of the medial NTS; c-fibers at this level are believed to be primarily of vagal origin. This alteration in vagal structure was associated with a loss in satiety induced by the gut peptide cholecystokinin (CCK). Increased presence of immunocompetent Iba1+ cells along the gut-brain axis and alterations in NTS innervation were still evident in ConvHF rats compared to ConvLF animals 12 weeks post-colonization and were associated with increases in food intake and body weight (BW). We conclude from these data that microbiota dysbiosis can alter gut-brain vagal innervation, potentially via recruitment and/or activation of immune cells.

## TNFα regulates intestinal organoids from mice with both defined and conventional microbiota.
 21.07.2020, _L Sun, D Rollins, Y Qi, J Fredericks, TJ Mansell, A Jergens, GJ Phillips, M Wannemuehler, Q Wang_


Cytokines are key factors affecting the fate of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and effective reagents to manipulate ISCs for research purpose. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a cytokine produced primarily by monocytes and macrophages. It can induce apoptotic cell death and inflammation, and to inhibit tumorigenesis and viral replication. Additionally, TNFα has been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is therefore important to identify the mechanism by which individual cytokines affect particular cell types. For this purpose, we used both conventional (CONV) and altered Schaedler flora (ASF) C3H/HeN mice to elucidate the effect of different microbial populations (complex versus defined) on growth of miniguts derived from two different intestinal environments. Furthermore, we studied the effects of different concentrations of TNFα extracted from the lymph and spleen on the growth and viability of ISCs recovered from mice bearing the ASF or CONV microbiota. The effect of TNFα on miniguts growth depends not only on the source and concentration, but also on the intestinal microenvironment from which the ISCs were derived. The findings suggest that TNFα influenced the proliferation of miniguts derived from ISCs and, therefore, modulates mucosal homeostasis of the host.

## Nutrient and microbial water quality of the upper Ganga River, India: identification of pollution sources.
 22.07.2020, _MJ Bowes, DS Read, H Joshi, R Sinha, A Ansari, M Hazra, M Simon, R Vishwakarma, LK Armstrong, DJE Nicholls, HD Wickham, J Ward, LR Carvalho, HG Rees_

The Ganga River is facing mounting environmental pressures due to rapidly increasing human population, urbanisation, industrialisation and agricultural intensification, resulting in worsening water quality, ecological status and impacts on human health. A combined inorganic chemical, algal and bacterial survey (using flow cytometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing) along the upper and middle Ganga (from the Himalayan foothills to Kanpur) was conducted under pre-monsoon conditions. The upper Ganga had total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved nitrogen concentrations of less than 100 μg l-1 and 1.0 mg l-1, but water quality declined at Kannauj (TP = 420 μg l-1) due to major nutrient pollution inputs from human-impacted tributaries (principally the Ramganga and Kali Rivers). The phosphorus and nitrogen loads in these two tributaries and the Yamuna were dominated by soluble reactive phosphorus and ammonium, with high bacterial loads and large numbers of taxa indicative of pathogen and faecal organisms, strongly suggesting sewage pollution sources. The high nutrient concentrations, low flows, warm water and high solar radiation resulted in major algal blooms in the Kali and Ramganga, which greatly impacted the Ganga. Microbial communities were dominated by members of the Phylum Proteobacteria, Bacteriodetes and Cyanobacteria, with communities showing a clear upstream to downstream transition in community composition. To improve the water quality of the middle Ganga, and decrease ecological and human health risks, future mitigation must reduce urban wastewater inputs in the urbanised tributaries of the Ramganga, Kali and Yamuna Rivers.

## Global warming shifts the composition of the abundant bacterial phyllosphere microbiota as indicated by a cultivation-dependent and -independent study of the grassland phyllosphere of a long-term warming field experiment.
 14.07.2020, _EL Aydogan, O Budich, M Hardt, YH Choi, AB Jansen-Willems, G Moser, C Müller, P Kämpfer, SP Glaeser_


The leaf-colonizing bacterial microbiota was studied in a long-term warming experiment on a permanent grassland, which had been continuously exposed to increased surface temperature (+2°C) for more than six years. Two abundant plant species, Arrhenatherum elatius and Galium album, were studied. Surface warming reduced stomata opening and changed leaf metabolite profiles. Leaf surface colonization and the concentration of leaf-associated bacterial cells were not affected. However, bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon Illumina sequencing showed significant temperature effects on the plant species-specific phyllosphere microbiota. Warming partially affected the concentrations of cultured bacteria and had a significant effect on the composition of most abundant cultured plant species-specific bacteria. The abundance of Sphingomonas was significantly reduced. Sphingomonas isolates from warmed plots represented different phylotypes, had different physiological traits and were better adapted to higher temperatures. Among Methylobacterium isolates, a novel phylotype with a specific mxaFtype was cultured from plants of warmed plots while the most abundant phylotype cultured from control plots was strongly reduced. This study clearly showed a correlation of long-term surface warming with changes in the plant physiology and the development of a physiologically and genetically adapted phyllosphere microbiota.
