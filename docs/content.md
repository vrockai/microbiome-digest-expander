## Toxic Relationships Described by People With Breast Cancer on Reddit: Topic Modeling Study.
 23.02.2024, _CA Davidson, R Booth, KT Jackson, T Mantler_


Social support is essential to promoting optimal health outcomes for women with breast cancer. However, an estimated 12% of women with breast cancer simultaneously experience intimate partner violence (IPV; physical, psychological, or sexual abuse by an intimate partner). Women who experience IPV during breast cancer may lack traditional social support, and thus seek out alternative sources of support. Online community forums, such as Reddit, can provide accessible social connections within breast cancer-specific communities. However, it is largely unknown how women with breast cancer use Reddit to describe and seek support for experiences of IPV.

_Humans, Peri-Implantitis, Microbiota_
We performed a longitudinal shotgun metagenomic investigation of the plaque microbiome associated with peri-implant diseases in a cohort of 91 subjects with 320 quality-controlled metagenomes. Through recently improved taxonomic profiling methods, we identified the most discriminative species between healthy and diseased subjects at baseline, evaluated their change over time, and provided evidence that clinical treatment had a positive effect on plaque microbiome composition in patients affected by mucositis and peri-implantitis.

## Decrease in Sperm Parameters in the 21st Century: Obesity, Lifestyle, or Environmental Factors? An Updated Narrative Review.
 23.02.2024, _R Sciorio, L Tramontano, M Adel, S Fleming_


Semen quality represents a compelling factor for fertility, and delineating the normal values has proven difficult. In the last four decades, several authors have reported a noticeable decline in sperm parameters. Also, studies investigating 'time to pregnancy' have shown that fecundity begins to be reduced when sperm numbers decrease below 30 million, even though according to the 6th edition of the WHO manual, the normal value is currently 16 million/mL or 39 million per ejaculate. There exists sufficient data to suggest a decline in sperm counts over time, even though the clear reason for this adverse trend is not well established, but some associations have been hypothesised, such as maternal smoking during pregnancy. Additional potential factors have yet to be fully illustrated but involve poor diet, increased obesity, and exposure to environmental toxins. Moreover, the change in environmental conditions and more common exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as pesticides and herbicides, as well as bisphenol A, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls, and heavy metals, starting from prenatal life and continuing into adulthood, may exhibit probable features explaining the reduction in sperm parameters. Therefore, the main goal of this narrative review is to furnish an overview of the possible effects of exposure to EDCs on testicular function and spermatogenesis and, also, to summarise the evidence regarding a decrease in sperm quality and examine its potential consequences.

## Longitudinal quantification of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis reveals late colonization in the infant gut independent of maternal milk HMO composition.
 06.02.2024, _D Ennis, S Shmorak, E Jantscher-Krenn, M Yassour_


_Infant, Female, Humans, Health Maintenance Organizations, Longitudinal Studies, Milk, Human, Bifidobacterium, Oligosaccharides, Bifidobacterium longum_
Breast milk contains human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) that cannot be digested by infants, yet nourish their developing gut microbiome. While Bifidobacterium are the best-known utilizers of individual HMOs, a longitudinal study examining the evolving microbial community at high-resolution coupled with mothers' milk HMO composition is lacking. Here, we developed a high-throughput method to quantify Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (BL. infantis), a proficient HMO-utilizer, and applied it to a longitudinal cohort consisting of 21 mother-infant dyads. We observed substantial changes in the infant gut microbiome over the course of several months, while the HMO composition in mothers' milk remained relatively stable. Although Bifidobacterium species significantly influenced sample variation, no specific HMOs correlated with Bifidobacterium species abundance. Surprisingly, we found that BL. infantis colonization began late in the breastfeeding period both in our cohort and in other geographic locations, highlighting the importance of focusing on BL. infantis dynamics in the infant gut.

_Humans, Case-Control Studies, Sports, Exercise, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Athletic Performance_
The influence of human gut microbiota on health and disease is now commonly appreciated. Therefore, it is not surprising that microbiome research has found interest in the sports community, hoping to improve health and optimize performance. Comparative studies found new species or pathways that were more enriched in elites than sedentary controls. In addition, sport-specific and performance-level-specific microbiome features have been identified. However, the results remain inconclusive and indicate the need for further assessment. In this case-control study, we tested two athletic populations (i.e. strength athletes, endurance athletes) and a non-athletic, but physically active, control group across two acute exercise bouts, separated by a 2-week period, that measured explosive and high intensity fitness level (repeated 30-s all-out Wingate test (WT)) and cardiorespiratory fitness level (Bruce Treadmill Test). While we did not identify any group differences in alpha and beta diversity or significant differential abundance of microbiome components at baseline, one-third of the species identified were unique to each group. Longitudinal sample (pre- and post-exercise) analysis revealed an abundance of Alistipes communis in the strength group during the WT and 88 species with notable between-group differences during the Bruce Test. SparCC recognized Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis, short-chain fatty acid producers with probiotic properties, species strongly associated with VO2max. Ultimately, we identified several taxa with different baseline abundances and longitudinal changes when comparing individuals based on their VO2max, average power, and maximal power parameters. Our results confirmed that the health status of individuals are consistent with assumptions about microbiome health. Furthermore, our findings indicate that microbiome features are associated with better performance previously identified in elite athletes.

## The impact of iron supplementation on the preterm neonatal gut microbiome: A pilot study.
 23.02.2024, _M VanOrmer, M Thompson, M Thoene, JJ Riethoven, SK Natarajan, C Hanson, A Anderson-Berry_


_Infant, Infant, Newborn, Humans, Infant, Premature, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Pilot Projects, Dysbiosis, Iron, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Dietary Supplements, Feces_
The gastrointestinal microbiome in preterm infants exhibits significant influence on optimal outcomes-with dysbiosis shown to substantially increase the risk of the life-threatening necrotizing enterocolitis. Iron is a vital nutrient especially during the perinatal window of rapid hemoglobin production, tissue growth, and foundational neurodevelopment. However, excess colonic iron exhibits potent oxidation capacity and alters the gut microbiome-potentially facilitating the proliferation of pathological bacterial strains. Breastfed preterm infants routinely receive iron supplementation starting 14 days after delivery and are highly vulnerable to morbidities associated with gastrointestinal dysbiosis. Therefore, we set out to determine if routine iron supplementation alters the preterm gut microbiome.

## Insights into gut microbiomes in stem cell transplantation by comprehensive shotgun long-read sequencing.
 22.02.2024, _P Spohr, S Scharf, A Rommerskirchen, B Henrich, P Jäger, GW Klau, R Haas, A Dilthey, K Pfeffer_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Microbiota, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Bacteria, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Fungi, DNA, Ribosomal, Metagenomics_
The gut microbiome is a diverse ecosystem, dominated by bacteria; however, fungi, phages/viruses, archaea, and protozoa are also important members of the gut microbiota. Exploration of taxonomic compositions beyond bacteria as well as an understanding of the interaction between the bacteriome with the other members is limited using 16S rDNA sequencing. Here, we developed a pipeline enabling the simultaneous interrogation of the gut microbiome (bacteriome, mycobiome, archaeome, eukaryome, DNA virome) and of antibiotic resistance genes based on optimized long-read shotgun metagenomics protocols and custom bioinformatics. Using our pipeline we investigated the longitudinal composition of the gut microbiome in an exploratory clinical study in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT; n = 31). Pre-transplantation microbiomes exhibited a 3-cluster structure, characterized by Bacteroides spp. /Phocaeicola spp., mixed composition and Enterococcus abundances. We revealed substantial inter-individual and temporal variabilities of microbial domain compositions, human DNA, and antibiotic resistance genes during the course of alloHSCT. Interestingly, viruses and fungi accounted for substantial proportions of microbiome content in individual samples. In the course of HSCT, bacterial strains were stable or newly acquired. Our results demonstrate the disruptive potential of alloHSCTon the gut microbiome and pave the way for future comprehensive microbiome studies based on long-read metagenomics.

## Donor-recipient intermicrobial interactions impact transfer of subspecies and fecal microbiota transplantation outcome.

Studies on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have reported inconsistent connections between clinical outcomes and donor strain engraftment. Analyses of subspecies-level crosstalk and its influences on lineage transfer in metagenomic FMT datasets have proved challenging, as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are generally not linked and are often absent. Here, we utilized species genome bin (SGB), which employs co-abundance binning, to investigate subspecies-level microbiome dynamics in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who had gastrointestinal comorbidities and underwent encapsulated FMT (Chinese Clinical Trial: 2100043906). We found that interactions between donor and recipient microbes, which were overwhelmingly phylogenetically divergent, were important for subspecies transfer and positive clinical outcomes. Additionally, a donor-recipient SGB match was indicative of a high likelihood of strain transfer. Importantly, these ecodynamics were shared across FMT datasets encompassing multiple diseases. Collectively, these findings provide detailed insight into specific microbial interactions and dynamics that determine FMT success.

## The gut ileal mucosal virome is disturbed in patients with Crohn's disease and exacerbates intestinal inflammation in mice.
 22.02.2024, _Z Cao, D Fan, Y Sun, Z Huang, Y Li, R Su, F Zhang, Q Li, H Yang, F Zhang, Y Miao, P Lan, X Wu, T Zuo_


Gut bacteriome dysbiosis is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Crohn's disease (CD) is an IBD subtype with extensive mucosal inflammation, yet the mucosal virome, an empirical modulator of the bacteriome and mucosal immunity, remains largely unclear regarding its composition and role. Here, we exploited trans-cohort CD patients and healthy individuals to compositionally and functionally investigate the small bowel (terminal ileum) virome and bacteriome. The CD ileal virome was characterised by an under-representation of both lytic and temperate bacteriophages (especially those targeting bacterial pathogens), particularly in patients with flare-up. Meanwhile, the virome-bacteriome ecology in CD ileal mucosa was featured by a lack of Bifidobacterium- and Lachnospiraceae-led mutualistic interactions between bacteria and bacteriophages; surprisingly it was more pronounced in CD remission than flare-up, underlining the refractory and recurrent nature of mucosal inflammation in CD. Lastly, we substantiated that ileal virions from CD patients causally exacerbated intestinal inflammation in IBD mouse models, by reshaping a gut virome-bacteriome ecology preceding intestinal inflammation (microbial trigger) and augmenting microbial sensing/defence pathways in the intestine cells (host response). Altogether, our results highlight the significance of mucosal virome in CD pathogenesis and importance of mucosal virome restoration in CD therapeutics.

## Five Species of Wild Freshwater Sport Fish in Wisconsin, USA, Reveal Highly Diverse Viromes.
 23.02.2024, _CE Ford, CD Dunn, EM Leis, WA Thiel, TL Goldberg_


Studies of marine fish have revealed distant relatives of viruses important to global fish and animal health, but few such studies exist for freshwater fish. To investigate whether freshwater fish also host such viruses, we characterized the viromes of five wild species of freshwater fish in Wisconsin, USA: bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), brown trout (Salmo trutta), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), northern pike (Esox lucius), and walleye (Sander vitreus). We analyzed 103 blood serum samples collected during a state-wide survey from 2016 to 2020 and used a metagenomic approach for virus detection to identify known and previously uncharacterized virus sequences. We then characterized viruses phylogenetically and quantified prevalence, richness, and relative abundance for each virus. Within these viromes, we identified 19 viruses from 11 viral families: Amnoonviridae, Circoviridae, Coronaviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Peribunyaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, Matonaviridae, Narnaviridae, Nudnaviridae, and Spinareoviridae, 17 of which were previously undescribed. Among these viruses was the first fish-associated coronavirus from the Gammacoronavirus genus, which was present in 11/15 (73%) of S. vitreus. These results demonstrate that, similar to marine fish, freshwater fish also harbor diverse relatives of viruses important to the health of fish and other animals, although it currently remains unknown what effect, if any, the viruses we identified may have on fish health.

## No potential causal link between HP infection and IBD: A 2way Mendelian randomization study.
 23.02.2024, _K Yang, Y Ding, J Chen, X Sun_


Recent epidemiological research suggests a possible negative correlation between Helicobacter pylori infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, conflicting studies have provided unclear evidence regarding these causal relationships. Therefore, recommending specific prevention and treatment strategies for H. pylori infection and IBD is challenging. We used various antibodies (anti-H. pylori IgG, VacA, and GroEl) related to H. pylori infection as indicators. We acquired relevant genetic variants from public databases within the Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) dataset using IBDs tool variables from 2 different GWAS datasets. We thoroughly examined the data and screened for IVs that fulfilled these criteria. Subsequently, Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted to predict the potential causality between the 2. To ensure the accuracy and robustness of our results, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses. Based on our comprehensive MR analysis, no potential causal relationship was observed between H. pylori infection and IBD. Across various methodologies, including IVW, MR-Egger, and weighted median, our findings showed P values &gt; .05. The only exception was observed in the reverse MR analysis using the MR-Egger method, which yielded a P value of &lt; .05. However, because the IVW method is considered the most statistically significant method for MR, and its P value was &gt; .05, we do not believe that a potential causal relationship exists between them. Our sensitivity analysis did not suggest significant horizontal pleiotropism. Although heterogeneity was detected in the analysis of IBD (IIBDGC source) versus H. pylori GroEL antibody levels (MR-Egger, Qp = 0.038; IVW, Qp = 0.043), the results remained reliable because we selected IVW as a random-effects model in our MR analysis method. Based on our MR research, no direct correlation was observed between H. pylori infection and IBD risk. This implies that eradicating H. pylori may not provide substantial benefits in preventing or treating regional IBD, and vice versa. Nevertheless, the use of H. pylori serological index substitution has limitations, and further research using histological diagnosis and additional MR studies is required to comprehensively assess the link between H. pylori infection and IBD.

## Importance of differential diagnosis of EBV mucocutaneous ulcer and EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A case report.
 23.02.2024, _YR Hong, JS Kwon, HJ Ahn, SY Han, E Cho, BE Kim_


Epstein-Barr virus mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCUs) were officially recognized as a clinicopathologic entity in the 2017 revision of the World Health Organization classification, which often occurs in the elderly or in immunosuppressive condition presented as an isolated ulcerative lesion. EBVMCUs are defined as "shallow, sharply circumscribed, mucosal or cutaneous ulcers with underlying polymorphous infiltration." It mostly involves oral mucosa, but some appear in skin or gastrointestinal tract. Typically, patients with EBVMCUs display a slow disease progression and may even undergo spontaneous regression.

## Decoding muscle-resident Schwann cell dynamics during neuromuscular junction remodeling.
 19.02.2024, _SD Guzman, A Abu-Mahfouz, CS Davis, LP Ruiz, PC Macpherson, SV Brooks_


Understanding neuromuscular junction (NMJ) repair mechanisms is essential for addressing degenerative neuromuscular conditions. Here, we focus on the role of muscle-resident Schwann cells in NMJ reinnervation. In young Sod1 -/- mice, a model of progressive NMJ degeneration, we identified a clear NMJ 'regenerative window' that allowed us to define regulators of reinnervation and crossing Sod1 -/- mice with S100GFP -tg mice permitted visualization and analysis of Schwann cells. High-resolution imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing provide a detailed analysis of Schwann cell number, morphology, and transcriptome revealing multiple subtypes, including a previously unrecognized terminal Schwann cell (tSC) population expressing a synapse promoting signature. We also discovered a novel SPP1-driven cellular interaction between myelin Schwann cells and tSCs and show that it promotes tSC proliferation and reinnervation following nerve injury in wild type mice. Our findings offer important insights into molecular regulators critical in NMJ reinnervation that are mediated through tSCs to maintain NMJ function.
