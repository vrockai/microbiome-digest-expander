This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Gestational diabetes augments group B Streptococcus infection by disrupting maternal immunity and the vaginal microbiota.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a pervasive perinatal pathogen, yet factors driving GBS dissemination in utero are poorly defined. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a complication marked by dysregulated immunity and maternal microbial dysbiosis, increases risk for GBS perinatal disease. Using a murine GDM model of GBS colonization and perinatal transmission, we find that GDM mice display greater GBS in utero dissemination and subsequently worse neonatal outcomes. Dual-RNA sequencing reveals differential GBS adaptation to the GDM reproductive tract, including a putative glycosyltransferase (yfhO), and altered host responses. GDM immune disruptions include reduced uterine natural killer cell activation, impaired recruitment to placentae, and altered maternofetal cytokines. Lastly, we observe distinct vaginal microbial taxa associated with GDM status and GBS invasive disease status. Here, we show a model of GBS dissemination in GDM hosts that recapitulates several clinical aspects and identifies multiple host and bacterial drivers of GBS perinatal disease.

Ruminant gut microbiota are critical in ecological adaptation, evolution, and nutrition utilization because it regulates energy metabolism, promotes nutrient absorption, and improves immune function. To study the functional roles of key gut microbiota in sheep and goats, it is essential to construct reference microbial gene catalogs and high-quality microbial genomes database.

## The impact of microplastics polystyrene on the microscopic structure of mouse intestine, tight junction genes and gut microbiota.

Microplastics, which are tiny plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter, are widely present in the environment, have become a serious threat to aquatic life and human health, potentially causing ecosystem disorders and health problems. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of microplastics, specifically microplastics-polystyrene (MPs-PS), on the structural integrity, gene expression related to tight junctions, and gut microbiota in mice. A total of 24 Kunming mice aged 30 days were randomly assigned into four groups: control male (CM), control female (CF), PS-exposed male (PSM), and PS-exposed female (PSF)(n = 6). There were significant differences in villus height, width, intestinal surface area, and villus height to crypt depth ratio (V/C) between the PS group and the control group(C) (p &lt;0.05). Gene expression analysis demonstrated the downregulation of Claudin-1, Claudin-2, Claudin-15, and Occludin, in both duodenum and jejunum of the PS group (p &lt; 0.05). Analysis of microbial species using 16S rRNA sequencing indicated decreased diversity in the PSF group, as well as reduced diversity in the PSM group at various taxonomic levels. Beta diversity analysis showed a significant difference in gut microbiota distribution between the PS-exposed and C groups (R2 = 0.113, p&lt;0.01), with this difference being more pronounced among females exposed to MPs-PS. KEGG analysis revealed enrichment of differential microbiota mainly involved in seven signaling pathways, such as nucleotide metabolism(p&lt;0.05). The relative abundance ratio of transcriptional pathways was significantly increased for the PSF group (p&lt;0.01), while excretory system pathways were for PSM group(p&lt;0.05). Overall findings suggest that MPs-PS exhibit a notable sex-dependent impact on mouse gut microbiota, with a stronger effect observed among females; reduced expression of tight junction genes may be associated with dysbiosis, particularly elevated levels of Prevotellaceae.

## Fluoroscopic sniff test as a diagnostic tool for phrenic nerve injury in patients with traumatic brachial plexus injury.
 07.06.2024, _P Watanapokasin, Y Monteerarat, M Ongsiriporn, R Limthongthang, T Vathana, P Laohaprasitiporn_


Traumatic brachial plexus injury (BPI) is a high-morbidity condition with an escalating incidence. One of the treatment options is neurotization using the ipsilateral phrenic nerve. Therefore, diagnosis of nerve dysfunction is a crucial step in preoperative planning. This study aimed to assess the accuracy and reliability of the fluoroscopic sniff test for preoperative diagnosis of phrenic nerve injury in patients with traumatic BPI.

Mammalian intestine harbors a mass of phages that play important roles in maintaining gut microbial ecosystem and host health. Pig has become a common model for biomedical research and provides a large amount of meat for human consumption. However, the knowledge of gut phages in pigs is still limited.
