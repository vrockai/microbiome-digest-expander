This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Key determinants of success in fecal microbiota transplantation: From microbiome to clinic.
 11.05.2023, _S Porcari, N Benech, M Valles-Colomer, N Segata, A Gasbarrini, G Cammarota, H Sokol, G Ianiro_


Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has achieved satisfactory results in preventing the recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection, but these positive outcomes have only been partially replicated in other diseases. Several factors influence FMT success, including those related to donors and recipients (including diversity and specific composition of the gut microbiome, immune system, and host genetics) as well as to working protocols (fecal amount and number of infusions, route of delivery, and adjuvant treatments). Moreover, initial evidence suggests that the clinical success of FMT may be related to the degree of donor microbial engraftment. The application of cutting-edge technologies for microbiome assessment, along with changes in the current vision of fecal transplants, are expected to improve FMT protocols and outcomes. Here, we review the key determinants of FMT success and insights and strategies that will enable a close integration of lab-based and clinical approaches for increasing FMT success.

## Profiling the human intestinal environment under physiological conditions.
 11.05.2023, _D Shalon, RN Culver, JA Grembi, J Folz, PV Treit, H Shi, FA Rosenberger, L Dethlefsen, X Meng, E Yaffe, A Aranda-Díaz, PE Geyer, JB Mueller-Reif, S Spencer, AD Patterson, G Triadafilopoulos, SP Holmes, M Mann, O Fiehn, DA Relman, KC Huang_


The spatiotemporal structure of the human microbiome1,2, proteome3 and metabolome4,5 reflects and determines regional intestinal physiology and may have implications for disease6. Yet, little is known about the distribution of microorganisms, their environment and their biochemical activity in the gut because of reliance on stool samples and limited access to only some regions of the gut using endoscopy in fasting or sedated individuals7. To address these deficiencies, we developed an ingestible device that collects samples from multiple regions of the human intestinal tract during normal digestion. Collection of 240 intestinal samples from 15 healthy individuals using the device and subsequent multi-omics analyses identified significant differences between bacteria, phages, host proteins and metabolites in the intestines versus stool. Certain microbial taxa were differentially enriched and prophage induction was more prevalent in the intestines than in stool. The host proteome and bile acid profiles varied along the intestines and were highly distinct from those of stool. Correlations between gradients in bile acid concentrations and microbial abundance predicted species that altered the bile acid pool through deconjugation. Furthermore, microbially conjugated bile acid concentrations exhibited amino acid-dependent trends that were not apparent in stool. Overall, non-invasive, longitudinal profiling of microorganisms, proteins and bile acids along the intestinal tract under physiological conditions can help elucidate the roles of the gut microbiome and metabolome in human physiology and disease.

## Interaction between gut microbiota and sex hormones and their relation to sexual dimorphism in metabolic diseases.
 24.02.2023, _JA Santos-Marcos, M Mora-Ortiz, M Tena-Sempere, J Lopez-Miranda, A Camargo_


_Humans, Male, Female, Sex Characteristics, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Gonadal Steroid Hormones, Metabolic Syndrome, Obesity_
Metabolic diseases, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), are now a widespread pandemic in the developed world. These pathologies show sex differences in their development and prevalence, and sex steroids, mainly estrogen and testosterone, are thought to play a prominent role in this sexual dimorphism. The influence of sex hormones on these pathologies is not only reflected in differences between men and women, but also between women themselves, depending on the hormonal changes associated with the menopause. The observed sex differences in gut microbiota composition have led to multiple studies highlighting the interaction between steroid hormones and the gut microbiota and its influence on metabolic diseases, ultimately pointing to a new therapy for these diseases based on the manipulation of the gut microbiota. This review aims to shed light on the role of sexual hormones in sex differences in the development and prevalence of metabolic diseases, focusing on obesity, MetS and T2D. We focus also the interaction between sex hormones and the gut microbiota, and in particular the role of microbiota in aspects such as gut barrier integrity, inflammatory status, and the gut-brain axis, given the relevance of these factors in the development of metabolic diseases.

## Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
 13.05.2023, _W Zhang, X Xu, L Cai, X Cai_


Fecal samples from participants aged 60-80 were collected and sequenced by a high-throughput second-generation sequencer to explore the structural composition of gut microbiota in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). Comparison of gut microbiota between patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and healthy controls, α diversity and β diversity were statistically different. At the genus level, compared with the normal group, the abundance of A Blautia, Fusicatenibacter, Anaerostipes, Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group, CAG-56, Eggerthella, Lachnospiraceae_FCS020_group and Olsenella were decreased significantly in the LC group. In contrast, the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera, Veillonella, Tyzzerella_4, Prevotella_2 and Cronobacter increased significantly. The KEGG and COG pathway analyses showed that the dysbiosis of gut bacteria in primary liver carcinoma is associated with several pathways, including amino acid metabolism, replication and repair, nucleotide metabolism, cell motility, cell growth and death, and transcription. Age is negatively associated with the abundance of Bifidobacterium. Lachnospiraceae_ ND3007_ group, [Eubacterium]_hallii_group, Blautia, Fuscatenibacter and Anaerostipes are negatively correlated with ALT, AST and GGT levels (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is positively associated with the abundance of Erysipelatoclostridium, Magasphaera, Prevotella 2, Escherichia-Shigella, Streptococcus and [Eubacterium]_eligens_group (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. A random forest model showed that the genera Eggerthella, Anaerostipes, and Lachnospiraceae_ ND3007_ group demonstrated the best predictive capacity. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve of Eggerthella, Anaerostipes and Lachnospiraceae_ ND3007_ group are 0.791, 0.766 and 0.730, respectively. These data are derived from the first known gut microbiome study in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Potentially, specific microbiota can be used as a characteristic index for screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of gut microbiota changes in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and even as a therapeutic clinical target.

## Integrated analysis of transcriptome and milk metagenome in subclinical mastitic and healthy cows.
 30.04.2022, _J Zhang, X Liu, T Usman, Y Tang, S Mi, W Li, M Yang, Y Yu_


Abnormally increased somatic cell counts in milk is usually a sign of bovine subclinical mastitis. Mutual interaction between the host and its associated microbiota plays an important role in developing such diseases. The main objective of this study was to explore the difference between cows with elevated somatic cell counts and healthy cattle from the perspective of host-microbe interplay.

## MetaPhlAn 4 profiling of unknown species-level genome bins improves the characterization of diet-associated microbiome changes in mice.
 04.05.2023, _P Manghi, A Blanco-Míguez, S Manara, A NabiNejad, F Cumbo, F Beghini, F Armanini, D Golzato, KD Huang, AM Thomas, G Piccinno, M Punčochář, M Zolfo, TR Lesker, M Bredon, J Planchais, J Glodt, M Valles-Colomer, O Koren, E Pasolli, F Asnicar, T Strowig, H Sokol, N Segata_


Mouse models are key tools for investigating host-microbiome interactions. However, shotgun metagenomics can only profile a limited fraction of the mouse gut microbiome. Here, we employ a metagenomic profiling method, MetaPhlAn 4, which exploits a large catalog of metagenome-assembled genomes (including 22,718 metagenome-assembled genomes from mice) to improve the profiling of the mouse gut microbiome. We combine 622 samples from eight public datasets and an additional cohort of 97 mouse microbiomes, and we assess the potential of MetaPhlAn 4 to better identify diet-related changes in the host microbiome using a meta-analysis approach. We find multiple, strong, and reproducible diet-related microbial biomarkers, largely increasing those identifiable by other available methods relying only on reference information. The strongest drivers of the diet-induced changes are uncharacterized and previously undetected taxa, confirming the importance of adopting metagenomic methods integrating metagenomic assemblies for comprehensive profiling.

## High salt diet aggravates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in glomerular fibrosis in Dahl salt-sensitive rats.
 14.05.2023, _HL Chen, K Peng, DM Zeng, J Yan, YQ Huang, PY Jiang, YF Du, X Ling, J Wu_


Both diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy eventually progress to glomerulosclerosis. Previous studies revealed a potential role of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in the pathophysiology of glomerulosclerosis in diabetic rats. Therefore, we hypothesized that EndMT was also involved in the development of glomerulosclerosis in salt-sensitive hypertension. We aimed to explore the effects of high-salt diet on endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in glomerulosclerosis in Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl-SS) rats.

## ResMiCo: Increasing the quality of metagenome-assembled genomes with deep learning.
 13.05.2023, _O Mineeva, D Danciu, B Schölkopf, RE Ley, G Rätsch, ND Youngblut_


The number of published metagenome assemblies is rapidly growing due to advances in sequencing technologies. However, sequencing errors, variable coverage, repetitive genomic regions, and other factors can produce misassemblies, which are challenging to detect for taxonomically novel genomic data. Assembly errors can affect all downstream analyses of the assemblies. Accuracy for the state of the art in reference-free misassembly prediction does not exceed an AUPRC of 0.57, and it is not clear how well these models generalize to real-world data. Here, we present the Residual neural network for Misassembled Contig identification (ResMiCo), a deep learning approach for reference-free identification of misassembled contigs. To develop ResMiCo, we first generated a training dataset of unprecedented size and complexity that can be used for further benchmarking and developments in the field. Through rigorous validation, we show that ResMiCo is substantially more accurate than the state of the art, and the model is robust to novel taxonomic diversity and varying assembly methods. ResMiCo estimated 7% misassembled contigs per metagenome across multiple real-world datasets. We demonstrate how ResMiCo can be used to optimize metagenome assembly hyperparameters to improve accuracy, instead of optimizing solely for contiguity. The accuracy, robustness, and ease-of-use of ResMiCo make the tool suitable for general quality control of metagenome assemblies and assembly methodology optimization.

## Catch me if you can: capturing microbial community transformation by extracellular DNA using Hi-C sequencing.
 08.05.2023, _D Calderón-Franco, MCM van Loosdrecht, T Abeel, DG Weissbrodt_


The transformation of environmental microorganisms by extracellular DNA is an overlooked mechanism of horizontal gene transfer and evolution. It initiates the acquisition of exogenous genes and propagates antimicrobial resistance alongside vertical and conjugative transfers. We combined mixed-culture biotechnology and Hi-C sequencing to elucidate the transformation of wastewater microorganisms with a synthetic plasmid encoding GFP and kanamycin resistance genes, in the mixed culture of chemostats exposed to kanamycin at concentrations representing wastewater, gut and polluted environments (0.01-2.5-50-100 mg L-1). We found that the phylogenetically distant Gram-negative Runella (102 Hi-C links), Bosea (35), Gemmobacter (33) and Zoogloea (24) spp., and Gram-positive Microbacterium sp. (90) were transformed by the foreign plasmid, under high antibiotic exposure (50 mg L-1). In addition, the antibiotic pressure shifted the origin of aminoglycoside resistance genes from genomic DNA to mobile genetic elements on plasmids accumulating in microorganisms. These results reveal the power of Hi-C sequencing to catch and surveil the transfer of xenogenetic elements inside microbiomes.
