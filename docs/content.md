Antimicrobial autoantigenic glycoprotein 2 (GP2) is an important component of the innate immune system which originates from the exocrine pancreas as well as from the small intestines. The relationship of GP2 with the intestinal microbiome as well as the systemic implications of increased fecal GP2 levels are, however, still unclear. Therefore, fecal samples from 2,812 individuals of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) were collected to determine GP2 levels (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and gut microbiota profiles (16 S rRNA gene sequencing). These data were correlated and associated with highly standardised and comprehensive phenotypic data of the study participants.

Alterations in upper respiratory microbiomes have been implicated in shaping host health trajectories, including by limiting mucosal pathogen colonization. However, limited comparative studies of respiratory microbiome development and functioning across age groups have been performed. Herein, we perform shotgun metagenomic sequencing paired with pathogen inhibition assays to elucidate differences in nasal and oral microbiome composition and intermicrobial interactions across healthy 24-month-old infant (n = 229) and adult (n = 100) populations.

Several perinatal factors influence the intestinal microbiome of newborns during the first days of life, whether during delivery or even in utero. These factors may increase the risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) by causing dysbiosis linked to a NEC-associated microbiota, which may also be associated with other gastrointestinal problems. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential risks associated with microbial shifts in newborns with gastrointestinal symptoms and identify the intestinal microbiota of neonates at risk for NEC.During the study period, 310 preterm and term newborns' first passed meconium occurring within 72 h of birth were collected, and the microbiome was analyzed. We identified the risk factors in the NEC/FI group. Regarding microbiota, we compared the bacterial abundance between the NEC/FI group at the phylum and genus levels and explored the differences in the microbial composition of the 1st stool samples. A total of 14.8% (n = 46) of the infants were diagnosed with NEC or FI. In univariate analysis, the mean gestational age and birth weight were significantly lower in the NEC/FI group (p &lt; 0.001). Prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) &gt; 18 h, chorioamnionitis, and histology were significantly higher in the NEC/FI group (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that gestational age (GA), prolonged membrane rupture (&gt; 18 h), and early onset sepsis were consistently associated with an increased risk of NEC/FI. Infants diagnosed with NEC/FI exhibited a significantly lower abundance of Actinobacteria at the phylum level than the control group (p &lt; 0.001). At the genus level, a significantly lower abundance of Streptococcus and Bifidobacterium which belong to the Actinobacteria phylum, was observed in the NEC/FI group (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the NEC/FI had significantly lower alpha diversities (Shannon Index,3.39 vs. 3.12; P = 0.044, respectively). Our study revealed that newborns with lower diversity and dysbiosis in their initial gut microbiota had an increased risk of developing NEC, with microbiota differences appearing to be associated with NEC/FI. Dysbiosis could potentially serve as a predictive marker for NEC- or GI-related symptoms.

## Resource sharing of an infant gut microbiota synthetic community in combinations of human milk oligosaccharides.

Quickly after birth, the gut microbiota is shaped via species acquisition and resource pressure. Breastmilk, and more specifically, human milk oligosaccharides are a determining factor in the formation of microbial communities and the interactions between bacteria. Prominent human milk oligosaccharide degraders have been rigorously characterized, but it is not known how the gut microbiota is shaped as a complex community. Here, we designed BIG-Syc, a synthetic community of 13 strains from the gut of vaginally born, breastfed infants. BIG-Syc replicated key compositional, metabolic, and proteomic characteristics of the gut microbiota of infants. Upon fermentation of a 4 and 5 human milk oligosaccharide mix, BIG-Syc demonstrated different compositional and proteomic profiles, with Bifidobacterium infantis and Bifidobacterium bifidum suppressing one another. The mix of 5 human milk oligosaccharides resulted in a more diverse composition with dominance of B. bifidum, whereas that with 4 human milk oligosaccharides supported the dominance of B. infantis, in 4 of 6 replicates. Reintroduction of bifidobacteria to BIG-Syc led to their engraftment and establishment of their niche. Based on proteomics and genome-scale metabolic models, we reconstructed the carbon source utilization and metabolite and gas production per strain. BIG-Syc demonstrated teamwork as cross-feeders utilized simpler carbohydrates, organic acids, and gases released from human milk oligosaccharide degraders. Collectively, our results showed that human milk oligosaccharides prompt resource-sharing for their complete degradation while leading to a different compositional and functional profile in the community. At the same time, BIG-Syc proved to be an accurate model for the representation of intra-microbe interactions.

## Multi-omics analysis reveals the interplay between pulmonary microbiome and host in immunocompromised patients with sepsis-induced acute lung injury.
 18.10.2024, _F Lu, T Huang, R Chen, H Yin_


The mechanisms behind the high inflammatory state and immunocompromise in severe sepsis remain unclear. While microbiota's role in immune regulation is known, the impact of pulmonary microbiota on sepsis progression is not fully understood. This study aims to investigate pulmonary microbial characteristics in septic patients and their relationship with host immune-related genes and clinical features. Fifty-four sepsis patients were divided into the immunocompromised host (ICH) group (n = 18) and the control group (n = 36). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed using metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to assess the pulmonary microbiome, and transcriptomic sequencing evaluated host gene expression. The pulmonary microbiota network in the ICH group showed notable alterations. Symbiotic bacteria like Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus oralis were key taxa in the control group. In contrast, opportunistic pathogens such as Campylobacter concisus and Prevotella melaninogenica, typically linked to infections in various body sites, dominated in the ICH group. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differential genes between the two groups. The downregulated differential genes in the ICH group were primarily enriched in pathways related to T-cell activation and the Type I interferon signaling pathway, both crucial for the immune system. Further correlation analysis identified significant associations between certain microbes and host genes, as well as clinical indicators, particularly with species like Campylobacter concisus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, and several species of Veillonella. These findings suggest that alterations in the pulmonary microbiome, especially the presence of opportunistic pathogens, may contribute to immune dysregulation in immunocompromised septic patients, warranting further research to explore causal relationships.

HIV-1 infection is characterized by a massive depletion of mucosal CD4 T cells that triggers a cascade of events ultimately linking gut microbial dysbiosis to HIV-1 disease progression and pathogenesis. The association between HIV infection and the enteric virome composition is less characterized, although viruses are an essential component of the gut ecosystem. Here, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the fecal viral (eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages) and bacterial microbiome in people with HIV (PWH) and in HIV-negative individuals. To gain further insight into the association between the gut microbiome composition, HIV-associated immunodeficiency, and immune recovery, we carried out a longitudinal study including 14 PWH who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) and were followed for 24 months with samplings performed at baseline (before ART) and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months post-ART initiation.

## Gut microbiota determines the fate of dietary fiber-targeted interventions in host health.

Epidemiological investigation confirmed that the intake of dietary fiber (DF) is closely related to human health, and the most important factor affecting the physiological function of DF, besides its physicochemical properties, is the gut microbiota. This paper mainly summarizes the interaction between DF and gut microbiota, including the influence of DF on the colonization of gut microbiota based on its different physicochemical properties, and the physiological role of gut microbiota in destroying the complex molecular structure of DF by encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes, thus producing small molecular products that affect the metabolism of the host. Taking cardiovascular disease (Atherosclerosis and hypertension), liver disease, and immune diseases as examples, it is confirmed that some DF, such as fructo-oligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, xylo-oligosaccharide, and inulin, have prebiotic-like physiological effects. These effects are dependent on the metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. Therefore, this paper further explores how DF affects the gut microbiota's production of substances such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites, and provides a preliminary explanation of the mechanisms associated with their impact on host health. Finally, based on the structural properties of DF and the large heterogeneity in the composition of the population gut microbiota, it may be a future trend to utilize DF and the gut microbiota to correlate host health for precision nutrition by combining the information from population disease databases.

## Vaginal lactobacilli produce anti-inflammatory β-carboline compounds.
 18.10.2024, _VJ Glick, CA Webber, LE Simmons, MC Martin, M Ahmad, CH Kim, AND Adams, S Bang, MC Chao, NC Howard, SM Fortune, M Verma, M Jost, LK Beura, MJ James, SY Lee, CM Mitchell, J Clardy, KH Kim, S Gopinath_


The optimal vaginal microbiome is a Lactobacillus-dominant community. Apart from Lactobacillus iners, the presence of Lactobacillus species is associated with reduced vaginal inflammation and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Loss of Lactobacillus-dominance is associated with inflammatory conditions, such as bacterial vaginosis (BV). We have identified that Lactobacillus crispatus, a key vaginal bacterial species, produces a family of β-carboline compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. These compounds suppress nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and interferon (IFN) signaling downstream of multiple pattern recognition receptors in primary human cells and significantly dampen type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) activation in monocytes. Topical application of an anti-inflammatory β-carboline compound, perlolyrine, was sufficient to significantly reduce vaginal inflammation in a mouse model of genital herpes infection. These compounds are enriched in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) of healthy people compared with people with BV. This study identifies a family of compounds by which vaginal lactobacilli mediate host immune homeostasis and highlights a potential therapeutic avenue for vaginal inflammation.

Coronary artery disease (CAD), a critical condition resulting from systemic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and gut microbiota dysbiosis, poses a global public health challenge. ALW-II-41-27, a specific inhibitor of the EphA2 receptor, has shown anti-inflammatory prosperities. However, the impact of ALW-II-41-27 on atherosclerosis has not been elucidated. This study aimed to examine the roles of pharmacologically inhibiting EphA2 and the underlying mechanism in ameliorating atherosclerosis. ALW-II-41-27 was administered to apoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet via intraperitoneal injection. We first discovered that ALW-II-41-27 led to a significant reduction in atherosclerotic plaques, evidenced by reduced lipid and macrophage accumulation, alongside an increase in collagen and smooth muscle cell content. ALW-II-41-27 also significantly lowered plasma and hepatic cholesterol levels, as well as the colonic inflammation. Furthermore, gut microbiota was analyzed by metagenomics and plasma metabolites by untargeted metabolomics. ALW-II-41-27-treated mice enriched Enterococcus, Akkermansia, Eggerthella and Lactobaccilus, accompanied by enhanced secondary bile acids production. To explore the causal link between ALW-II-41-27-associated gut microbiota and atherosclerosis, fecal microbiota transplantation was employed. Mice that received ALW-II-41-27-treated mouse feces exhibited the attenuated atherosclerotic plaque. In clinical, lower plasma DCA and HDCA levels were determined in CAD patients using quantitative metabolomics and exhibited a negative correlation with higher monocytes EphA2 expression. Our findings underscore the potential of ALW-II-41-27 as a novel therapeutic agent for atherosclerosis, highlighting its capacity to modulate gut microbiota composition and bile acid metabolism, thereby offering a promising avenue for CAD.
