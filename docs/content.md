## Kidney outcomes and prognostic factors of myeloma associated acute kidney injury in the contemporary era.
 17.06.2023, _C Ratnayake, SDJ Gibbs, D Lee_


Myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN) has historically been associated with poor kidney outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the kidney outcomes and identify prognostic factors of myeloma-associated acute kidney injury (M-AKI) in the contemporary era of anti-plasma cell therapy. Patients who received anti-myeloma therapy with M-AKI (January 2012 to June 2020) from a single centre were identified from electronic medical records. Diagnosis of MCN was either biopsy confirmed (BC) or clinically suspected (CS), the latter defined as acute kidney injury with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and involved serum free light chains (iSFLC) &gt;500 mg/L at diagnosis. Twenty-six patients with M-AKI were identified (BC: n = 13, CS: n = 13). Median eGFR at diagnosis was 12 (interquartile range 6-20) mL/min/1.73 m2 . All six dialysis-requiring patients achieved dialysis independence after 71 (43-208) days. The best-achieved eGFR was 47 (32-67) mL/min/1.73 m2 after 120 (63-167) days post-treatment, which was maintained at 47 (33-66) mL/min/1.73 m2 12 months post-treatment. Patients with best-achieved eGFR above the median were more likely to have achieved an iSFLC of &lt;20 mg/L (above median group 62% versus below median group 0%; p &lt; .001) and lower best post-treatment iSFLC (20 (12-90) versus 67 (29-146) mg/L; p &lt; .05). Best-achieved iSFLC was a prognostic factor for superior eGFR following treatment for M-AKI. Despite low eGFR at diagnosis, contemporary anti-myeloma therapy can achieve significant recovery of kidney function.

_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Retrospective chart review of patient socioeconomic status and language preference associated with live video telehealth in a pediatric dermatology practice.
 17.06.2023, _NC Zacher, KL Pickett, SJ Schmiege, CA Olson, AL Bruckner, LL Kohn_


Pediatric teledermatology rapidly expanded with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impacts of this expansion on patients' access to care have not yet been entirely defined. In this retrospective study of 3027 patients in an academic pediatric dermatology practice, patients who identified as having a primary language other than English were less likely to access pediatric dermatology care during the COVID lockdown. This study did not identify a significant or meaningful difference in age, geography, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, or race between patients who were offered pediatric dermatology care that was either in-person or via synchronous telehealth. These findings are overall reassuring that there were not major disparities in telehealth utilization during the COVID shelter-in-place mandate, although highlight the need for institutions to ensure systems are in place to enhance telehealth access for patients with non-English primary language.

## Determination of Tr1 cell populations correlating with distinct activation states in acute IAV infection.
 15.06.2023, _CA Abbott, EL Freimayer, TS Tyllis, TS Norton, M Alsharifi, A H S Heng, SM Pederson, Z Qu, M Armstrong, GR Hill, SR McColl, I Comerford_


Type I regulatory (Tr1) cells are defined as FOXP3-IL-10-secreting CD4+ T cells that contribute to immune suppression and typically express the markers LAG-3 and CD49b and other co-inhibitory receptors. These cells have not been studied in detail the context of the resolution of acute infection in the lung. Here, we identify FOXP3-IL-10+ CD4+ T cells transiently accumulating in the lung parenchyma during resolution of the response to sublethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice. These cells were dependent on IL-27Rα, which was required for timely recovery from IAV-induced weight loss. LAG-3 and CD49b were not generally co-expressed by FOXP3- IL-10+ CD4+ T cells in this model and four populations of these cells based on LAG-3 and CD49b co-expression were apparent (LAG-3-CD49b- [DN], LAG-3+CD49b+ [DP], LAG-3+CD49b- [LAG-3+], LAG-3-CD49b+ [CD49b+]). However, each population exhibited suppressive potential consistent with the definition of Tr1 cells. Notably, differences between these populations of Tr1 cells were apparent including differential dependence on IL-10 to mediate suppression and expression of markers indicative of different activation states and terminal differentiation. Sort-transfer experiments indicated that LAG-3+ Tr1 cells exhibited the capacity to convert to DN and DP Tr1 cells, indicative of plasticity between these populations. Together, these data determine the features and suppressive potential of Tr1 cells in the resolution of IAV infection and identify four populations delineated by LAG-3 and CD49b, which likely correspond to different Tr1 cell activation states.

## Obesity: Policy and Practice Recommendations for High-Risk Populations Influenced by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
 22.12.2022, _KN Robinson, DA Saber_


_Humans, United States, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Pandemics, Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype, Obesity, Policy_
Obesity has been linked to higher morbidity and mortality in those that contract novel viruses, such as H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. Loss of life and the high cost of obesity highlight the need to focus on preventative measures. The state of Maine (United States) is profiled as a rural state with high rates of obesity and low health literacy that benefits from programs to improve health. However, more multidirectional efforts are needed. Four recommendations for building a healthier, more resilient patient population are discussed here: (i) state incentives and subsidies, (ii) employers to incentivize healthy living, (iii) federal incentives and initiatives, and (iv) personal responsibility for health and wellness.

## Gut microbiota and cognitive development in infant mice: Quantity and source of potable water.
 16.06.2023, _CS Kim, DM Shin_


_Animals, Mice, Drinking Water, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Dehydration, Cognition, Cognitive Dysfunction, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes_
Not only the water quantity consumed but also the source of drinking water has been considered for their health benefits, but there is limited evidence. We aimed to determine whether the amount and type of drinking water affect physiological and biological functions, including brain function, by confirming how it affects gut microbiota which has an important regulatory role in host physiology. Three-week-old infant mice were subjected to 1) a water restriction experiment (control group, ad libitum consumption of distilled water; dehydration group, time-limited access to distilled water [15 min/day]) and 2) different water source experiment (distilled water, purified water, spring water, and tap water groups). The gut microbiota and cognitive development were analyzed using the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing method and the Barnes maze, respectively. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) changed depending on age (juveniles vs. infants). Insufficient water intake reversed these developmental changes, showing that the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the F/B ratio in dehydrated juvenile mice were similar to those in normal infant mice. Additionally, clustering analysis revealed no significant differences in the intestinal flora in the mice from the different drinking water sources; however, dehydration significantly altered the composition of the genera compared to the other water source groups wherein water was provided ad libitum. Moreover, cognitive development was significantly disrupted by insufficient water intake, although the type of drinking water had no significant influence. Cognitive decline, measured by relative latency, was positively associated with the relative abundance of unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae that were in significantly high relative abundance in the dehydration group. These results suggest that the water quantity consumed, rather than the mineral content of drinking water, is imperative for shaping the early gut microbiota associated with cognitive development during infancy.

## Globally consistent response of plant microbiome diversity across hosts and continents to soil nutrients and herbivores.

_Herbivory, Biomass, Microbiota, Nutrients, Soil_
All multicellular organisms host a diverse microbiome composed of microbial pathogens, mutualists, and commensals, and changes in microbiome diversity or composition can alter host fitness and function. Nonetheless, we lack a general understanding of the drivers of microbiome diversity, in part because it is regulated by concurrent processes spanning scales from global to local. Global-scale environmental gradients can determine variation in microbiome diversity among sites, however an individual host's microbiome also may reflect its local micro-environment. We fill this knowledge gap by experimentally manipulating two potential mediators of plant microbiome diversity (soil nutrient supply and herbivore density) at 23 grassland sites spanning global-scale gradients in soil nutrients, climate, and plant biomass. Here we show that leaf-scale microbiome diversity in unmanipulated plots depended on the total microbiome diversity at each site, which was highest at sites with high soil nutrients and plant biomass. We also found that experimentally adding soil nutrients and excluding herbivores produced concordant results across sites, increasing microbiome diversity by increasing plant biomass, which created a shaded microclimate. This demonstration of consistent responses of microbiome diversity across a wide range of host species and environmental conditions suggests the possibility of a general, predictive understanding of microbiome diversity.

## Benchmark Models for Elucidating Ligand Effects: Thiols Ligated Isostructural Cu6 Nanoclusters.
 17.06.2023, _L Zhang, M Guo, J Zhou, C Fang, X Sun_


Atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) have attracted tremendous attention for their huge potential in many applications. However, the uncertainty of the growth mechanism and complexity of the crystallization process hinder the in-depth understanding of their properties. In particular, the ligand effect has been rarely explored at the atomic/molecular level due to the lack of feasible models. Herein, three isostructural Cu6 NCs ligated with diverse mono-thiol ligands (2-mercaptobenzimidazole, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, and 2-mercaptobenzoxazole, respectively) are successfully synthesized, which provide an ideal platform to unambiguously address the intrinsic role of ligands. The overall atom-by-atom structural evolution process of Cu6 NCs is mapped out with delicate mass spectrometry (MS) for the first time. It is intriguingly found that the ligands, albeit only atomic difference (NH, O, and S), can profoundly affect the building-up processes, chemical properties, atomic structures, as well as catalytic activities of Cu NCs. Furthermore, ion-molecule reactions combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the defective sites formed on ligand can significantly contribute to the activation of molecular oxygen. This study provides fundamental insights into the ligand effect, which is vital for the delicate design of high-efficient Cu NCs-based catalysts.

## Rookery through rehabilitation: Microbial community assembly in newborn harbour seals after maternal separation.
 17.06.2023, _AD Switzer, BJ Callahan, EK Costello, EM Bik, C Fontaine, FMD Gulland, DA Relman_


Microbial community assembly remains largely unexplored in marine mammals, despite its potential importance for conservation and management. Here, neonatal microbiota assembly was studied in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) at a rehabilitation facility soon after maternal separation, through weaning, to the time of release back to their native environment. We found that the gingival and rectal communities of rehabilitated harbour seals were distinct from the microbiotas of formula and pool water, and became increasingly diverse and dissimilar over time, ultimately resembling the gingival and rectal communities of local wild harbour seals. Harbour seal microbiota assembly was compared to that of human infants, revealing the rapid emergence of host specificity and evidence of phylosymbiosis even though these harbour seals had been raised by humans. Early life prophylactic antibiotics were associated with changes in the composition of the harbour seal gingival and rectal communities and surprisingly, with transient increases in alpha diversity, perhaps because of microbiota sharing during close cohabitation with other harbour seals. Antibiotic-associated effects dissipated over time. These results suggest that while early life maternal contact may provide seeding for microbial assembly, co-housing of conspecifics during rehabilitation may help neonatal mammals achieve a healthy host-specific microbiota with features of resilience.

## Design, synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular docking studies of quercetin-linker-H2S donor conjugates for the treatment of diabetes and wound healing.
 17.06.2023, _S He, J Liu, L Hu, Y Zhan, H Tong, H Zhu, H Guo, H Sun, M Liu_


Based on the use of quercetin for treating diabetes and H2S for promoting wound healing, a series of three quercetin-linker-H2S donor conjugates was designed, synthesized and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS. Meanwhile, in vitro evaluation of these compounds was also researched by IR-HepG2 treatment experiment, MTT assay, scratch test and tubule formation experiment. The three compounds could be used to treat insulin resistance induced by high glucose and promote the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, wound healing, and the formation of tubules in vitro under a high-glucose environment. Our results illustrate that these compounds could be used to treat diabetes and promote wound healing at the same time. Furthermore, molecular docking study results of the compounds were consistent with the evaluated biological activity. In vivo research of compounds is underway.
