Predation structures food webs, influences energy flow, and alters rates and pathways of nutrient cycling through ecosystems, effects that are well documented for macroscopic predators. In the microbial world, predatory bacteria are common, yet little is known about their rates of growth and roles in energy flows through microbial food webs, in part because these are difficult to quantify. Here, we show that growth and carbon uptake were higher in predatory bacteria compared to nonpredatory bacteria, a finding across 15 sites, synthesizing 82 experiments and over 100,000 taxon-specific measurements of element flow into newly synthesized bacterial DNA. Obligate predatory bacteria grew 36% faster and assimilated carbon at rates 211% higher than nonpredatory bacteria. These differences were less pronounced for facultative predators (6% higher growth rates, 17% higher carbon assimilation rates), though high growth and carbon assimilation rates were observed for some facultative predators, such as members of the genera Lysobacter and Cytophaga, both capable of gliding motility and wolf-pack hunting behavior. Added carbon substrates disproportionately stimulated growth of obligate predators, with responses 63% higher than those of nonpredators for the Bdellovibrionales and 81% higher for the Vampirovibrionales, whereas responses of facultative predators to substrate addition were no different from those of nonpredators. This finding supports the ecological theory that higher productivity increases predator control of lower trophic levels. These findings also indicate that the functional significance of bacterial predators increases with energy flow and that predatory bacteria influence element flow through microbial food webs.IMPORTANCE The word "predator" may conjure images of leopards killing and eating impala on the African savannah or of great white sharks attacking elephant seals off the coast of California. But microorganisms are also predators, including bacteria that kill and eat other bacteria. While predatory bacteria have been found in many environments, it has been challenging to document their importance in nature. This study quantified the growth of predatory and nonpredatory bacteria in soils (and one stream) by tracking isotopically labeled substrates into newly synthesized DNA. Predatory bacteria were more active than nonpredators, and obligate predators, such as Bdellovibrionales and Vampirovibrionales, increased in growth rate in response to added substrates at the base of the food chain, strong evidence of trophic control. This work provides quantitative measures of predator activity and suggests that predatory bacteria-along with protists, nematodes, and phages-are active and important in microbial food webs.

## Anaerobic Microbial Metabolism of Dichloroacetate.
 28.04.2021, _G Chen, N Jiang, MI Villalobos Solis, F Kara Murdoch, RW Murdoch, Y Xie, CM Swift, RL Hettich, FE Löffler_


Dichloroacetate (DCA) commonly occurs in the environment due to natural production and anthropogenic releases, but its fate under anoxic conditions is uncertain. Mixed culture RM comprising "Candidatus Dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis" strain RM utilizes DCA as an energy source, and the transient formation of formate, H2, and carbon monoxide (CO) was observed during growth. Only about half of the DCA was recovered as acetate, suggesting a fermentative catabolic route rather than a reductive dechlorination pathway. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and 16S rRNA gene-targeted quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) implicated "Candidatus Dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis" strain RM in DCA degradation. An (S)-2-haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) encoded on the genome of strain RM was heterologously expressed, and the purified HAD demonstrated the cofactor-independent stoichiometric conversion of DCA to glyoxylate at a rate of 90 ± 4.6 nkat mg-1 protein. Differential protein expression analysis identified enzymes catalyzing the conversion of DCA to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) via glyoxylate as well as enzymes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Glyoxylate carboligase, which catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of glyoxylate to form tartronate semialdehyde, was highly abundant in DCA-grown cells. The physiological, biochemical, and proteogenomic data demonstrate the involvement of an HAD and the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in the anaerobic fermentation of DCA, which has implications for DCA turnover in natural and engineered environments, as well as the metabolism of the cancer drug DCA by gut microbiota.IMPORTANCE Dichloroacetate (DCA) is ubiquitous in the environment due to natural formation via biological and abiotic chlorination processes and the turnover of chlorinated organic materials (e.g., humic substances). Additional sources include DCA usage as a chemical feedstock and cancer drug and its unintentional formation during drinking water disinfection by chlorination. Despite the ubiquitous presence of DCA, its fate under anoxic conditions has remained obscure. We discovered an anaerobic bacterium capable of metabolizing DCA, identified the enzyme responsible for DCA dehalogenation, and elucidated a novel DCA fermentation pathway. The findings have implications for the turnover of DCA and the carbon and electron flow in electron acceptor-depleted environments and the human gastrointestinal tract.

## [Fecal microbiome change in patients with ulcerative colitis after fecal microbiota transplantation].
 04.03.2021, _АЮ Тикунов, ВВ Морозов, АН Швалов, АВ Бардашева, ЕВ Шрайнер, ОА Максимова, ИО Волошина, ВВ Морозова, ВВ Власов, НВ Тикунова_


Intestinal human microbiota is a dynamic system that is under the pressures of its host organism and external factors. Microbiota disruption caused by these factors can lead to severe diseases including inflammatory and oncological diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. One of the possible approaches in managing the intestinal microbiota is fecal microbiota transplantation (FT) - transfer of the microbiota from the stool of a healthy donor to the intestinal tract of a recipient patient. Currently, this procedure is recognized as an efficacious method to normalize the intestinal microbiota mainly in inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. In Russia, pilot studies of the effectiveness of FT in patients with ulcerative colitis have been conducted for several years, and these studies were started in Novosibirsk. The aim of this study was to assess the change of intestinal microbiome in 20 patients with ulcerative colitis after a single FT procedure. The main method is a comparative analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequence libraries constructed using fecal samples obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis before and after FT and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. The obtained results showed that FT led to an increase in average biodiversity in samples after FT compared to samples before FT; however, the difference was not significant. In the samples studied, the proportion of Firmicutes sequences, the major gastrointestinal microbiota of healthy people, was decreased (~32 % vs. &gt;70 %), while the proportion of Proteobacteria sequences was increased (&gt;9 % vs. &lt;5 %). In some samples collected before FT, sequences of pathogenic Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were detected, including Acinetobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophylia, Streptococcus spp. In most cases, the proportion of such sequences after FT substantially decreased in appropriate samples. The exception was the Clostridium difficile sequences, which accounted for &lt;0.5 % of the sequences in samples from almost half of the patients and after FT, the share of such C. difficile sequences was significantly reduced only in samples from three patients. It should be noted that the proportion of Lactobacillus spp. increased ten-fold and their species composition significantly expanded. According to the obtained results, a preliminary conclusion can be made that even a single FT procedure can lead to an increase in the biodiversity of the gastrointestinal microbiota in patients and to the optimization of the taxonomic composition of the microbiota.

## Evaluation of the Effect of Storage Methods on Fecal, Saliva, and Skin Microbiome Composition.
 28.04.2021, _C Marotz, KJ Cavagnero, SJ Song, D McDonald, S Wandro, G Humphrey, M Bryant, G Ackermann, E Diaz, R Knight_


As the number of human microbiome studies expand, it is increasingly important to identify cost-effective, practical preservatives that allow for room temperature sample storage. Here, we reanalyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from a large sample storage study published in 2016 and performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on remnant DNA from this experiment. Both results support the initial findings that 95% ethanol, a nontoxic, cost-effective preservative, is effective at preserving samples at room temperature for weeks. We expanded on this analysis by collecting a new set of fecal, saliva, and skin samples to determine the optimal ratio of 95% ethanol to sample. We identified optimal collection protocols for fecal samples (storing a fecal swab in 95% ethanol) and saliva samples (storing unstimulated saliva in 95% ethanol at a ratio of 1:2). Storing skin swabs in 95% ethanol reduced microbial biomass and disrupted community composition, highlighting the difficulties of low biomass sample preservation. The results from this study identify practical solutions for large-scale analyses of fecal and oral microbial communities.IMPORTANCE Expanding our knowledge of microbial communities across diverse environments includes collecting samples in places far from the laboratory. Identifying cost-effective preservatives that will enable room temperature storage of microbial communities for sequencing analysis is crucial to enabling microbiome analyses across diverse populations. Here, we validate findings that 95% ethanol efficiently preserves microbial composition at room temperature for weeks. We also identified the optimal ratio of 95% ethanol to sample for stool and saliva to preserve both microbial load and composition. These results provide rationale for an accessible, nontoxic, cost-effective solution that will enable crowdsourcing microbiome studies, such as The Microsetta Initiative, and lower the barrier for collecting diverse samples.

## Diet-Microbiota-Brain Axis in Alzheimer's Disease.
 27.04.2021, _HJ Kincaid, R Nagpal, H Yadav_


Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, particularly in older adults, with clinical manifestations of progressive cognitive decline and functional impairment. The prevalence of AD and related dementia is mounting worldwide, but its etiology remains unresolved, with no available preventative or ameliorative therapy. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota of patients with AD is different from cognitively normal counterparts.

## The significance of the gut microbiome in children with functional constipation.
 28.04.2021, _M Kwiatkowska, A Krogulska_


Constipation is a widespread problem in pediatric practice, affecting almost 30% of pediatric population. As much as 90-95% of constipation cases have a functional basis, and although the pathogenesis of functional constipation remains unclear, its etiology is considered to be multifactorial. Its growing prevalence has been attributed to the occurrence of disorders in the homeostasis of gastrointestinal microbiota. In humans, the best known microbiome is that of the intestines, which has been the subject of a number of studies based on recognition of the 16S rRNA gene sequence. Microbiota are believed to influence the pathogenesis of functional constipation by affecting peristalsis, relationship with diet, and physical activity. The paper evaluates the role of intestinal microbiota in functional constipation and describes its contribution to the onset of disease. Determining the importance of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of functional constipation creates hope for the development of new prevention and treatment methods.

This paper aims to describe the biochemical interactions between teeth and the oral environment that occur during the caries process, hence it covers all the steps related to physico-chemical reactions, including the most up-to-date theoretical basis in the clinical application for the prevention and treatment of caries. The terms 'demineralization' and 'remineralization' that characterise this process were analysed, as well as the role of the microbiota in its interaction with the hard surface of the teeth. The biochemical mechanisms that lead to the onset of carious lesions and those that occur during the healing and repair of such lesions are listed.

## Longitudinal Profiling of the Macaque Vaginal Microbiome Reveals Similarities to Diverse Human Vaginal Communities.
 28.04.2021, _NS Rhoades, SM Hendrickson, DR Gerken, K Martinez, OD Slayden, MK Slifka, I Messaoudi_


The vaginal microbiota plays an important role in women's reproductive and urogenital health. It is now well accepted that a "healthy" vaginal microbiome is dominated by Lactobacillus species. Disturbances in this microbial community can lead to several adverse outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease and bacterial vaginosis (BV), as well as increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, miscarriage, and preterm births. However, vaginal communities, especially those of women in the developing world, can be comprised of a diverse set of microorganisms in the absence of overt clinical symptoms. The implications of these diverse vaginal microbiomes for women's health remain poorly understood. Rhesus macaques are an excellent translational animal model to address these questions due to significant physiological and genetic homology with humans. In this study, we performed a longitudinal analysis of clinical and microbiome data from 16 reproductive-age female rhesus macaques. At both the taxonomic and functional levels, the rhesus macaque vaginal microbiome was most similar to that of women who harbor a diverse vaginal community associated with asymptomatic/symptomatic bacterial vaginosis. Specifically, rhesus macaque vaginal microbiomes harbored a diverse set of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, including Sneathia, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Mobiluncus Interestingly, some animals were transiently colonized by Lactobacillus and some with Gardnerella Our in-depth and comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of the model to understand the health implications of a diverse vaginal microbiome and test interventions for manipulating this community.IMPORTANCE It is widely accepted that the "healthy" vaginal microbiome of women in the developed world is dominated by Lactobacillus species. However, in the developing world, many asymptomatic women harbor diverse vaginal microbial communities that are typically associated with bacterial vaginosis. Many questions remain about the drivers and health implications of a diverse vaginal microbial community. Rhesus macaques provide an excellent translational model to address these questions due to significant physiological and genetic homology with humans. In this study, we performed a longitudinal analysis of clinical and microbiome data from a large cohort of reproductive-age rhesus macaques. At the taxonomic, genomic, and functional levels, the rhesus macaque vaginal microbiome was most similar to that of humans, who harbor a diverse vaginal community associated with asymptomatic/symptomatic bacterial vaginosis. Our in-depth and comprehensive analysis highlights the utility of macaques as a model to study diverse vaginal community state types and test interventions for manipulating the vaginal microbiome.

## Association of Vaginal Microbiota with Signs and Symptoms of the Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause across Reproductive Stages.
 27.04.2021, _M Shardell, PE Gravitt, AE Burke, J Ravel, RM Brotman_


The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) describes signs and symptoms resulting from effects of estrogen deficiency on the female genitourinary tract, including the vagina, labia, urethra, and bladder. Signs/symptoms associated with GSM may occur during any reproductive stage from multiple etiologies but are most common during menopause due to low estrogen. Vaginal microbiota, particularly Lactobacillus spp., are beneficial to the female genital tract; however, their abundance declines during menopause. We aimed to longitudinally assess vaginal microbiota characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and GSM-associated endpoints across reproductive stages. In a two-year cohort study of 750 women aged 35-60 years at enrollment and 2,111 semiannual person-visits, low-Lactobacillus vaginal microbiota communities were observed at 21.2% (169/798), 22.9% (137/597), and 49.7% (356/716) of person-visits among pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal women, respectively (p&lt;.001). Compared to communities that have high Gardnerella vaginalis relative abundance and diverse anaerobes, the following communities were associated with a lower covariate-adjusted odds of vaginal atrophy: L. crispatus-dominated communities among postmenopausal women (odds ratio[OR]=0.25; 95% confidence interval[CI], 0.08, 0.81), L. gasseri/L. jensenii (OR=0.21; 95%CI, 0.05, 0.94) and L. iners (OR=0.21; 95%CI, 0.05, 0.85) among perimenopausal women, and L. iners-dominated communities (OR=0.18; 95%CI, 0.04, 0.76) among premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women with L. gasseri/L. jensenii-dominated communities had the lowest odds of vaginal dryness (OR=0.36; 95%CI, 0.12, 1.06) and low libido (OR=0.28; 95%CI, 0.10, 0.74). Findings for urinary incontinence were inconsistent. Associations of vaginal microbiota with GSM signs/symptoms are most evident after menopause, suggesting an avenue for treatment and prevention.

## Targeted Delivery of Probiotics: Perspectives on Research and Commercialization.
 29.04.2021, _KS Yoha, S Nida, S Dutta, JA Moses, C Anandharamakrishnan_


Considering the significance of the gut microbiota on human health, there has been ever-growing research and commercial interest in various aspects of probiotic functional foods and drugs. A probiotic food requires cautious consideration in terms of strain selection, appropriate process and storage conditions, cell viability and functionality, and effective delivery at the targeted site. To address these challenges, several technologies have been explored and some of them have been adopted for industrial applicability. Encapsulation of probiotics has been recognized as an effective way to stabilize them in their dried form. By conferring a physical barrier to protect them from adverse conditions, the encapsulation approach renders direct benefits on stability, delivery, and functionality. Various techniques have been explored to encapsulate probiotics, but it is noteworthy that the encapsulation method itself influences surface morphology, viability, and survivability of probiotics. This review focuses on the need to encapsulate probiotics, trends in various encapsulation techniques, current research and challenges in targeted delivery, the market status of encapsulated probiotics, and future directions. Specific focus has been given on various in vitro methods that have been explored to better understand their delivery and performance.

## A Single Microbiome Gene Alters Murine Susceptibility to Acute Arsenic Exposure.
 29.04.2021, _Q Wang, TR McDermott, ST Walk_


Environmental toxicant exposure contributes to morbidity and mortality of many human diseases. With respect to arsenic, microbially driven chemical transformations dictate its toxicity and mobility in virtually every environment yet studied, so a general hypothesis is that the human gut microbiome determines disease outcome following exposure. However, the complex nature of the gut microbiome and the myriad of potential interactions with human cells/tissues make it challenging to quantify the influence of specific arsenic-active functions-a requisite step in developing effective disease prevention and/or clinical intervention strategies. To control both mammalian and microbial function during toxicant exposure, we genetically defined the gut microbiome of mice using only Escherichia coli strain, AW3110 (▵arsRBC), or the same strain carrying a single genome copy of the Fucus vesiculosus metallothionein gene (AW3110::fmt); a cysteine-rich peptide that complexes with arsenite, facilitating bioaccumulation and reducing its toxic effects. AW3110::fmt bioaccumulated significantly more arsenic and gnotobiotic mice colonized by this strain excreted significantly more arsenic in stool and accumulated significantly less arsenic in organs. Moreover, AW3110::fmt gnotobiotic mice were protected from acute toxicity exposure (20 ppm AsIII) relative to controls. This study demonstrates-in a highly controlled fashion-that a single microbiome function (arsenic bioaccumulation) encoded by a single gene in a single human gut microbiome bacterium significantly alters mammalian host arsenic exposure. The experimental model described herein allows for a highly controlled and directed assessment of microbiome functions, and is useful to quantify the influence of specific microbiome-arsenic interactions that help mitigate human disease.

## Manure-Based Amendments Influence Surface-Associated Bacteria and Markers of Antibiotic Resistance on Radishes Grown in Soils with Different Textures.
 28.04.2021, _GKP Guron, C Chen, P Du, A Pruden, MA Ponder_


A controlled greenhouse study was performed to determine the effect of manure or compost amendments, derived during or in the absence of antibiotic treatment of beef and dairy cattle, on radish taproot-associated microbiota and indicators of antibiotic resistance when grown in different soil textures. Bacterial beta diversity, determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, bifurcated according to soil texture (P &lt; 0.001, R = 0.501). There was a striking cross-effect in which raw manure from antibiotic-treated and antibiotic-free beef and dairy cattle added to loamy sand (LS) elevated relative (16S rRNA gene-normalized) (by 0.9 to 1.9 log10) and absolute (per-radish) (by 1.1 to 3.0 log10) abundances of intI1 (an integrase gene and indicator of mobile multiantibiotic resistance) on radishes at harvest compared to chemical fertilizer-only control conditions (P &lt; 0.001). Radishes tended to carry fewer copies of intI1 and sul1 when grown in silty clay loam than LS. Composting reduced relative abundance of intI1 on LS-grown radishes (0.6 to 2.4 log10 decrease versus corresponding raw manure; P &lt; 0.001). Effects of antibiotic use were rarely discernible. Heterotrophic plate count bacteria capable of growth on media containing tetracycline, vancomycin, sulfamethazine, or erythromycin tended to increase on radishes grown in turned composted antibiotic-treated dairy or beef control (no antibiotics) manures relative to the corresponding raw manure in LS (0.8- to 2.3-log10 increase; P &lt; 0.001), suggesting that composting sometimes enriches cultivable bacteria with phenotypic resistance. This study demonstrates that combined effects of soil texture and manure-based amendments influence the microbiota of radish surfaces and markers of antibiotic resistance, illuminating future research directions for reducing agricultural sources of antibiotic resistance.IMPORTANCE In working toward a comprehensive strategy to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance, potential farm-to-fork routes of dissemination are gaining attention. The effects of preharvest factors on the microbiota and corresponding antibiotic resistance indicators on the surfaces of produce commonly eaten raw is of special interest. Here, we conducted a controlled greenhouse study, using radishes as a root vegetable grown in direct contact with soil, and compared the effects of manure-based soil amendments, antibiotic use in the cattle from which the manure was sourced, composting of the manure, and soil texture, with chemical fertilizer only as a control. We noted significant effects of amendment type and soil texture on the composition of the microbiota and genes used as indicators of antibiotic resistance on radish surfaces. The findings take a step toward identifying agricultural practices that aid in reducing carriage of antibiotic resistance and corresponding risks to consumers.

## Human- and Infrastructure-associated Bacteria in Greywater.
 27.04.2021, _M Nagarkar, SP Keely, NE Brinkman, JL Garland_


Greywater, the wastewater from sinks, showers, and laundry, is an understudied environment for bacterial communities. Most greywater studies focus on quantifying pathogens, often via proxies used in other wastewater, like fecal indicator bacteria; there is a need to identify more greywater-appropriate surrogates, like Staphylococcus sp. Sequencing-based studies have revealed distinct communities in different types of greywater as well as in different parts of greywater infrastructure, including biofilms on pipes, holding tanks, and filtration systems. The use of metagenomic sequencing provides high resolution on both the taxa and genes present, which may be of interest in cases like identifying pathogens and surrogates relevant to different matrices, monitoring antibiotic resistance genes, and understanding metabolic processes occurring in the system. Here we review what is known about bacterial communities in different types of greywater and its infrastructure. We suggest that wider adoption of environmental sequencing in greywater research is important because it can describe the entire bacterial community along with its metabolic capabilities, including pathways for removal of nutrients and organic materials. We briefly describe a metagenomic dataset comparing different types of greywater samples in a college dormitory building to highlight the type of questions these methods can address. Metagenomic sequencing can help further the understanding of greywater treatment for reuse because it allows for identification of new pathogens or genes of concern.
