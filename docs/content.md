 28.07.2022, _ZC Holmes, MM Villa, HK Durand, S Jiang, EP Dallow, BL Petrone, JD Silverman, PH Lin, LA David_


Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from gut bacteria are associated with protective roles in diseases ranging from obesity to colorectal cancers. Intake of microbially accessible dietary fibers (prebiotics) lead to varying effects on SCFA production in human studies, and gut microbial responses to nutritional interventions vary by individual. It is therefore possible that prebiotic therapies will require customizing to individuals.

Gastrointestinal dysfunction is a common symptom of acute mountain sickness (AMS). The gut microbiota and γδ T cells play critical roles in intestinal disease. However, the mechanistic link between the microbiota and γδ T cells in hypoxia-induced intestinal injury remains unclear. Here, we show that hypoxia-induced intestinal damage was significantly alleviated after microbiota depletion with antibiotics. Hypoxia modulated gut microbiota composition by promoting antimicrobial peptides angiogenin-4 secretions. The abundance of Clostridium in the gut of mice after hypoxia significantly decreased, while the abundance of Desulfovibrio significantly increased. Furthermore, Desulfovibrio-derived phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine promoted γδ T cell activation. In CD1d-deficient mice, the levels of intraepithelial IL-17A and γδ T cells and intestinal damage were significantly decreased compared with those in wild-type mice under hypoxia. Mechanistically, phospholipid metabolites from Desulfovibrio are presented by intestinal epithelial CD1d to induce the proliferation of IL-17A-producing γδ T cells, which aggravates intestinal injury. Gut microbiota-derived metabolites promote hypoxia-induced intestinal injury via CD1d-dependent γδ T cells, suggesting that phospholipid metabolites and γδ T cells can be targets for AMS therapy.

_Animals, Dioxygenases, Herbivory, Lycopersicon esculentum, Phylogeny, Plants, Tetranychidae_
Generalist herbivores such as the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae thrive on a wide variety of plants and can rapidly adapt to novel hosts. What traits enable polyphagous herbivores to cope with the diversity of secondary metabolites in their variable plant diet is unclear. Genome sequencing of T. urticae revealed the presence of 17 genes that code for secreted proteins with strong homology to "intradiol ring cleavage dioxygenases (DOGs)" from bacteria and fungi, and phylogenetic analyses show that they have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from fungi. In bacteria and fungi, DOGs have been well characterized and cleave aromatic rings in catecholic compounds between adjacent hydroxyl groups. Such compounds are found in high amounts in solanaceous plants like tomato, where they protect against herbivory. To better understand the role of this gene family in spider mites, we used a multi-disciplinary approach to functionally characterize the various T. urticae DOG genes.

## Microbiota-derived metabolites as drivers of gut-brain communication.
 29.07.2022, _H Ahmed, Q Leyrolle, V Koistinen, O Kärkkäinen, S Layé, N Delzenne, K Hanhineva_


Alterations in the gut microbiota composition have been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The gut microbes transform and metabolize dietary- and host-derived molecules generating a diverse group of metabolites with local and systemic effects. The bi-directional communication between brain and the microbes residing in the gut, the so-called gut-brain axis, consists of a network of immunological, neuronal, and endocrine signaling pathways. Although the full variety of mechanisms of the gut-brain crosstalk is yet to be established, the existing data demonstrates that a single metabolite or its derivatives are likely among the key inductors within the gut-brain axis communication. However, more research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying how gut microbiota associated metabolites alter brain functions, and to examine if different interventional approaches targeting the gut microbiota could be used in prevention and treatment of neurological disorders, as reviewed herein.Abbreviations:4-EPS 4-ethylphenylsulfate; 5-AVA(B) 5-aminovaleric acid (betaine); Aβ Amyloid beta protein; AhR Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ASD Autism spectrum disorder; BBB Blood-brain barrier; BDNF Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CNS Central nervous system; GABA ɣ-aminobutyric acid; GF Germ-free; MIA Maternal immune activation; SCFA Short-chain fatty acid; 3M-4-TMAB 3-methyl-4-(trimethylammonio)butanoate; 4-TMAP 4-(trimethylammonio)pentanoate; TMA(O) Trimethylamine(-N-oxide); TUDCA Tauroursodeoxycholic acid; ZO Zonula occludens proteins.

## Female reproductive dysfunctions and the gut microbiota.
 28.07.2022, _SB Chadchan, V Singh, R Kommagani_


The gut microbiome is considered an endocrine organ that can influence distant organs and associated biological pathways. Recent advances suggest that gut microbial homeostasis is essential for reproductive health and that perturbations in the gut microbiota can lead to reproductive pathologies. This review provides an updated overview of the relationship between the gut microbiome and female reproductive diseases. Specifically, we highlight the most recent findings on the gut microbiome in gynecological pathologies including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and endometrial cancer. Most studies revealed associations between altered gut microbial compositions and these reproductive diseases, though few have suggested cause-effect relationships. Future studies should focus on determining the molecular mechanisms underlying associations between gut microbiota and reproductive diseases. Understanding this bidirectional relationship could lead to the development of novel and effective strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat female reproductive organ-related diseases.

## A Bibliometric Review on Gut Microbiome and Alzheimer's Disease Between 2012 and 2021.
 29.07.2022, _AI Trejo-Castro, D Carrion-Alvarez, A Martinez-Torteya, C Rangel-Escareño_


Research on the microbiome has drawn an increasing amount of attention over the past decade. Even more so for its association with disease. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been a subject of study for a long time with slow success in improving diagnostic accuracy or identifying a possibility for treatment. In this work, we analyze past and current research on microbiome and its positive impact on AD treatment and diagnosis. We present a bibliometric analysis from 2012 to 2021 with data retrieved on September 2, 2021, from the Scopus database. The query includes "Gut AND (Microbiota OR Microbiome) AND Alzheimer*" within the article title, abstract, and keywords for all kinds of documents in the database. Compared with 2016, the number of publications (NPs) on the subject doubled by 2017. Moreover, we observe an exponential growth through 2020, and with the data presented, it is almost certain that it will continue this trend and grow even further in the upcoming years. We identify key journals interested in the subject and discuss the articles with most citations, analyzing trends and topics for future research, such as the ability to diagnose the disease and complement the cognitive test with other clinical biomarkers. According to the test, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is normally considered an initial stage for AD. This test, combined with the role of the gut microbiome in early stages of the disease, may improve the diagnostic accuracy. Based on our findings, there is emerging evidence that microbiota, perhaps more specifically gut microbiota, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diseases, such as AD.

## Tourmaline: A containerized workflow for rapid and iterable amplicon sequence analysis using QIIME 2 and Snakemake.
 28.07.2022, _LR Thompson, SR Anderson, PA Den Uyl, NV Patin, SJ Lim, G Sanderson, KD Goodwin_


Amplicon sequencing (metabarcoding) is a common method to survey diversity of environmental communities whereby a single genetic locus is amplified and sequenced from the DNA of whole or partial organisms, organismal traces (e.g., skin, mucus, feces), or microbes in an environmental sample. Several software packages exist for analyzing amplicon data, among which QIIME 2 has emerged as a popular option because of its broad functionality, plugin architecture, provenance tracking, and interactive visualizations. However, each new analysis requires the user to keep track of input and output file names, parameters, and commands; this lack of automation and standardization is inefficient and creates barriers to meta-analysis and sharing of results.
