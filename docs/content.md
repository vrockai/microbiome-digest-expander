This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Removal of nanoplastics in water treatment processes: A review.
 11.07.2022, _MK Devi, N Karmegam, S Manikandan, R Subbaiya, H Song, EE Kwon, B Sarkar, N Bolan, W Kim, J Rinklebe, M Govarthanan_


Nanoplastics are drawing more attention as a result of their propensity to spread across the environment and pose a threat to all organisms. The presence of nanoplastics in water is given more attention nowadays as the transit of nanoplastics occurs through the aquatic ecosphere besides terrestrial mobility. The principal removal procedures for macro-and micro-plastic particles are effective, but nanoparticles escape from the treatment, increasing in the water and significantly influencing the society. This critical review is aimed to bestow the removal technologies of nanoplastics from aquatic ecosystems, with a focus on the treatment of freshwater, drinking water, and wastewater, as well as the importance of transit and its impact on health concerns. Still, there exists a gap in providing a collective knowledge on the methods available for nanoplastics removal. Hence, this review offered various nanoplastic removal technologies (microorganism-based degradation, membrane separation with a reactor, and photocatalysis) that could be the practical/effective measures along with the traditional procedures (filtration, coagulation, centrifugation, flocculation, and gravity settling). From the analyses of different treatment systems, the effectiveness of nanoplastics removal depends on various factors, source, size, and type of nanoplastics apart from the treatment method adopted. Combined removal methods, filtration with coagulation offer great scope for the removal of nanoplastics from drinking water with &gt;99 % efficiency. The collected data could serve as base-line information for future research and development in water nanoplastics cleanup.

## Mitochondrial function in intestinal epithelium homeostasis and modulation in diet-induced obesity.
 11.07.2022, _T Guerbette, G Boudry, A Lan_


Systemic low-grade inflammation observed in diet-induced obesity has been associated with dysbiosis and disturbance of intestinal homeostasis. This latter relies on an efficient epithelial barrier and coordinated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) renewal that are supported by their mitochondrial function. However, IEC mitochondrial function might be impaired by high fat diet (HFD) consumption, notably through gut-derived metabolite production and fatty acids, that may act as metabolic perturbators of IEC.

## New insights of bacterial communities in fermented vegetables from shotgun metagenomics and identification of antibiotic resistance genes and probiotic bacteria.

Consumption of fermented foods has grown worldwide due to the purported health benefits. It is thus critical to understand fermented foods microbiome that mainly influences the quality and safety of these foods. This study identified bacterial communities, including functional profiles of probiotics and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), in pickled vegetables commonly consumed in the Middle Eastern, African, and Asian sub-continent regions. Eighteen samples from six pickled vegetables were collected from local markets in Saudi Arabia and analyzed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Statistical analyses revealed significant distance and separate clustering of bacterial communities among the different pickle types. Species of Levilactobacillus namurensis, Lentilactobacillus buchneri, Lentilactobacillus parafarraginis, Lactiplantibacillus pentosus, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Leuconostoc carnosum, Weissella confuse were found in a range of dominance in most of the samples. Binning revealed 33 high-quality, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 4 MAGs representing putatively novel species of Lactobacillus, Alcanivorax, and Dichelobacter. Moreover, 285 ARGs and variants produce resistance against 20 classes of antibiotics were retrieved, mostly from Enterobacteriaceae contigs. The metagenomes harbored relatively high abundances of carbohydrate fermentation enzymes, as well as metabolic pathways for amino acid metabolism, cofactors and vitamins biosynthesis. Overall, by providing a comprehensive overview of bacterial communities and probiotic bacteria in pickled vegetables, the results suggest the need for more hygienic processing to avoid Enterobacteriaceae contamination and ARG spread.
