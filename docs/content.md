This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of lettuce seed oil (LSO) on the performance, carcass yield, kidney and liver indices, immunity, lipid profile, and cecal microbiota of fattening chicks. A total of 200, 7-day-old Cobb-500 were distributed into 5 experimental groups; each group contained 5 replicates with 8 birds each. The first group 1) the basal diet (only); 2) the basal diet plus lettuce seed oil (0.50 mL/kg); 3) the basal diet plus lettuce seed oil (1.00 mL/kg); 4) the basal diet plus lettuce seed oil (1.50 mL/kg); and 5) the basal diet plus lettuce seed oil (2.00 mL/kg). No significant effect was observed on growth performance, carcass traits, or kidney function at any level of oil. But, liver function was significantly affected due to LSO levels. Serum lipid profiles (total cholesterol-TC, triglyceride-TG, low-density lipoprotein-LDL, and very low-density lipoprotein-VLDL) were significantly reduced by using LSO levels compared to the control group. Dietary LSO significantly increased immunological and antioxidant parameters, except for malondialdehyde-MDA, which was reduced. On the other hand, the cecal microbiota was significantly improved by LSO additives. It was concluded that the dietary supplementation of LSO had beneficial effects on liver and kidney functions, lipid profile, immunity, antioxidant parameters, and the bacteriology of fattening chicks.

## Improving the thermostability and modulating the inulin profile of inulosucrase through rational glycine-to-proline substitution.
 12.01.2024, _T Charoenwongpaiboon, N Sommanat, K Wangpaiboon, M Puangpathanachai, P Pongsawasdi, R Pichyangkura_


The flexibility of protein structure plays a crucial role in enzyme stability and catalysis. Among the amino acids, glycine is particularly important in conferring flexibility to proteins. In this study, the effects of flexible glycine residues in Lactobacillus reuteri 121 inulosucrase (LrInu) on stability and inulin profile were investigated through glycine-to-proline substitutions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to discover the flexible glycine residues, and eight glycine residues, including Gly217, Gly298, Gly330, Gly416, Gly450, Gly624, Gly627, Gly629, were selected for site-directed mutagenesis. The results demonstrated significant changes in both thermostability and inulin profiles of the variants. Particularly, the G624P and G627P variants showed reduced production of long-chain oligosaccharides compared to the WT. This can be ascribed to the increased rigidity of the active site, which is crucial for the induction-fit mechanism. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the role of flexible glycine residues in the activity, stability, and inulin synthesis of LrInu.

Metabolism of haem by-products such as bilirubin by humans and their gut microbiota is essential to human health, as excess serum bilirubin can cause jaundice and even neurological damage. The bacterial enzymes that reduce bilirubin to urobilinogen, a key step in this pathway, have remained unidentified. Here we used biochemical analyses and comparative genomics to identify BilR as a gut-microbiota-derived bilirubin reductase that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen. We delineated the BilR sequences from similar reductases through the identification of key residues critical for bilirubin reduction and found that BilR is predominantly encoded by Firmicutes species. Analysis of human gut metagenomes revealed that BilR is nearly ubiquitous in healthy adults, but prevalence is decreased in neonates and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. This discovery sheds light on the role of the gut microbiome in bilirubin metabolism and highlights the significance of the gut-liver axis in maintaining bilirubin homeostasis.

Establishing the infant's gut microbiota has long-term implications on health and immunity. Breastfeeding is recognized as the best practice of infant nutrition in comparison with formula feeding. We evaluated the effects of the primary feeding practices by analyzing the infant growth and the potential association with gut diseases. A cross-sectional and observational study was designed. This study included 55 mothers with infants, who were divided according to their feeding practices in breastfeeding (BF), formula feeding (FF), and combined breast and formula feeding (CF). Anthropometric measurements of the participants were recorded. Additionally, non-invasive fecal samples from the infants were collected to analyze the microbiota by sequencing, immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration (ELISA), and volatile organic compounds (gas chromatography with an electronic nose). Results showed that the microbiota diversity in the BF group was the highest compared to the other two groups. The IgA levels in the BF group were twice as high as those in the FF group. Moreover, the child´s growth in the BF group showed the best infant development when the data were compared at birth to the recollection time, as noted by the correlation with a decreased concentration of toxic volatile organic compounds. Interestingly, the CF group showed a significant difference in health status when the data were compared with the FF group. We conclude that early health practices influence children's growth, which is relevant to further research about how those infants' health evolved.

Aquaculture plays an important role in global protein supplies and food security. The ban on antibiotics as feed additive proposes urgent need to develop alternatives. Gut microbiota plays important roles in the metabolism and immunity of fish and has the potential to give rise to novel solutions for challenges confronted by fish culture. However, our understanding of fish gut microbiome is still lacking.

The observation that the intestinal microbiota is central in the development of IBD suggests that dietary fiber, the microbiota's primary source of nourishment, could play a central role in these diseases. Accordingly, enriching diets with specific soluble fibers remodels microbiota and modulates colitis sensitivity. In humans, a recent study suggests that the microbiota of select IBD patients might influence the impacts they would experience upon fiber exposure. We sought here to define the extent to which individual microbiotas varied in their responsiveness to purified soluble fiber inulin and psyllium. Moreover, the extent to which such variance might impact proneness to colitis.

The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.

## Discovery of a Biotin Synthase That Utilizes an Auxiliary 4Fe-5S Cluster for Sulfur Insertion.
 12.01.2024, _JC Lachowicz, D Lennox-Hvenekilde, N Myling-Petersen, B Salomonsen, G Verkleij, CG Acevedo-Rocha, B Caddell, LS Gronenberg, SC Almo, MOA Sommer, HJ Genee, TL Grove_


Biotin synthase (BioB) is a member of the Radical SAM superfamily of enzymes that catalyzes the terminal step of biotin (vitamin B7) biosynthesis, in which it inserts a sulfur atom in desthiobiotin to form a thiolane ring. How BioB accomplishes this difficult reaction has been the subject of much controversy, mainly around the source of the sulfur atom. However, it is now widely accepted that the sulfur atom inserted to form biotin stems from the sacrifice of the auxiliary 2Fe-2S cluster of BioB. Here, we bioinformatically explore the diversity of BioBs available in sequence databases and find an unexpected variation in the coordination of the auxiliary iron-sulfur cluster. After in vitro characterization, including the determination of biotin formation and representative crystal structures, we report a new type of BioB utilized by virtually all obligate anaerobic organisms. Instead of a 2Fe-2S cluster, this novel type of BioB utilizes an auxiliary 4Fe-5S cluster. Interestingly, this auxiliary 4Fe-5S cluster contains a ligated sulfide that we propose is used for biotin formation. We have termed this novel type of BioB, Type II BioB, with the E. coli 2Fe-2S cluster sacrificial BioB representing Type I. This surprisingly ubiquitous Type II BioB has implications for our understanding of the function and evolution of Fe-S clusters in enzyme catalysis, highlighting the difference in strategies between the anaerobic and aerobic world.

## Dietary supplementation with a mixture of Dunaliella salina and Spirulina enhances broiler performance by improving growth, immunity, digestive enzymes and gut microbiota.
 12.01.2024, _MA Alghamdi, MI Elbaz, IE Ismail, FM Reda, M Alagawany, KA El-Tarabily, AS Abdelgeliel_


The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Dunaliella salina and Spirulina (D + S) mixture on performance, carcass yield, kidney and liver markers, lipid profile, and immune responses of fattening chicks. Two hundred broiler chicks at 7 days old were distributed into 5 experimental groups, 5 replicates each with 8 chicks each. Group 1 was fed on only basal diet; group 2 was fed with basal diet and 0.50 g/kg (D + S); group 3 was fed with basal diet and 1.00 g/kg (D + S); group 4 was fed with basal diet and 1.50 g/kg (D + S); and group 5 was fed with basal diet supplemented with 2.00 g/kg (D + S). The additive mixture (D + S) consisted of (1 D. salina: 1 Spirulina). The experiment lasted for 6 wk. The results demonstrated significantly improved better live body weight, body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio (P&lt;0.01) for groups that received (D + S) at levels of 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg diet compared to other groups at 6 wk of age. There was no significant influence of different levels of dietary feed additives on feed intake or carcass traits. The lipid profile was improved through a reduction of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) values and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) values, as well as the immune response, which was improved through increasing values of complement 3, immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the birds treated with (D + S) compared to the control group. The inclusion of all levels of (D + S)/kg decreased triglyceride, while total protein, albumen, and globulin values (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01) were higher compared to other groups. The inclusion of the different levels of (D + S)/kg improved liver function, whereas aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were lower than in other groups (P&lt;0.001). The lowest values of creatinine, urea, and uric acid were noted in birds fed a diet supplemented with 1.50 g (D + S)/kg. Antioxidant levels were improved through increasing values of catalase (CAT) and reduced glutathione (GSH) enzymes in the treated birds with (D + S) compared with the control chicks. Furthermore, digestive enzymes and microbial content were improved in broiler checks fed on diet supplemented with (D + S) compared to the control group. In conclusion, supplementing broiler chicks with a dietary D. salina and Spirulina combination increased their productive performance, immunity, kidney and liver function, lipid profile, and digestive enzymes.

The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of lettuce seed oil (LSO) on the performance, carcass yield, kidney and liver indices, immunity, lipid profile, and cecal microbiota of fattening chicks. A total of 200, 7-day-old Cobb-500 were distributed into 5 experimental groups; each group contained 5 replicates with 8 birds each. The first group 1) the basal diet (only); 2) the basal diet plus lettuce seed oil (0.50 mL/kg); 3) the basal diet plus lettuce seed oil (1.00 mL/kg); 4) the basal diet plus lettuce seed oil (1.50 mL/kg); and 5) the basal diet plus lettuce seed oil (2.00 mL/kg). No significant effect was observed on growth performance, carcass traits, or kidney function at any level of oil. But, liver function was significantly affected due to LSO levels. Serum lipid profiles (total cholesterol-TC, triglyceride-TG, low-density lipoprotein-LDL, and very low-density lipoprotein-VLDL) were significantly reduced by using LSO levels compared to the control group. Dietary LSO significantly increased immunological and antioxidant parameters, except for malondialdehyde-MDA, which was reduced. On the other hand, the cecal microbiota was significantly improved by LSO additives. It was concluded that the dietary supplementation of LSO had beneficial effects on liver and kidney functions, lipid profile, immunity, antioxidant parameters, and the bacteriology of fattening chicks.

Nanodecoy systems based on analogues of viral cellular receptors assembled onto fluid lipid-based membranes of nano/extravescicles are potential new tools to complement classic therapeutic or preventive antiviral approaches. The need for lipid-based membranes for transmembrane receptor anchorage may pose technical challenges along industrial translation, calling for alternative geometries for receptor multimerization. Here we developed a semisynthetic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanodecoy by multimerizing the biotin labelled virus cell receptor -ACE2- ectodomain onto a poly-avidin nanoparticle (NP) based on the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly-ANANAS. The ability of the assembly to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and the affinity of the ACE2:viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction were measured at different ACE2:NP ratios. At ACE2:NP = 30, 90 % SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition at ACE2 nanomolar concentration was registered on both Wuhan and Omicron variants, with ten-fold higher potency than the monomeric protein. Lower and higher ACE2 densities were less efficient suggesting that functional recognition between multi-ligand NPs and multi-receptor virus surfaces requires optimal geometrical relationships. In vivo studies in mice showed that the biodistribution and safety profiles of the nanodecoy are potentially suitable for preventing viral infection upon nasal instillation. Viral receptor multimerization using ANANAS is a convenient process which, in principle, could be rapidly adapted to counteract also other viral infections.

The rhizosheath, a cohesive soil layer firmly adhering to plant roots, plays a vital role in facilitating water and mineral uptake. In pearl millet, rhizosheath formation is genetically controlled and influenced by root exudates. Here, we investigated the impact of root exudates on the microbiota composition, interactions, and assembly processes, and rhizosheath structure in pearl millet using four distinct lines with contrasting soil aggregation abilities.

## mEnrich-seq: methylation-guided enrichment sequencing of bacterial taxa of interest from microbiome.

Metagenomics has enabled the comprehensive study of microbiomes. However, many applications would benefit from a method that sequences specific bacterial taxa of interest, but not most background taxa. We developed mEnrich-seq (in which 'm' stands for methylation and seq for sequencing) for enriching taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self versus nonself differentiation by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, individually or in combination, to deplete host and background taxa while enriching targeted taxa. This idea is integrated with library preparation procedures and applied in several applications to enrich (up to 117-fold) pathogenic or beneficial bacteria from human urine and fecal samples, including species that are hard to culture or of low abundance. We assessed 4,601 bacterial strains with mapped methylomes so far and showed broad applicability of mEnrich-seq. mEnrich-seq provides microbiome researchers with a versatile and cost-effective approach for selective sequencing of diverse taxa of interest.

Diverse host factors drive microbial variation in plant-associated environments, whereas their genetic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. To address this, we coupled the analyses of plant genetics and microbiomes in this study. Using 100 tea plant (Camellia sinensis) cultivars, the microbiomes of rhizosphere, root endosphere and phyllosphere showed clear compartment-specific assembly, whereas the subpopulation differentiation of tea cultivars exhibited small effects on microbial variation in each compartment. Through microbiome genome-wide association studies, we examined the interactions between tea genetic loci and microbial variation. Notably, genes related to the cell wall and carbon catabolism were heavily linked to root endosphere microbial composition, whereas genes related to the metabolism of metal ions and small organic molecules were overrepresented in association with rhizosphere microbial composition. Moreover, a set of tea genetic variants, including the cytoskeleton-related formin homology interacting protein 1 gene, were strongly associated with the β-diversity of phyllosphere microbiomes, implying their interactions with the overall structure of microbial communities. Our results create a catalogue of tea genetic determinants interacting with microbiomes and reveal the compartment-specific microbiome assembly driven by host genetics.

## Mycoplasma pneumoniae epidemic in Denmark, October to December, 2023.
 12.01.2024, _AC Nordholm, B Søborg, P Jokelainen, K Lauenborg Møller, L Flink Sørensen, T Grove Krause, S Anker Uldum, HD Emborg_


We report a surge of patients, especially children and adolescents, with respiratory disease caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Denmark since October 2023. While the surge has reached an epidemic level, no impact on hospital capacity has been observed; only 14% (446/3,195) of cases, primarily adults, required hospitalisation. Macrolide resistance was detected in less than 2% of samples tested. Timely monitoring of hospitalisations linked to M. pneumoniae infections has been established to inform the healthcare system, decisionmakers and the public.
