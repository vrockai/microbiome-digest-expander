Poor oral health has broad consequences that can be seen at personal as well as societal levels, especially in developing countries like India. We have limited information on the healthy oral cavity's inhabitant microorganisms that play a crucial role in overall oral health. In a comprehensive culture-independent approach, the bacterial composition of healthy human oral cavities was determined from a sub-population of northern India. During this study, 20 mouthwash-derived metagenomes were explored for identifying bacterial diversity using the 16S rRNA hypervariable V3 region with the MiSeq Illumina platform. On the taxonomy assignment of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 20 assigned phyla and 162 genera were recovered among the participants. The mean relative abundance revealed that Streptococcus was the dominant genera among the participants. However, at inter-individual analysis, Neisseria and Haemophilus exhibited first-order dominance among five and three healthy individuals, respectively. Correlation studies indicate that Streptococcus shares a strong relationship with Rothia, Corynebacterium, Prevotella, and Veillonella, whereas it was negatively correlated with Neisseria, Aggregatibacter, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacteria like Gram-negative bacteria. Bacterial diversity showed insignificant differences at the level of age and gender within and between the participants. The results support several of the major findings of previous reports on the healthy oral microbiome of the Indian population, however, the present investigation further illustrates that demographic region leaves an impact on overall bacterial composition. The study will assist in a better understanding of the oral microbiome from region-specific Indian population that was otherwise highly under-represented.

## A review on preventive role of ketogenic diet (KD) in CNS disorders from the gut microbiota perspective.
 19.10.2020, _K Rawat, N Singh, P Kumari, L Saha_


The gut microbiota plays an important role in neurological diseases via the gut-brain axis. Many factors such as diet, antibiotic therapy, stress, metabolism, age, geography and genetics are known to play a critical role in regulating the colonization pattern of the microbiota. Recent studies have shown the role of the low carbohydrate, adequate protein, and high fat "ketogenic diet" in remodeling the composition of the gut microbiome and thereby facilitating protective effects in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Gut microbes are found to be involved in the pathogenesis of various CNS disorders like epilepsy, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stress, anxiety and depression. In vivo studies have shown an intricate link between gut microbes and KD and specific microbes/probiotics proved useful in in vivo CNS disease models. In the present review, we discuss the gut-brain bidirectional axis and the underlying mechanism of KD-based therapy targeting gut microbiome in in vivo animal models and clinical studies in neurological diseases. Also, we tried to infer how KD by altering the microbiota composition contributes towards the protective role in various CNS disorders. This review helps to uncover the mechanisms that are utilized by the KD and gut microbiota to modulate gut-brain axis functions and may provide novel opportunities to target therapies to the gut to treat neurologic disorders.

## Challenges in microbiological identification of aerobic bacteria isolated from the skin of reptiles.

Bacterial pathogens are often involved in dermatitis in reptiles. Exact identification of reptile-specific but otherwise uncommon bacterial species may be challenging. However, identification is crucial to evaluate the importance of the detected bacterial species.

## Natural vertical infection by dengue virus serotype 4, Zika virus and Mayaro virus in Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti and Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus.

Vertical transmission to progeny ensures the maintenance of arboviruses in their natural vectors. This mechanism is largely reported for dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). Few studies have addressed this mechanism for Zika virus (ZIKV), Mayaro virus (MAYV) and other arboviruses. The present study investigated the natural infection rate by arboviruses in 4490 Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti and 296 Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) reared from eggs collected with ovitraps in Cuiabá, Mato Grosso State, from February to July, 2017. After viral RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction protocols for 10 flaviviruses and five alphaviruses, nucleotide sequencing and three passages in C6/36 cells, eight pools of Ae. aegypti positive for DENV-4 genotype II, seven for ZIKV Asian genotype and two for MAYV genotype L were found. In addition, two Ae. albopictus pools were positive for DENV-4 genotype II and two were positive for ZIKV Asian genotype. Infection was confirmed by viral isolation in all positive pools for DENV-4 and for MAYV and in eight of nine for ZIKV. This mechanism may contribute to the spread of arboviruses during epidemics and also to their maintenance in natural vectors during interepidemic periods.
