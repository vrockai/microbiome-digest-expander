## Advances and challenges in cataloging the human gut virome.
 14.07.2022, _J Li, F Yang, M Xiao, A Li_


The human gut virome, which is often referred to as the "dark matter" of the gut microbiome, remains understudied. A better understanding of the composition and variations of the gut virome across populations is critical for exploring its impact on diseases and health. A series of advances in the characterization of human gut virome have unveiled high genetic diversity and various functional potentials of gut viruses. Here, we summarize the recently available human gut virome databases and discuss their features, procedures, and challenges with the intention to provide a reference to researchers to use while choosing a profiling database. We also propose a "best practice" for cataloging the viral population.

## Diversity of the repetitive DNA fraction in Cestrum, the genus with the largest genomes within Solanaceae.
 09.07.2022, _TB de Souza, LM Parteka, R de Assis, ALL Vanzela_


Cestrum species present large genomes (2 C = ~ 24 pg), a high occurrence of B chromosomes and great diversity in heterochromatin bands. Despite this diversity, karyotypes maintain the chromosome number 2n = 16 (except when they present B chromosomes), and a relative similarity in chromosome morphology and symmetry. To deepen our knowledge of the Cestrum genome composition, low-coverage sequencing data of C. strigilatum and C. elegans were compared, including cytogenomic analyses of seven species.

## Comparison of the respiratory tract microbiome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with different disease severity.

Little is known about the characteristics of respiratory tract microbiome in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inpatients with different severity. We conducted a study that expected to clarify these characteristics as much as possible. A cross-sectional study was conducted to characterize respiratory tract microbial communities of 69 COVID-19 inpatients from 64 nasopharyngeal swabs and 5 sputum specimens using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V3-V4 region sequencing. The bacterial profiles were analyzed to find potential biomarkers by the two-step method, the combination of random forest model and the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), and explore the connections with clinical characteristics by Spearman's rank test. Compared with mild COVID-19 patients, severe patients had significantly decreased bacterial diversity (P values were less than 0.05 in the alpha and beta diversity) and relative lower abundance of opportunistic pathogens, including Actinomyces, Prevotella, Rothia, Streptococcus, Veillonella. Eight potential biomarkers including Treponema, Leptotrichia, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Parvimonas, Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Gemella and Streptococcus were found to distinguish the mild COVID-19 patients from the severe COVID-19 patients. The genera of Actinomyces and Prevotella were negatively correlated with age in two groups. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, neutrophil count (GRA) and lymphocyte count (LYMPH) were significantly correlated with different genera in the two groups. In addition, there were a positive correlation between Klebsiella and white blood cell count (WBC) in two groups. The respiratory tract microbiome had significant differences in COVID-19 patients with different severity. The value of the respiratory tract microbiome as predictive biomarkers for COVID-19 severity deserves further exploration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

## An international report on bacterial communities in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

The incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is disproportionately high in the eastern corridor of Africa and parts of Asia. Emerging research has identified a potential association between poor oral health and ESCC. One possible link between poor oral health and ESCC involves the alteration of the microbiome. We performed an integrated analysis of four independent sequencing efforts of ESCC tumors from patients from high- and low-incidence regions of the world. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of ESCC tumors from 61 patients in Tanzania, we identified a community of bacteria, including members of the genera Fusobacterium, Selenomonas, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Porphyromonas, Veillonella, and Campylobacter, present at high abundance in ESCC tumors. We then characterized the microbiome of 238 ESCC tumor specimens collected in two additional independent sequencing efforts consisting of patients from other high-ESCC incidence regions (Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya, Iran, China). This analysis revealed similar ESCC-associated bacterial communities in these cancers. Because these genera are traditionally considered members of the oral microbiota, we next explored whether there was a relationship between the synchronous saliva and tumor microbiomes of ESCC patients in Tanzania. Comparative analyses revealed that paired saliva and tumor microbiomes were significantly similar with a specific enrichment of Fusobacterium and Prevotella in the tumor microbiome. Together, these data indicate that cancer-associated oral bacteria are associated with ESCC tumors at the time of diagnosis and support a model in which oral bacteria are present in high abundance in both saliva and tumors of some ESCC patients.
