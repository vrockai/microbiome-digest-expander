## Influence of Baseline Positron Emission Tomography in Metastatic Gastroesophageal Cancer on Survival and Response to Therapy.
 05.08.2021, _A Abdelhakeem, M Patnana, X Wang, JE Rogers, MB Murphy, T Sagebiel, N Ikoma, BD Badgwell, A Trail, JS Estrella, Y Lu, C Devine, JA Ajani_


The value of baseline fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) remains uncertain once gastroesophageal cancer is metastatic. We hypothesized that assessment of detailed PET-CT parameters (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax] and/or total lesion glycolysis [TLG]), and the extent of metastatic burden could aid prediction of probability of response or prognosticate.

Muscle fibre conduction velocity (MFCV) is a basic physiological parameter biophysically related to the diameter of muscle fibres and properties of the sarcolemma. The aim of this study was to assess the intersession reproducibility of the relation between voluntary force and estimates of average muscle fibre conduction velocity (MFCV) from multichannel high-density surface electromyographic recordings (HDsEMG). Ten healthy men performed six linearly increasing isometric ankle dorsiflexions on two separate experimental sessions, 4 weeks apart. Each session involved the recordings of voluntary force during maximal isometric (MViF) and submaximal ramp contractions at 35-50-70% of MViF. Concurrently, the HDsEMG activity was detected from the tibialis anterior muscle and MFCV estimates were derived in 250-ms epochs. Absolute and relative reproducibility of MFCV initial value (intercept) and rate of change (regression slope) as a function of force were assessed by within-subject coefficient of correlation (CVw) and with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). MFCV was positively correlated with voluntary force (R2 = 0.75 ± 0.12) in all individuals and test conditions (P &lt; 0.001). Average CVw for MFCV intercept and slope were of 2.6 ± 2.0% and 11.9 ± 3.2% and ICC values of 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. Overall, MFCV regression coefficients showed a high degree of intersession reproducibility in both absolute and relative terms. These results may have important practical implications in the tracking of training-induced neuromuscular changes and/or in the monitoring of the progress of neuromuscular disorders when a full sEMG signal decomposition is problematic or not possible.

## Comparison of porcine and human acellular dermal matrix outcomes in wound healing: a deep dive into the evidence.
 05.08.2021, _EC Saricilar, S Huang_


Acellular dermal matrices (ADM) are a novel graft. The goal of this systematic review is to evaluate the evidence behind differences in human and porcine ADM, irrelevant of manufacturing method, and to determine if there is enough of an evidence base to change clinical practice. An extensive literature search was performed through MEDLINE and Embase with search terms defining a population, intervention and outcome. Title and abstract exclusion were performed with other exclusion criteria. In 191 articles were found after exclusion of duplicates, with only 29 remaining following exclusions. Ten studies were found to have level I and II evidence (I=3, II=8), of which two were histopathological, one was an animal model, one was a systematic review, and six were clinical. The remaining studies were reviewed and considered for discussion, but did not hold high enough standards for medical evidence. Strong clinical evidence already exists for the use of human ADM, but questions of access, cost, and ethics require consideration of a xenograft. Histopathologically, evidence suggests minimal long-term differences between human and porcine ADM, although there is a short acute immune response with porcine ADM. Clinically, there is limited difference in outcomes, with a small range in effect of different ADM preparations. Considering the effectiveness of ADM in wound healing, more high-level research with appropriate statistical analysis to facilitate a future meta-analysis is recommended to justify a transition from human to porcine ADM.

## A Scale-Free, Fully Connected Global Transition Network Underlies Known Microbiome Diversity.
 13.07.2021, _G Jing, Y Zhang, L Liu, Z Wang, Z Sun, R Knight, X Su, J Xu_


Microbiomes are inherently linked by their structural similarity, yet the global features of such similarity are not clear. Here, we propose as a solution a search-based microbiome transition network. By traversing a composition-similarity-based network of 177,022 microbiomes, we show that although the compositions are distinct by habitat, each microbiome is on-average only seven neighbors from any other microbiome on Earth, indicating the inherent homology of microbiomes at the global scale. This network is scale-free, suggesting a high degree of stability and robustness in microbiome transition. By tracking the minimum spanning tree in this network, a global roadmap of microbiome dispersal was derived that tracks the potential paths of formulating and propagating microbiome diversity. Such search-based global microbiome networks, reconstructed within hours on just one computing node, provide a readily expanded reference for tracing the origin and evolution of existing or new microbiomes. IMPORTANCE It remains unclear whether and how compositional changes at the "community to community" level among microbiomes are linked to the origin and evolution of global microbiome diversity. Here we propose a microbiome transition model and a network-based analysis framework to describe and simulate the variation and dispersal of the global microbial beta-diversity across multiple habitats. The traversal of a transition network with 177,022 samples shows the inherent homology of microbiome at the global scale. Then a global roadmap of microbiome dispersal derived from the network tracks the potential paths of formulating and propagating microbiome diversity. Such search-based microbiome network provides a readily expanded reference for tracing the origin and evolution of existing or new microbiomes at the global scale.

## Crosstalk between γδ T cells and the microbiota.
 03.08.2021, _PH Papotto, B Yilmaz, B Silva-Santos_


The role of the microbiota in the development and function of γδ T cells-a T cell subset characterized by a T cell receptor composed of one γ-chain and one δ-chain-has been investigated in multiple organs in mice and humans. Interactions between the microbiota and γδ T cells affect both tissue homeostasis and disease pathologies. Notably, microbiota-induced interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing-γδ T cells can mediate a range of immunological processes, from metabolic disorders to neuroinflammation via the gut-brain axis. However, the bidirectional interactions between γδ T cells and the microbiota have not been fully determined. In this Perspective, we dissect the roles of microbiota in modulating γδ T cell development and function, and evaluate the evidence for γδ T cell selection of commensal communities. We also discuss the potential implications of these cells in health and disease and the major open questions and research avenues in the field.

## Host adaptation in gut Firmicutes is associated with sporulation loss and altered transmission cycle.
 05.08.2021, _HP Browne, A Almeida, N Kumar, K Vervier, AT Adoum, E Viciani, NJR Dawson, SC Forster, C Cormie, D Goulding, TD Lawley_


Human-to-human transmission of symbiotic, anaerobic bacteria is a fundamental evolutionary adaptation essential for membership of the human gut microbiota. However, despite its importance, the genomic and biological adaptations underpinning symbiont transmission remain poorly understood. The Firmicutes are a dominant phylum within the intestinal microbiota that are capable of producing resistant endospores that maintain viability within the environment and germinate within the intestine to facilitate transmission. However, the impact of host transmission on the evolutionary and adaptive processes within the intestinal microbiota remains unknown.

## The management of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma in the setting of pregnancy: seeking for clinical practice guidelines.
 05.08.2021, _R Elia, M Maruccia, A De Pascale, A Di Napoli, G Ingravallo, G Giudice_


Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a recently described form of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma now formally recognized by the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms. The aim of this paper is to report the first case of BIA-ALCL diagnosed in a pregnant patient. It is well known that BIA-ALCL appears as an indolent lymphoma with a good prognosis when diag-nosed at early stages and clinical guidelines for its management have been clearly published. Nevertheless, they lack a standardized approach for BIA-ALCL during pregnancy. With limited experience in our case, treatment has been safely postponed after term without affecting patient's overall prognosis and without fetal complication. The fact that the disease was diagnosed at an early stage (stage I) undoubtedly influenced the course of treatment. A multidisciplinary approach weighing the risks and benefits of treatment is of paramount importance in order to ensure the best possible outcome for both the mother and her child and clinical update guidelines should be issued.

## Financial Impact of an Automated Oncology Dose-Rounding Initiative: One-Year Analysis.
 05.08.2021, _JC Dela-Pena, KA Eschenburg, VW LaRocca, D Patel, SM Hough_


Infusion drugs are regarded as one of the high-cost health care expenditures. One approach to decrease drug expenditures is by dose-rounding biologics and cytotoxic agents. The Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy Association recommends that biologic and cytotoxic agents are rounded to the nearest vial size if they are within 10% of the ordered dose. The purpose of this initiative is to determine the impact of an automated dose-rounding algorithm on drug expenses.

## Prolonged drought imparts lasting compositional changes to the rice root microbiome.
 23.07.2021, _C Santos-Medellín, Z Liechty, J Edwards, B Nguyen, B Huang, BC Weimer, V Sundaresan_


Microbial symbioses can mitigate drought stress in crops but harnessing these beneficial interactions will require an in-depth understanding of root microbiome responses to drought cycles. Here, by detailed temporal characterization of root-associated microbiomes of rice plants during drought stress and recovery, we find that endosphere communities remained compositionally altered after rewatering, with prolonged droughts leading to decreased resilience. Several endospheric Actinobacteria were significantly enriched during drought and for weeks after rewatering. Notably, the most abundant endosphere taxon during this period was a Streptomyces, and a corresponding isolate promoted root growth. Additionally, drought stress disrupted the temporal dynamics of late-colonizing microorganisms, permanently altering the normal successional trends of root microbiota. These findings reveal that severe drought results in enduring impacts on rice root microbiomes, including enrichment of taxonomic groups that could shape the recovery response of the host, and have implications relevant to drought protection strategies using root microbiota.

_Drug Resistance, Microbial, Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Genomics, Plasmids, Virulence Factors_
Plasmids are mobile genetic elements, key in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, virulence determinants and other adaptive traits in bacteria. Obtaining a robust method for plasmid classification is necessary to better understand the genetics and epidemiology of many pathogens. Until now, plasmid classification systems focused on specific traits, which limited their precision and universality. The definition of plasmid taxonomic units (PTUs), based on average nucleotide identity metrics, allows the generation of a universal plasmid classification scheme, applicable to all bacterial taxa. Here we present COPLA, a software able to assign plasmids to known and novel PTUs, based on their genomic sequence.

## Strainberry: automated strain separation in low-complexity metagenomes using long reads.
 27.07.2021, _R Vicedomini, C Quince, AE Darling, R Chikhi_


High-throughput short-read metagenomics has enabled large-scale species-level analysis and functional characterization of microbial communities. Microbiomes often contain multiple strains of the same species, and different strains have been shown to have important differences in their functional roles. Recent advances on long-read based methods enabled accurate assembly of bacterial genomes from complex microbiomes and an as-yet-unrealized opportunity to resolve strains. Here we present Strainberry, a metagenome assembly pipeline that performs strain separation in single-sample low-complexity metagenomes and that relies uniquely on long-read data. We benchmarked Strainberry on mock communities for which it produces strain-resolved assemblies with near-complete reference coverage and 99.9% base accuracy. We also applied Strainberry on real datasets for which it improved assemblies generating 20-118% additional genomic material than conventional metagenome assemblies on individual strain genomes. We show that Strainberry is also able to refine microbial diversity in a complex microbiome, with complete separation of strain genomes. We anticipate this work to be a starting point for further methodological improvements on strain-resolved metagenome assembly in environments of higher complexities.

## STRONG: metagenomics strain resolution on assembly graphs.
 30.07.2021, _C Quince, S Nurk, S Raguideau, R James, OS Soyer, JK Summers, A Limasset, AM Eren, R Chikhi, AE Darling_


We introduce STrain Resolution ON assembly Graphs (STRONG), which identifies strains de novo, from multiple metagenome samples. STRONG performs coassembly, and binning into metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), and stores the coassembly graph prior to variant simplification. This enables the subgraphs and their unitig per-sample coverages, for individual single-copy core genes (SCGs) in each MAG, to be extracted. A Bayesian algorithm, BayesPaths, determines the number of strains present, their haplotypes or sequences on the SCGs, and abundances. STRONG is validated using synthetic communities and for a real anaerobic digestor time series generates haplotypes that match those observed from long Nanopore reads.

A major bottleneck in the use of metagenome sequencing for human gut microbiome studies has been the lack of a comprehensive genome collection to be used as a reference database. Several recent efforts have been made to re-construct genomes from human gut metagenome data, resulting in a huge increase in the number of relevant genomes. In this work, we aimed to create a collection of the most prevalent healthy human gut prokaryotic genomes, to be used as a reference database, including both MAGs from the human gut and ordinary RefSeq genomes.
