Human microbiotas are communities of microorganisms living in symbiosis with humans. They play an important role in the host immune response to respiratory viral infection. However, evidence on the human microbiome and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) relationship is insufficient. The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate existing evidence on the association between the microbiome and COVID-19 in humans and summarize these data in the pandemic era.

The gut microbiome may play a role in inflammation associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) development. This cross-sectional study examined its relation with glycemic status within a subset of the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) and estimated the association of circulating bacterial endotoxin (measured as plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP)) with T2D, which may be mediated by C-reactive protein (CRP).
