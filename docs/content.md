The aim of the present scoping review was to determine the characteristics of studies evaluating fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), as well as its effects and safety as a therapeutic intervention for people living with HIV. We conducted a scoping review following the methodology of the Joanna Briggs Institute. We searched the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Medline until September 19, 2021. Studies that used FMT in people living with HIV and explored its effects on the health of these people were included. Two randomized and two uncontrolled clinical trials with a total of 55 participants were included. Participants were well-controlled HIV infected people. Regarding microbiota changes, three studies found significant post-FMT increases in Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Î±-diversity, Chao-index, and/or Shannon-index, and/or decreases in Bacteroides. Regarding markers of intestinal damage, one study found a decrease in intestinal fatty-acid binding protein post- FMT, and another study found an increase in zonulin. Other outcomes evaluated by the studies were: markers of immune and inflammatory activation, markers of immunocompetence (CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes), and HIV viral load; however, none showed significant changes. Clinical outcomes were not evaluated by these studies. Regarding the safety of FMT, only mild adverse events were appreciated. No serious adverse events were reported. The clinical evidence for FMT in people living with HIV is sparse. FMT appears to have good tolerability and, no serious adverse events have been reported so far. Further clinical trials and evaluation of clinically important biomedical outcomes for FMT in people living with HIV are needed.

## Microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites in vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease.
 22.04.2022, _N Paeslack, M Mimmler, S Becker, Z Gao, MP Khuu, A Mann, F Malinarich, T Regen, C Reinhardt_


The essential amino acid tryptophan (Trp) is metabolized by gut commensals, yielding in compounds that affect innate immune cell functions directly, but also acting on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), thus regulating the maintenance of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), promoting T helper 17 (TH17) cell differentiation, and interleukin-22 production. In addition, microbiota-derived Trp metabolites have direct effects on the vascular endothelium, thus influencing the development of vascular inflammatory phenotypes. Indoxyl sulfate was demonstrated to promote vascular inflammation, whereas indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde had protective roles. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence for a contributory role of microbiota-derived indole-derivatives in blood pressure regulation and hypertension. Interestingly, there are indications for a role of the kynurenine pathway in atherosclerotic lesion development. Here, we provide an overview on the emerging role of gut commensals in the modulation of Trp metabolism and its influence in cardiovascular disease development.

## Role of diet and its effects on the gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of mental disorders.
 22.04.2022, _J Horn, DE Mayer, S Chen, EA Mayer_


_Autism Spectrum Disorder, Brain, Brain Diseases, Cross-Sectional Studies, Diet, Epilepsy, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Mental Disorders_
There is emerging evidence that diet has a major modulatory influence on brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) interactions with important implications for brain health, and for several brain disorders. The BGM system is made up of neuroendocrine, neural, and immune communication channels which establish a network of bidirectional interactions between the brain, the gut and its microbiome. Diet not only plays a crucial role in shaping the gut microbiome, but it can modulate structure and function of the brain through these communication channels. In this review, we summarize the evidence available from preclinical and clinical studies on the influence of dietary habits and interventions on a selected group of psychiatric and neurologic disorders including depression, cognitive decline, Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. We will particularly address the role of diet-induced microbiome changes which have been implicated in these effects, and some of which are shared between different brain disorders. While the majority of these findings have been demonstrated in preclinical and in cross-sectional, epidemiological studies, to date there is insufficient evidence from mechanistic human studies to make conclusions about causality between a specific diet and microbially mediated brain function. Many of the dietary benefits on microbiome and brain health have been attributed to anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the microbial metabolites of dietary fiber and polyphenols. The new attention given to dietary factors in brain disorders has the potential to improve treatment outcomes with currently available pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies.

## Longitudinal analysis of the impact of oral contraceptive use on the gut microbiome.
 25.04.2022, _X Hua, Y Cao, DM Morgan, K Miller, SM Chin, D Bellavance, H Khalili_


Introduction. Evidence has linked exogenous and endogenous sex hormones with the human microbiome.Hypothesis/Gap statement. The longitudinal effects of oral contraceptives (OC) on the human gut microbiome have not previously been studied.Aim. We sought to examine the longitudinal impact of OC use on the taxonomic composition and metabolic functions of the gut microbiota and endogenous sex steroid hormones after initiation of OC use.Methodology. We recruited ten healthy women who provided blood and stool samples prior to OC use, 1 month and 6 months after starting OC. We measured serum levels of sex hormones, including estradiol, progesterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and total testosterone. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from faecal samples. Species and metabolic pathway abundances were determined using MetaPhlAn2 and HUMAnN2. Multivariate association with linear models was used to identify microbial species and metabolic pathways associated with OC use and endogenous levels of sex hormones.Results. The percentage variance of the microbial community explained by individual factors ranged from 9.9 % for age to 2.7 % for time since initiation of OC use. We observed no changes in the diversity or composition of the gut microbiome following OC initiation. However, the relative abundance of the biosynthesis pathways of peptidoglycan, amino acids (lysine, threonine, methionine, and tryptophan), and the NAD salvage pathway increased after OC initiation. In addition, serum levels of estradiol and SHBG were positively associated with Eubacterium ramulus, a flavonoid-degrading bacterium. Similarly, microbes involving biosynthesis of l-lysine, l-threonine, and l-methionine were significantly associated with lower estradiol, SHBG, and higher levels of total testosterone.Conclusion. Our study provides the first piece of evidence supporting the association between exogenous and endogenous sex hormones and gut microbiome composition and function.

## Longitudinal gut virome analysis identifies specific viral signatures that precede necrotizing enterocolitis onset in preterm infants.
 22.04.2022, _EA Kaelin, C Rodriguez, C Hall-Moore, JA Hoffmann, LA Linneman, IM Ndao, BB Warner, PI Tarr, LR Holtz, ES Lim_


Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious consequence of preterm birth and is often associated with gut bacterial microbiome alterations. However, little is known about the development of the gut virome in preterm infants, or its role in NEC. Here, using metagenomic sequencing, we characterized the DNA gut virome of 9 preterm infants who developed NEC and 14 gestational age-matched preterm infants who did not. Infants were sampled longitudinally before NEC onset over the first 11 weeks of life. We observed substantial interindividual variation in the gut virome between unrelated preterm infants, while intraindividual variation over time was significantly less. We identified viral and bacterial signatures in the gut that preceded NEC onset. Specifically, we observed a convergence towards reduced viral beta diversity over the 10 d before NEC onset, which was driven by specific viral signatures and accompanied by specific viral-bacterial interactions. Our results indicate that bacterial and viral perturbations precede the sudden onset of NEC. These findings suggest that early life virome signatures in preterm infants may be implicated in NEC.

## Gut Microbiota of Wild Fish as Reporters of Compromised Aquatic Environments Sleuthed through Machine Learning.
 20.04.2022, _J Turner, X Cheng, N Saferin, JY Yeo, T Yang, B Joe_


Human-generated negative impacts on aquatic environments are rising. Despite wild fish playing a key role in aquatic ecologies and comprising a major global food source, physiological consequences of these impacts to them are poorly understood. Here we address the issue through the lens of interrelationship between wild fish and their gut microbiota, hypothesizing that fish microbiota are reporters of the aquatic environs. Two geographically separate teleost wild-fish species were studied (Lake Erie, Ohio and Caribbean Sea, US Virgin Islands). At each geo-location, fresh fecal samples were collected from fish in areas of presence or absence of known aquatic compromise. Gut microbiota was assessed via microbial 16S-rRNA gene sequencing and represents the first complete report for both fish species. Despite marked differences in geography, climate, water type, fish species, habitat, diet and gut microbial compositions, the pattern of shifts in microbiota shared by both fish species was nearly identical due to aquatic compromise. Next, these data were subjected to Machine Learning (ML) to examine reliability for using the fish-gut microbiota as an eco-marker for anthropogenic aquatic impacts. Independent of geo-location, ML predicted aquatic compromise with remarkable accuracy (&gt;90%). Overall, this study represents the first multi-species stress-related comparison of its kind and demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence via ML as a tool for bio-monitoring and detecting compromised aquatic conditions.

## Microbiome and related structural features of Earth's most archaic plant indicate early plant symbiosis attributes.
 24.04.2022, _A Satjarak, GK Golinski, MT Trest, LE Graham_


_Bryophyta, Embryophyta, Humans, Microbiota, Mycorrhizae, Phylogeny, Plants, Symbiosis_
Origin of earliest land plants from ancestral algae dramatically accelerated the evolution of Earth's terrestrial ecosystems, in which microbial symbioses have played key roles. Recent molecular diversification analyses identify the rare, geographically-limited moss Takakia as Earth's most archaic modern land plant. Despite occupying a phylogenetic position pivotal for understanding earliest plants, Takakia microbial associations are poorly known. Here, we describe symbiosis-related structural features and contig-based metagenomic data that illuminate the evolutionary transition from streptophyte algae to early embryophytes. We observed that T. lepidozioides shares with streptophyte algae secretion of microbe-harboring mucilage and bacterial taxa such as Rhizobium and genes indicating nitrogen fixation. We find that Takakia root-analogs produce lateral mucilage organs that are more complex than generally understood, having structural analogies to angiosperm lateral roots adapted for N-fixation symbioses, including presence of intracellular microbes. We also find structural and metagenomic evidence for mycorrhiza-like species of glomalean fungi (including Rhizophagus irregularis) not previously known for mosses, as well as ascomycete fungi (e.g. Rhizoscyphus ericae) that associate with other early-diverging plants. Because Takakia is the oldest known modern plant genus, this study of plants of a remote locale not strongly influenced by human activities may indicate microbiome features of early land plants.

## Synthetic bacterial community derived from a desert rhizosphere confers salt stress resilience to tomato in the presence of a soil microbiome.
 22.04.2022, _L Schmitz, Z Yan, M Schneijderberg, M de Roij, R Pijnenburg, Q Zheng, C Franken, A Dechesne, LM Trindade, R van Velzen, T Bisseling, R Geurts, X Cheng_


The root bacterial microbiome is important for the general health of the plant. Additionally, it can enhance tolerance to abiotic stresses, exemplified by plant species found in extreme ecological niches like deserts. These complex microbe-plant interactions can be simplified by constructing synthetic bacterial communities or SynComs from the root microbiome. Furthermore, SynComs can be applied as biocontrol agents to protect crops against abiotic stresses such as high salinity. However, there is little knowledge on the design of a SynCom that offers a consistent protection against salt stress for plants growing in a natural and, therefore, non-sterile soil which is more realistic to an agricultural setting. Here we show that a SynCom of five bacterial strains, originating from the root of the desert plant Indigofera argentea, protected tomato plants growing in a non-sterile substrate against a high salt stress. This phenotype correlated with the differential expression of salt stress related genes and ion accumulation in tomato. Quantification of the SynCom strains indicated a low penetrance into the natural soil used as the non-sterile substrate. Our results demonstrate how a desert microbiome could be engineered into a simplified SynCom that protected tomato plants growing in a natural soil against an abiotic stress.

## Chemotaxis shapes the microscale organization of the ocean's microbiome.

The capacity of planktonic marine microorganisms to actively seek out and exploit microscale chemical hotspots has been widely theorized to affect ocean-basin scale biogeochemistry1-3, but has never been examined comprehensively in situ among natural microbial communities. Here, using a field-based microfluidic platform to quantify the behavioural responses of marine bacteria and archaea, we observed significant levels of chemotaxis towards microscale hotspots of phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) at a coastal field site across multiple deployments, spanning several months. Microscale metagenomics revealed that a wide diversity of marine prokaryotes, spanning 27 bacterial and 2 archaeal phyla, displayed chemotaxis towards microscale patches of DOM derived from ten globally distributed phytoplankton species. The distinct DOM composition of each phytoplankton species attracted phylogenetically and functionally discrete populations of bacteria and archaea, with 54% of chemotactic prokaryotes displaying highly specific responses to the DOM derived from only one or two phytoplankton species. Prokaryotes exhibiting chemotaxis towards phytoplankton-derived compounds were significantly enriched in the capacity to transport and metabolize specific phytoplankton-derived chemicals, and displayed enrichment in functions conducive to symbiotic relationships, including genes involved in the production of siderophores, B vitamins and growth-promoting hormones. Our findings demonstrate that the swimming behaviour of natural prokaryotic assemblages is governed by specific chemical cues, which dictate important biogeochemical transformation processes and the establishment of ecological interactions that structure the base of the marine food web.

_Biodiversity, Biofilms, Ecosystem, Ice Cover, Microbiota, Rivers_
In glacier-fed streams, ecological windows of opportunity allow complex microbial biofilms to develop and transiently form the basis of the food web, thereby controlling key ecosystem processes. Using metagenome-assembled genomes, we unravel strategies that allow biofilms to seize this opportunity in an ecosystem otherwise characterized by harsh environmental conditions. We observe a diverse microbiome spanning the entire tree of life including a rich virome. Various co-existing energy acquisition pathways point to diverse niches and the exploitation of available resources, likely fostering the establishment of complex biofilms during windows of opportunity. The wide occurrence of rhodopsins, besides chlorophyll, highlights the role of solar energy capture in these biofilms while internal carbon and nutrient cycling between photoautotrophs and heterotrophs may help overcome constraints imposed by oligotrophy in these habitats. Mechanisms potentially protecting bacteria against low temperatures and high UV-radiation are also revealed and the selective pressure of this environment is further highlighted by a phylogenomic analysis differentiating important components of the glacier-fed stream microbiome from other ecosystems. Our findings reveal key genomic underpinnings of adaptive traits contributing to the success of complex biofilms to exploit environmental opportunities in glacier-fed streams, which are now rapidly changing owing to global warming.

## Host phenotype classification from human microbiome data is mainly driven by the presence of microbial taxa.
 21.04.2022, _R Giliberti, S Cavaliere, IE Mauriello, D Ercolini, E Pasolli_


Machine learning-based classification approaches are widely used to predict host phenotypes from microbiome data. Classifiers are typically employed by considering operational taxonomic units or relative abundance profiles as input features. Such types of data are intrinsically sparse, which opens the opportunity to make predictions from the presence/absence rather than the relative abundance of microbial taxa. This also poses the question whether it is the presence rather than the abundance of particular taxa to be relevant for discrimination purposes, an aspect that has been so far overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by performing a meta-analysis on 4,128 publicly available metagenomes associated with multiple case-control studies. At species-level taxonomic resolution, we show that it is the presence rather than the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa to be important when building classification models. Such findings are robust to the choice of the classifier and confirmed by statistical tests applied to identifying differentially abundant/present taxa. Results are further confirmed at coarser taxonomic resolutions and validated on 4,026 additional 16S rRNA samples coming from 30 public case-control studies.

## Metagenomic signatures of balancing selection in the human gut.
 21.04.2022, _AH Moeller_


Bacterial lineages that populate the human gut microbiota contend with spatial and temporal fluctuations in numerous environmental variables, including bouts of extreme selective agents like antibiotics. Oscillations in the adaptive landscape can impose balancing selection on populations, leaving characteristic signatures in the sequence variation of functionally significant genomic loci. Despite their potential importance for gut bacterial adaptation, the metagenomic targets of balancing selection have not been identified. Here, I present population genetic evidence that balancing selection maintains allelic diversity in multidrug efflux pumps of multiple predominant gut bacterial species. Metagenome-wide scans of 566,958 genes from 287 bacterial species represented by 118,617 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) indicated that most genes have been conserved by purifying selection. However, dozens of core open reading frames (CORFs) displayed positive Tajima's D values that deviated significantly from their species' genomic backgrounds, indicating the action of balancing selection. Multidrug efflux pumps (MEPs) from a diversity of bacterial species were significantly enriched among the CORFs with Tajima's D values &gt;3 in industrialized, but not non-industrialized, human populations. The AcrB subunit of a MEP from Bacteroides dorei displayed the highest Tajima's D of any CORF. Divergent haplotypes of this CORF displayed evidence of positive selection (dN&gt;dS) and homology to an E. coli AcrB subunit that binds tetracycline and macrolide antibiotics, suggesting functional significance and implicating medical antibiotics as an agent of selection acting on this locus. Other proteins identified as targets of balancing selection included peptidoglycan/LPS O-acetylases and ion transporters. Intriguingly, the degree of balancing selection acting on gut bacterial species was associated with species abundance in the gut based on metagenomic data, further suggesting fitness benefits of the allelic variation identified.

## Method for absolute quantification of short chain fatty acids via reverse phase chromatography mass spectrometry.
 23.04.2022, _DG Bihan, T Rydzak, M Wyss, K Pittman, KD McCoy, IA Lewis_

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs; including acetate, propionate, and butyrate) are an important class of biological molecules that play a major role in modulating host-microbiome interactions. Despite significant research into SCFA-mediated biological mechanisms, absolute quantification of these molecules in their native form by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is challenging due to their relatively poor chromatographic properties. Herein, we introduce SQUAD, an isotope-based strategy for absolute quantification of SCFAs in complex biological samples. SQUAD uses aniline derivatization in conjunction with isotope dilution and analysis by reverse-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. We show that SQUAD enables absolute quantification of biologically relevant SCFAs in complex biological samples with a lower limit of detection of 40 nM and a lower limit of quantification ranging from 160 nM to 310 nM. We observed an intra- and inter-day precision under 3% (relative standard deviation) and errors in intra- and inter-day accuracy under 10%. To demonstrate this quantification strategy, we analyzed SCFAs in the caecal contents of germ free versus conventionally raised specific pathogen free (SPF) mice. We showed that acetate was the most abundant SCFA in both types of mice and was present at 200-fold higher concentration in the SPF mice. We also illustrated the use of our quantification strategy in in vitro microbial cultures from five different species of bacteria grown in Mueller Hinton media. This study illustrates the diverse SCFA production rates across microbial taxa with acetate production serving as one of the key differentiating factors across the species. In summary, we introduce an isotope dilution strategy for absolute quantification of aniline-dativized SCFAs and illustrate the utility of this approach for microbiome research.
