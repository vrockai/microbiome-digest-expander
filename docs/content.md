## Impact of Microbiota: A Paradigm for Evolving Herd Immunity against Viral Diseases.
 16.10.2020, _A Shelly, P Gupta, R Ahuja, S Srichandan, J Meena, T Majumdar_


Herd immunity is the most critical and essential prophylactic intervention that delivers protection against infectious diseases at both the individual and community level. This process of natural vaccination is immensely pertinent to the current context of a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection around the globe. The conventional idea of herd immunity is based on efficient transmission of pathogens and developing natural immunity within a population. This is entirely encouraging while fighting against any disease in pandemic circumstances. A spatial community is occupied by people having variable resistance capacity against a pathogen. Protection efficacy against once very common diseases like smallpox, poliovirus or measles has been possible only because of either natural vaccination through contagious infections or expanded immunization programs among communities. This has led to achieving herd immunity in some cohorts. The microbiome plays an essential role in developing the body's immune cells for the emerging competent vaccination process, ensuring herd immunity. Frequency of interaction among microbiota, metabolic nutrients and individual immunity preserve the degree of vaccine effectiveness against several pathogens. Microbiome symbiosis regulates pathogen transmissibility and the success of vaccination among different age groups. Imbalance of nutrients perturbs microbiota and abrogates immunity. Thus, a particular population can become vulnerable to the infection. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to environmental enteropathy (EE). As a consequence, the generation of herd immunity can either be delayed or not start in a particular cohort. Moreover, disparities of the protective response of many vaccines in developing countries outside of developed countries are due to inconsistencies of healthy microbiota among the individuals. We suggested that pan-India poliovirus vaccination program, capable of inducing herd immunity among communities for the last 30 years, may also influence the inception of natural course of heterologous immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, this anamnestic recall is somewhat counterintuitive, as antibody generation against original antigens of SARS-CoV-2 will be subdued due to original antigenic sin.

## Human oral microbiome dysbiosis as a novel non-invasive biomarker in detection of colorectal cancer.
 15.10.2020, _S Zhang, C Kong, Y Yang, S Cai, X Li, G Cai, Y Ma_


Background: The oral microbiome may play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. However, few studies have investigated the association between oral microbiome and the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed to investigate whether oral health-colorectal tumor association has an underlying microbial basis, in the quest for novel non-invasive biomarkers for CRC. Methods: We collected oral swab samples from 161 patients with CRC, 34 patients with colorectal adenoma (CRA), and 58 healthy volunteers. The oral microbiota was assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. We characterized oral microbiome, identified microbial markers, constructed and validated colorectal tumor (CRA and CRC) classifier. Results: Oral microbial composition and diversity were significantly different among the three groups, and the CRA group had the highest diversity. Analysis of the functional potential of oral microbiota demonstrated that the pathway involving cell motility was overrepresented in the CRA and CRC groups relative to that in the healthy controls. Moreover, a random forest model was constructed based on oral microbial markers, which could distinguish the colorectal tumor groups from the healthy controls and achieve a powerful classification potential in the discovery and validation cohorts. Conclusion: This study suggests a potential association between oral microbiome dysbiosis and colorectal cancer. Oral microbiota-based biomarkers may be helpful in predicting the risks for the development of CRA and CRC.

## Microbiota Effects on Carcinogenesis: Initiation, Promotion and Progression.
 14.10.2020, _LR Lopez, RM Bleich, JC Arthur_


Carcinogenesis is a multistep process by which normal cells acquire genetic and epigenetic changes that result in cancer. In combination with host genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures, a prominent procarcinogenic role for the microbiota has recently emerged. In colorectal cancer (CRC), three nefarious microbes have been consistently linked to cancer development: (a) Colibactin-producing Escherichia coli initiates carcinogenic DNA damage, (b) enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis promotes tumorigenesis via toxin-induced cell proliferation and tumor-promoting inflammation, and (c) Fusobacterium nucleatum enhances CRC progression through two adhesins, Fap2 and FadA, that promote proliferation and antitumor immune evasion and may contribute to metastases. Herein, we use these three prominent microbes to discuss the experimental evidence linking microbial activities to carcinogenesis and the specific mechanisms driving this stepwise process. Precisely defining mechanisms by which the microbiota impacts carcinogenesis at each stage is essential for developing microbiota-targeted strategies for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Medicine, Volume 72 is January 27, 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

## Emerging role of bacterial extracellular vesicles in cancer.
 20.10.2020, _A Chronopoulos, R Kalluri_


Shedding of microbial extracellular vesicles constitutes a universal mechanism for inter-kingdom and intra-kingdom communication that is conserved among prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes. In this review we delineate fundamental aspects of bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) including their biogenesis, cargo composition, and interactions with host cells. We critically examine the evidence that BEVs from the host gut microbiome can enter the circulatory system to disseminate to distant organs and tissues. The potential involvement of BEVs in carcinogenesis is evaluated and future research ideas explored. We further discuss the potential of BEVs in microbiome-based liquid biopsies for cancer diagnostics and bioengineering strategies for cancer therapy.

## S100A8 and S100A9 are Important for Postnatal Development of Gut Microbiota and Immune System in Mice and Infants.
 17.08.2020, _M Willers, T Ulas, L Völlger, T Vogl, AS Heinemann, S Pirr, J Pagel, B Fehlhaber, O Halle, J Schöning, S Schreek, U Löber, M Essex, P Hombach, S Graspeuntner, M Basic, A Bleich, K Cloppenborg-Schmidt, S Künzel, D Jonigk, J Rupp, G Hansen, R Förster, JF Baines, C Härtel, JL Schultze, SK Forslund, J Roth, D Viemann_


After birth, the immune system matures via interactions with microbes in the gut. The S100 calcium binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9, and their extracellular complex form, S100A8-A9, are found in high amounts in human breast milk. We studied levels of S100A8-A9 in fecal samples (also called fecal calprotectin) from newborns and during infancy, and their effects on development of the intestinal microbiota and mucosal immune system.background METHODS: We collected stool samples (n=517) from full-term (n=72) and preterm infants (n=49) at different timepoints over the first year of life (days 1, 3, 10, 30, 90, 180, and 360). We measured levels of S100A8-A9 by ELISA and analyzed fecal microbiomes by 16S sRNA gene sequencing. We also obtained small and large intestine biopsies from 8 adults and 10 newborn infants without inflammatory bowel diseases (controls) and 8 infants with necrotizing enterocolitis and measured levels of S100A8 by immunofluorescence microscopy. Children were followed for 2.5 years and anthropometric data and medical information on infections were collected. We performed studies with newborn C57BL/6J wild-type and S100a9-/- mice (which also lack S100A8). Some mice were fed or given intraperitoneal injections of S100A8 or subcutaneous injections of Staphylococcus aureus. Blood and intestine, mesenterial and celiac lymph nodes were collected; cells and cytokines were measured by flow cytometry and studied in cell culture assays. Colon contents from mice were analyzed by culture-based microbiology assays.

_Cesarean Section, Feces, Female, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Male, Mexico, Obesity, Risk Factors_
Delivery methods during childbirth and their related gut microbiota profiles have important impacts on health later in life, they can contribute to the development of diseases such as obesity, whose highest prevalence rate is found among the Mexican child population. Coincidentally, Mexico has one of the highest global average annual rate increase in cesarean births (C-section). Since Mexico leads the world in childhood obesity, studying the relationship between childbirth delivery methods and gut microbiota profiles in this vulnerable population may be used to identify early risk factors for obesity in other developed and developing countries. The objective of this study is to determine the association between child delivery method and gut microbiota profiles in healthy Mexican newborns.Fecal samples of 57 term infants who participated in a randomized clinical trial in 2013 to study the safety of Agave fructans in newborns, were used in this study. DNA samples were extracted and used to characterize the microbiota composition using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The samples were further divided based on childbirth delivery method, as well as early diet. Gut microbiota profiles were determined and analyzed using cluster analysis followed by multiple correspondence analysis.An unusual high abundance of Proteobacteria was found in the gut microbiota of all Mexican infants studied, regardless of delivery method. Feces from infants born by C-section had low levels of Bacteroidetes, high levels of Firmicutes, especially Clostridium and Enterococcus, and a strikingly high ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F:B). Profiles enriched in Bacteroidetes and low F:B ratios, were strongly associated with vaginal delivery.The profile of gut microbiota associated with feces from Mexican infants born by C-section, may be added to the list of boosting factors for the worrying obesity epidemic in Mexico.

## Gut microbiome stability and resilience: elucidating the response to perturbations in order to modulate gut health.
 14.10.2020, _M Fassarella, EE Blaak, J Penders, A Nauta, H Smidt, EG Zoetendal_


The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem, densely colonised by thousands of microbial species. It varies among individuals and depends on host genotype and environmental factors, such as diet and antibiotics. In this review, we focus on stability and resilience as essential ecological characteristics of the gut microbiome and its relevance for human health. Microbial diversity, metabolic flexibility, functional redundancy, microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions seem to be critical for maintaining resilience. The equilibrium of the gut ecosystem can be disrupted by perturbations, such as antibiotic therapy, causing significant decreases in functional richness and microbial diversity as well as impacting metabolic health. As a consequence, unbalanced states or even unhealthy stable states can develop, potentially leading to or supporting diseases. Accordingly, strategies have been developed to manipulate the gut microbiome in order to prevent or revert unhealthy states caused by perturbations, including faecal microbiota transplantation, supplementation with probiotics or non-digestible carbohydrates, and more extensive dietary modifications. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies has evidenced interindividual variability in extent and direction of response to diet and perturbations, which has been attributed to the unique characteristics of each individual's microbiome. From a clinical, translational perspective, the ability to improve resilience of the gut microbial ecosystem prior to perturbations, or to restore its equilibrium afterwards, would offer significant benefits. To be effective, this therapeutic approach will likely need a personalised or subgroup-based understanding of individual genetics, diet, gut microbiome and other environmental factors that might be involved.

## Dietary nutrients shape gut microbes and intestinal mucosa via epigenetic modifications.
 12.10.2020, _J Wu, Y Zhao, X Wang, L Kong, LJ Johnston, L Lu, X Ma_


The imbalance of intestinal microecology firstly impairs intestinal mucosa barrier and function, then further damages the functions and homeostasis of distal organs, leading to systemic diseases. Nutrients, transplantation of bacteria flora and modes of life can shape gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa barrier and mitigate stress. Current researches demonstrate that dynamic epigenetic modifications of intestinal tissue strongly mediate the crosstalk between gut microbes and gut mucosa barrier. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species can synthesize folate to increase DNA methylation and mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) of gut, which ensures intestinal normal development. Clostridial cluster, Anaerostipes and Eubacterium can induce histone acylation modifications by butyrate to enhance the development and immune balance of gut. Herein, we summarizes the present scientific understanding of how dietary nutrients shape gut microbiota and further regulate intestinal mucosa functions via epigenetic modifications, which will shed light on manipulation of gut microbiota by dietary nutrients, for prevention or clinical treatment of intestinal diseases.

## Integrated phosphoproteomic and metabolomic profiling reveals perturbed pathways in the hippocampus of gut microbiota dysbiosis mice.
 14.10.2020, _H Wang, L Liu, X Rao, B Zeng, Y Yu, C Zhou, L Zeng, P Zheng, J Pu, S Xu, K Cheng, H Zhang, P Ji, H Wei, P Xie_


The dysbiosis of gut microbiota is an important environmental factor that can induce mental disorders, such as depression, through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are complex and not completely understood. Here we utilized mass spectrometry to identify the global phosphorylation dynamics in hippocampus tissue in germ-free mice and specific pathogen-free mice (GF vs SPF), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) model ("depression microbiota" and the "healthy microbiota" recipient mice). As a result, 327 phosphosites of 237 proteins in GF vs SPF, and 478 phosphosites of 334 proteins in "depression microbiota" vs "healthy microbiota" recipient mice were identified as significant. These phosphorylation dysregulations were consistently associated with glutamatergic neurotransmitter system disturbances. The FMT mice exhibited disturbances in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism in both the periphery and brain through integrating phosphoproteomic and metabolomic analysis. Moreover, CAMKII-CREB signaling pathway, in response to these disturbances, was the primary common perturbed cellular process. In addition, we demonstrated that the spliceosome, never directly implicated in mental disorders previously, was a substantially neuronal function disrupted by gut microbiota dysbiosis, and the NCBP1 phosphorylation was identified as a novel pathogenic target. These results present a new perspective to study the pathologic mechanisms of gut microbiota dysbiosis related depression and highlight potential gut-mediated therapies for depression.

## Microbial communities associated with the camel tick, Hyalomma dromedarii: 16S rRNA gene-based analysis.
 20.10.2020, _N Perveen, SB Muzaffar, R Vijayan, MA Al-Deeb_


Hyalomma dromedarii is an important blood-feeding ectoparasite that affects the health of camels. We assessed the profile of bacterial communities associated with H. dromedarii collected from camels in the eastern part of the UAE in 2010 and 2019. A total of 100 partially engorged female ticks were taken from tick samples collected from camels (n = 100; 50/year) and subjected to DNA extraction and sequencing. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform to elucidate the bacterial communities. Principle Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) was conducted to determine patterns of diversity in bacterial communities. In 2010 and 2019, we obtained 899,574 and 781,452 read counts and these formed 371 and 191 operational taxonomic units (OTUs, clustered at 97% similarity), respectively. In both years, twenty-five bacterial families with high relative abundance were detected and the following were the most common: Moraxellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, Bacillaceae, Corynebacteriaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Francisellaceae, Muribaculaceae, Neisseriaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae. Francisellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae coexist in H. dromedarii and we suggest that they thrive under similar conditions and microbial interactions inside the host. Comparisons of diversity indicated that microbial communities differed in terms of richness and evenness between 2010 and 2019, with higher richness but lower evenness in communities in 2010. Principle coordinates analyses showed clear clusters separating microbial communities in 2010 and 2019. The differences in communities suggested that the repertoire of microbial communities have shifted. In particular, the significant increase in dominance of Francisella and the presence of bacterial families containing pathogenic genera shows that H. dromedarii poses a serious health risk to camels and people who interact with them. Thus, it may be wise to introduce active surveillance of key genera that constitute a health hazard in the livestock industry to protect livestock and people.

## Pinewood Nematode Alters the Endophytic and Rhizospheric Microbial Communities of Pinus massoniana.
 14.10.2020, _W Zhang, X Wang, Y Li, Z Liu, D Li, X Wen, Y Feng, X Zhang_


Pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is one of the greatest threats to pine trees and is spreading all over the world. During the nematode's pathogenesis, plant microorganisms play important roles. However, many microbial communities, such as that in Pinus massoniana, a major host of B. xylophilus that is widely distributed in China, are not well studied, especially the fungal communities. Here, the endophytic and rhizospheric bacterial and fungal communities associated with healthy and B. xylophilus-infected P. massoniana were analyzed. The results showed that 7639 bacterial and 3108 fungal OTUs were annotated from samples of P. massoniana, the rhizosphere, and B. xylophilus. There were significant diversity differences of endophytic microbes between healthy and infected P. massoniana. The abundances of endophytic bacteria Paenibacillus, unidentified_Burkholderiaceae, Serratia, Erwinia, and Pseudoxanthomonas and fungi Penicillifer, Zygoascus, Kirschsteiniothelia, Cyberlindnera, and Sporothrix in infected pines were greater than those in healthy pines, suggesting an association of particular microbial abundances with the pathogenesis of B. xylophilus in pines. Meanwhile, the abundances of microbes of unidentified_Burkholderiaceae, Saitozyma, and Pestalotiopsis were greater and Acidothermus and Trichoderma were lower in the rhizosphere under infected pines than those under healthy pines and the differences might be caused by B. xylophilus-induced weakening of the health of pines. Our study explored the endophytic and rhizospheric microbial community changes potentially caused by B. xylophilus infection of pines.
