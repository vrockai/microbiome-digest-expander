## Host-microbiome protein-protein interactions capture disease-relevant pathways.
 05.03.2022, _H Zhou, JF Beltrán, IL Brito_


Host-microbe interactions are crucial for normal physiological and immune system development and are implicated in a variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite large-scale case-control studies aimed at identifying microbial taxa or genes involved in pathogeneses, the mechanisms linking them to disease have thus far remained elusive.

## tRNA modification dynamics from individual organisms to metaepitranscriptomics of microbiomes.
 05.03.2022, _W Zhang, M Foo, AM Eren, T Pan_


tRNA is the most extensively modified RNA in cells. On average, a bacterial tRNA contains 8 modifications per molecule and a eukaryotic tRNA contains 13 modifications per molecule. Recent studies reveal that tRNA modifications are highly dynamic and respond extensively to environmental conditions. Functions of tRNA modification dynamics include enhanced, on-demand decoding of specific codons in response genes and regulation of tRNA fragment biogenesis. This review summarizes recent advances in the studies of tRNA modification dynamics in biological processes, tRNA modification erasers, and human-associated bacteria. Furthermore, we use the term "metaepitranscriptomics" to describe the potential and approach of tRNA modification studies in natural biological communities such as microbiomes. tRNA is highly modified in cells, and tRNA modifications respond extensively to environmental conditions to enhance translation of specific genes and produce tRNA fragments on demand. We review recent advances in tRNA sequencing methods, tRNA modification dynamics in biological processes, and tRNA modification studies in natural communities such as the microbiomes.

## Socioeconomic disparities and household crowding in association with the fecal microbiome of school-age children.
 04.03.2022, _Y Lapidot, L Reshef, M Maya, D Cohen, U Gophna, K Muhsen_


The development of the gut microbiome occurs mainly during the first years of life; however, little is known on the role of environmental and socioeconomic exposures, particularly within the household, in shaping the microbial ecology through childhood. We characterized differences in the gut microbiome of school-age healthy children, in association with socioeconomic disparities and household crowding. Stool samples were analyzed from 176 Israeli Arab children aged six to nine years from three villages of different socioeconomic status (SES). Sociodemographic data were collected through interviews with the mothers. We used 16 S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the gut microbiome, including an inferred analysis of metabolic pathways. Differential analysis was performed using the analysis of the composition of microbiomes (ANCOM), with adjustment for covariates. An analysis of inferred metagenome functions was performed implementing PICRUSt2. Gut microbiome composition differed across the villages, with the largest difference attributed to socioeconomic disparities, with household crowding index being a significant explanatory variable. Living in a low SES village and high household crowding were associated with increased bacterial richness and compositional differences, including an over-representation of Prevotella copri and depleted Bifidobacterium. Secondary bile acid synthesis, d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism and Biotin metabolism were decreased in the lower SES village. In summary, residential SES is a strong determinant of the gut microbiome in healthy school-age children, mediated by household crowding and characterized by increased bacterial richness and substantial taxonomic and metabolic differences. Further research is necessary to explore possible implications of SES-related microbiome differences on children's health and development.

## Helicobacter pylori infection affects the human gastric microbiome, as revealed by metagenomic sequencing.
 04.03.2022, _D Wang, T Zhang, Y Lu, C Wang, Y Wu, J Li, Y Tao, L Deng, X Zhang, J Ma_


Helicobacter pylori infection is a prevalent infectious disease, associated with many gastric diseases, including gastritis, gastric ulcer, and gastric cancer. To reveal the characteristics of the gastric microbiome in patients infected with H. pylori, we performed metagenomic shotgun sequencing of stomach swab samples from 96 patients, and then conducted metagenomic association analyses between alterations of the gastric microbiome and H. pylori infection status. The overall composition of the gastric microbiota in H. pylori-infected individuals was distinctly different from the negative controls; H. pylori became the dominant species after colonizing the human stomach, and significantly decreased the α-diversity of the gastric community (P&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). We also identified 6 HPI-associated microbial species (FDR &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test): Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Stenotrophomonas unclassified, Chryseobacterium unclassified, Pedobacter unclassified, Variovorax unclassified, and Pseudomonas stutzeri. Furthermore, 55 gastric microbial pathways were enriched in the H. pylori-positive group, whereas only 2 pathways were more abundant in the H. pylori-negative group: dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthesis and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. (FDR&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Gastritis was not associated with non-H. pylori species in the stomach (P&gt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This study revealed alterations of gastric microbial taxa and function associated with HPI in the Chinese population, which provides an insight into gastric microbial interactions and their potential role in the pathological process of gastric diseases.

## Direct and indirect mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influence host serotonin systems.
 05.03.2022, _TB Legan, B Lavoie, GM Mawe_


Mounting evidence highlights the pivotal role of enteric microbes as a dynamic interface with the host. Indeed, the gut microbiota, located in the lumen of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, influence many essential physiological processes that are evident in both healthy and pathological states. A key signaling molecule throughout the body is serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), which acts in the GI tract to regulate numerous gut functions including intestinal motility and secretion. The gut microbiota can modulate host 5-HT systems both directly and indirectly. Direct actions of gut microbes, evidenced by studies using germ-free animals or antibiotic administration, alter the expression of key 5-HT-related genes to promote 5-HT biosynthesis. Indirectly, the gut microbiota produce numerous microbial metabolites, whose actions can influence host serotonergic systems in a variety of ways. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding mechanisms by which gut bacteria act to regulate host 5-HT and 5-HT-mediated gut functions, as well as implications for 5-HT in the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Gut microbiomics is based on analysis of both live and dead cells in the stool. However, to understand the ecology of gut microbiota and their symbiotic relationships with hosts, spatial distribution of live bacteria must be examined. Here, we analyzed the live composition of luminal microbiota (LM) and mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM) in the ascending and descending colons and the rectums of 10 healthy adults and compared it with the total composition. The abundance of Lachnospiraceae in live LM decreased along the gut length and was significantly lower than that in total LM. Contrastingly, the abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae in live LM was higher than that in total LM, suggesting differences in death rate during gut migration. Live Enterobacteriaceae levels in MAM were significantly higher in rectum than in the ascending and descending colons and in LM. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of luminal bile acids revealed that 7α-dehydroxylation occurred towards the rectum. In live LM where a bile acid-inducible gene could be detected, 7α-dehydroxylation rates were higher than those in the group without the gene. Overall, we showed differences in live bacteria composition among three gut sites and between LM and MAM, highlighting the importance of understanding their spatial distribution.

## Understanding the mechanism underlying the anti-diabetic effect of dietary component: a focus on gut microbiota.
 04.03.2022, _Y Zhao, M Li, Y Wang, R Geng, J Fang, Q Liu, SG Kang, WC Zeng, K Huang, T Tong_


Diabetes has become one of the biggest non-communicable diseases and threatens human health worldwide. The management of diabetes is a complex and multifaceted process including drug therapy and lifestyle interventions. Dietary components are essential for both diabetes management and health and survival of trillions of the gut microbiota (GM). Herein, we will discuss the relationship between diets and GM, the mechanism linking diabetes and gut dysbiosis, and the effects of dietary components (nutrients, phytochemicals, probiotics, food additives, etc.) on diabetes from the perspective of modulating GM. The GM of diabetic patients differs from that of health individuals and GM disorder contributes to the onset and maintenance of diabetes. Studies in humans and animal models consolidate that dietary component is a key regulator of diabetes and increasing evidence suggests that the alteration of GM plays a salient role in dietary interventions for diabetes. Given that diabetes is a major public health issue, especially that diabetes is linked with a high risk of mortality from COVID-19, this review provides compelling evidence for that targeting GM by dietary components is a promising strategy, and offers new insights into potential preventive or therapeutic approaches (dietary and pharmacological intervention) for the clinical management of diabetes.

## Intestinal AMPK modulation of microbiota mediates crosstalk with brown fat to control thermogenesis.
 04.03.2022, _E Zhang, L Jin, Y Wang, J Tu, R Zheng, L Ding, Z Fang, M Fan, I Al-Abdullah, R Natarajan, K Ma, Z Wang, AD Riggs, SC Shuck, L Yang, W Huang_


The energy-dissipating capacity of brown adipose tissue through thermogenesis can be targeted to improve energy balance. Mammalian 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, a key nutrient sensor for maintaining cellular energy status, is a known therapeutic target in Type II diabetes. Despite its well-established roles in regulating glucose metabolism in various tissues, the functions of AMPK in the intestine remain largely unexplored. Here we show that AMPKα1 deficiency in the intestine results in weight gain and impaired glucose tolerance under high fat diet feeding, while metformin administration fails to ameliorate these metabolic disorders in intestinal AMPKα1 knockout mice. Further, AMPKα1 in the intestine communicates with brown adipose tissue to promote thermogenesis. Mechanistically, we uncover a link between intestinal AMPKα1 activation and BAT thermogenic regulation through modulating anti-microbial peptide-controlled gut microbiota and the metabolites. Our findings identify AMPKα1-mediated mechanisms of intestine-BAT communication that may partially underlie the therapeutic effects of metformin.

## Impact of wheat aleurone on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease, gut microbiota and metabolites in adults with high body mass index: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.
 05.03.2022, _F Fava, MM Ulaszewska, M Scholz, J Stanstrup, L Nissen, F Mattivi, J Vermeiren, D Bosscher, C Pedrolli, KM Tuohy_


Aleurone is a cereal bran fraction containing a variety of beneficial nutrients including polyphenols, fibers, minerals and vitamins. Animal and human studies support the beneficial role of aleurone consumption in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Gut microbiota fiber fermentation, polyphenol metabolism and betaine/choline metabolism may in part contribute to the physiological effects of aleurone. As primary objective, this study evaluated whether wheat aleurone supplemented foods could modify plasma homocysteine. Secondary objectives included changes in CVD biomarkers, fecal microbiota composition and plasma/urine metabolite profiles.
