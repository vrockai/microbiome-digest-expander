_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Determination of Tr1 cell populations correlating with distinct activation states in acute IAV infection.
 15.06.2023, _CA Abbott, EL Freimayer, TS Tyllis, TS Norton, M Alsharifi, A H S Heng, SM Pederson, Z Qu, M Armstrong, GR Hill, SR McColl, I Comerford_


Type I regulatory (Tr1) cells are defined as FOXP3-IL-10-secreting CD4+ T cells that contribute to immune suppression and typically express the markers LAG-3 and CD49b and other co-inhibitory receptors. These cells have not been studied in detail the context of the resolution of acute infection in the lung. Here, we identify FOXP3-IL-10+ CD4+ T cells transiently accumulating in the lung parenchyma during resolution of the response to sublethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice. These cells were dependent on IL-27Rα, which was required for timely recovery from IAV-induced weight loss. LAG-3 and CD49b were not generally co-expressed by FOXP3- IL-10+ CD4+ T cells in this model and four populations of these cells based on LAG-3 and CD49b co-expression were apparent (LAG-3-CD49b- [DN], LAG-3+CD49b+ [DP], LAG-3+CD49b- [LAG-3+], LAG-3-CD49b+ [CD49b+]). However, each population exhibited suppressive potential consistent with the definition of Tr1 cells. Notably, differences between these populations of Tr1 cells were apparent including differential dependence on IL-10 to mediate suppression and expression of markers indicative of different activation states and terminal differentiation. Sort-transfer experiments indicated that LAG-3+ Tr1 cells exhibited the capacity to convert to DN and DP Tr1 cells, indicative of plasticity between these populations. Together, these data determine the features and suppressive potential of Tr1 cells in the resolution of IAV infection and identify four populations delineated by LAG-3 and CD49b, which likely correspond to different Tr1 cell activation states.

## Obesity: Policy and Practice Recommendations for High-Risk Populations Influenced by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
 22.12.2022, _KN Robinson, DA Saber_


_Humans, United States, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Pandemics, Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype, Obesity, Policy_
Obesity has been linked to higher morbidity and mortality in those that contract novel viruses, such as H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. Loss of life and the high cost of obesity highlight the need to focus on preventative measures. The state of Maine (United States) is profiled as a rural state with high rates of obesity and low health literacy that benefits from programs to improve health. However, more multidirectional efforts are needed. Four recommendations for building a healthier, more resilient patient population are discussed here: (i) state incentives and subsidies, (ii) employers to incentivize healthy living, (iii) federal incentives and initiatives, and (iv) personal responsibility for health and wellness.

## Guild and Niche Determination Enable Targeted Alteration of the Microbiome.
 30.05.2023, _O Moyne, M Al-Bassam, C Lieng, D Thiruppathy, GJ Norton, M Kumar, E Haddad, LS Zaramela, K Zengler_


Microbiome science has greatly contributed to our understanding of microbial life and its essential roles for the environment and human health 1-5 . However, the nature of microbial interactions and how microbial communities respond to perturbations remains poorly understood, resulting in an often descriptive and correlation-based approach to microbiome research 6-8 . Achieving causal and predictive microbiome science would require direct functional measurements in complex communities to better understand the metabolic role of each member and its interactions with others. In this study we present a new approach that integrates transcription and translation measurements to predict competition and substrate preferences within microbial communities, consequently enabling the selective manipulation of the microbiome. By performing metatranscriptomic (metaRNA-Seq) and metatranslatomic (metaRibo-Seq) analysis in complex samples, we classified microbes into functional groups (i.e. guilds) and demonstrated that members of the same guild are competitors. Furthermore, we predicted preferred substrates based on importer proteins, which specifically benefited selected microbes in the community (i.e. their niche) and simultaneously impaired their competitors. We demonstrated the scalability of microbial guild and niche determination to natural samples and its ability to successfully manipulate microorganisms in complex microbiomes. Thus, the approach enhances the design of pre- and probiotic interventions to selectively alter members within microbial communities, advances our understanding of microbial interactions, and paves the way for establishing causality in microbiome science.

Currently, infertility affects 8-12% of reproductive age couples worldwide, a problem that also affects women suffering from recurrent implantation failure (RIF). RIF is a complex condition resulting from many physiological and molecular mechanisms involving dynamic endometrium-blastocyst interaction. The most important are the endometrial receptivity process, decidualization, trophoblast invasion, and blastocyst nesting. Although the exact multifactorial pathogenesis of RIF remains unclear, many studies have suggested the association between hormone level imbalance, disturbances of angiogenic and immunomodulatory factors, certain genetic polymorphisms, and occurrence of RIF. These studies were performed in quite small groups. Additionally, the results are inconsistent between ethnicities. The present review briefly summarizes the importance of factors involved in RIF development that could also serve as diagnostic determinants. Moreover, our review could constitute part of a new platform for discovery of novel diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for RIF.

_Humans, Adolescent, Bipolar Disorder, Mania, Quality of Life, Prospective Studies, Double-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic_
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and recurrent disorder characterized by biphasic mood episodes of mania or hypomania and depression. It affects more than 1% of the global population and is a leading cause of disability in young people. Currently available treatments for BD are still fairly limited in terms of efficacy, with high rates of non-adherence, non-response, and undesirable side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history and rich experience in stabilizing mania and improving quality of life. Aiming at rebalancing and in BD, therapy of replenishing and regulating (RYRY therapy) has been in clinical use for years in China. The present prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of RYRY therapy for bipolar mania and its possible mechanism from the point of regulating gut microbiota and anti-inflammation. A total of 60 eligible participants will be recruited from Beijing Anding Hospital. They will be randomized to either the study group or the control group in a ratio of 1∶1. Participants allocated to the study group will receive RYRY granule, while placebo granule will be applied in the control group. Participants in both groups will be prescribed conventional therapy for manic episode in BD. Four scheduled visits will be conducted over 4 weeks. Outcome measurements include Young Mania Rating Scale, TCM Symptom Pattern Rating Scale, Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale, levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α and the gut microbial community profile of stool samples. Safety outcomes and adverse events will also be recorded. In this study, we set a number of scientific and objective assessments to evaluate the efficacy of RYRY therapy and study into its possible mechanism, hopefully offering clinicians an alternative approach to BD.

## Methods for Analyzing the Gut Microbiota in Diabetic Retinopathy.
 16.06.2023, _Y Huang, JH Ma, Y Peng, X Yang, J Chen, S Tang_


The gut microbiome that inhabits human hosts plays an important role in the development of a healthy host immune system. Many studies have shown that gut microbiota is involved in the occurrence and development of diabetic retinopathy (DR). With the advent of sequencing technology of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, microbiota studies are becoming more feasible. Here, we described a study protocol to characterize the microbiota composite in the DR and non-DR patients compared with healthy controls.

## Outer membrane protein OMP76 of Riemerella anatipestifer contributes to complement evasion and virulence by binding to duck complement factor vitronectin.
 16.06.2023, _S Li, Y Wang, R Yang, X Zhu, H Bai, X Deng, J Bai, Y Zhang, Y Xiao, Z Li, Z Liu, Z Zhou_


Riemerella anatipestifer is an important bacterial pathogen in poultry. Pathogenic bacteria recruit host complement factors to resist the bactericidal effect of serum complement. Vitronectin (Vn) is a complementary regulatory protein that inhibits the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Microbes use outer membrane proteins (OMPs) to hijack Vn for complement evasion. However, the mechanism by which R. anatipestifer achieves evasion is unclear. This study aimed to characterise OMPs of R. anatipestifer which interact with duck Vn (dVn) during complement evasion. Far-western assays and comparison of wild-type and mutant strains that were treated with dVn and duck serum demonstrated particularly strong binding of OMP76 to dVn. These data were confirmed with Escherichia coli strains expressing and not expressing OMP76. Combining tertiary structure analysis and homology modelling, truncated and knocked-out fragments of OMP76 showed that a cluster of critical amino acids in an extracellular loop of OMP76 mediate the interaction with dVn. Moreover, binding of dVn to R. anatipestifer inhibited MAC deposition on the bacterial surface thereby enhancing survival in duck serum. Virulence of the mutant strain ΔOMP76 was attenuated significantly relative to the wild-type strain. Furthermore, adhesion and invasion abilities of ΔOMP76 decreased, and histopathological changes showed that ΔOMP76 was less virulent in ducklings. Thus, OMP76 is a key virulence factor of R. anatipestifer. The identification of OMP76-mediated evasion of complement by recruitment of dVn contributes significantly to the understanding of the molecular mechanism by which R. anatipestifer escapes host innate immunity and provides a new target for the development of subunit vaccines.

## Gut microbiota and cognitive development in infant mice: Quantity and source of potable water.
 16.06.2023, _CS Kim, DM Shin_


_Animals, Mice, Drinking Water, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Dehydration, Cognition, Cognitive Dysfunction, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes_
Not only the water quantity consumed but also the source of drinking water has been considered for their health benefits, but there is limited evidence. We aimed to determine whether the amount and type of drinking water affect physiological and biological functions, including brain function, by confirming how it affects gut microbiota which has an important regulatory role in host physiology. Three-week-old infant mice were subjected to 1) a water restriction experiment (control group, ad libitum consumption of distilled water; dehydration group, time-limited access to distilled water [15 min/day]) and 2) different water source experiment (distilled water, purified water, spring water, and tap water groups). The gut microbiota and cognitive development were analyzed using the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing method and the Barnes maze, respectively. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) changed depending on age (juveniles vs. infants). Insufficient water intake reversed these developmental changes, showing that the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the F/B ratio in dehydrated juvenile mice were similar to those in normal infant mice. Additionally, clustering analysis revealed no significant differences in the intestinal flora in the mice from the different drinking water sources; however, dehydration significantly altered the composition of the genera compared to the other water source groups wherein water was provided ad libitum. Moreover, cognitive development was significantly disrupted by insufficient water intake, although the type of drinking water had no significant influence. Cognitive decline, measured by relative latency, was positively associated with the relative abundance of unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae that were in significantly high relative abundance in the dehydration group. These results suggest that the water quantity consumed, rather than the mineral content of drinking water, is imperative for shaping the early gut microbiota associated with cognitive development during infancy.

## Globally consistent response of plant microbiome diversity across hosts and continents to soil nutrients and herbivores.

_Herbivory, Biomass, Microbiota, Nutrients, Soil_
All multicellular organisms host a diverse microbiome composed of microbial pathogens, mutualists, and commensals, and changes in microbiome diversity or composition can alter host fitness and function. Nonetheless, we lack a general understanding of the drivers of microbiome diversity, in part because it is regulated by concurrent processes spanning scales from global to local. Global-scale environmental gradients can determine variation in microbiome diversity among sites, however an individual host's microbiome also may reflect its local micro-environment. We fill this knowledge gap by experimentally manipulating two potential mediators of plant microbiome diversity (soil nutrient supply and herbivore density) at 23 grassland sites spanning global-scale gradients in soil nutrients, climate, and plant biomass. Here we show that leaf-scale microbiome diversity in unmanipulated plots depended on the total microbiome diversity at each site, which was highest at sites with high soil nutrients and plant biomass. We also found that experimentally adding soil nutrients and excluding herbivores produced concordant results across sites, increasing microbiome diversity by increasing plant biomass, which created a shaded microclimate. This demonstration of consistent responses of microbiome diversity across a wide range of host species and environmental conditions suggests the possibility of a general, predictive understanding of microbiome diversity.

## Leveraging Cell Painting Images to Expand the Applicability Domain and Actively Improve Deep Learning Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Models.
 16.06.2023, _D Herman, MM Kańduła, LGA Freitas, C van Dongen, T Le Van, N Mesens, S Jaensch, E Gustin, L Micholt, CH Lardeau, C Varsakelis, J Reumers, S Zoffmann, Y Will, PJ Peeters, H Ceulemans_


The search for chemical hit material is a lengthy and increasingly expensive drug discovery process. To improve it, ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship models have been broadly applied to optimize primary and secondary compound properties. Although these models can be deployed as early as the stage of molecule design, they have a limited applicability domain─if the structures of interest differ substantially from the chemical space on which the model was trained, a reliable prediction will not be possible. Image-informed ligand-based models partly solve this shortcoming by focusing on the phenotype of a cell caused by small molecules, rather than on their structure. While this enables chemical diversity expansion, it limits the application to compounds physically available and imaged. Here, we employ an active learning approach to capitalize on both of these methods' strengths and boost the model performance of a mitochondrial toxicity assay (Glu/Gal). Specifically, we used a phenotypic Cell Painting screen to build a chemistry-independent model and adopted the results as the main factor in selecting compounds for experimental testing. With the additional Glu/Gal annotation for selected compounds we were able to dramatically improve the chemistry-informed ligand-based model with respect to the increased recognition of compounds from a 10% broader chemical space.

## Metaproteomics Characterizes the Human Gingival Crevicular Fluid Microbiome Function in Periodontitis.
 16.06.2023, _X Xiao, X Xiao, Y Liu, H Sun, X Liu, Z Guo, Q Li, W Sun_


Periodontitis is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults worldwide. The human proteome and metaproteome characterization of periodontitis is not clearly understood. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from eight periodontitis and eight healthy subjects. Both the human and microbial proteins were characterized by liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. A total of 570 human proteins were found differentially expressed, which were primarily associated with inflammatory response, cell death, cellular junction, and fatty acid metabolism. For the metaproteome, 51 genera were identified, and 10 genera were found highly expressed in periodontitis, while 11 genera were downregulated. The analysis showed that microbial proteins related to butyrate metabolism were upregulated in periodontitis cases. In particular, correlation analysis showed that the expression of host proteins related to inflammatory response, cell death, cellular junction, and lipid metabolism correlates with the alteration of metaproteins, which reflect the changes of molecular function during the occurrence of periodontitis. This study showed that the gingival crevicular fluid human proteome and metaproteome could reflect the characteristics of periodontitis. This might benefit the understanding of the periodontitis mechanism.

## Shifts in flowering phenology in response to spring temperatures in eastern Tennessee.
 16.06.2023, _AS Faidiga, MG Oliver, JM Budke, S Kalisz_


Plant phenological shifts are among the clearest indicators of the effects of climate change. In North America, numerous studies in New England have demonstrated earlier spring flowering compared to historical records. However, few studies have examined phenological shifts in the southeastern United States, a highly biodiverse region of North America characterized by dramatic variation in abiotic conditions over small geographic areas.

## Dioxin emission modeling using feature selection and simplified DFR with residual error fitting for the grate-based MSWI process.
 16.06.2023, _H Xia, J Tang, L Aljerf, C Cui, B Gao, PO Ukaogo_


Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) with grate technology is a widely applied waste-to-energy process in various cities in China. Meanwhile, dioxins (DXN) are emitted at the stack and are the critical environmental indicator for operation optimization control in the MSWI process. However, constructing a high-precision and fast emission model for DXN emission operation optimization control becomes an immediate difficulty. To address the above problem, this research utilizes a novel DXN emission measurement method using simplified deep forest regression (DFR) with residual error fitting (SDFR-ref). First, the high-dimensional process variables are optimally reduced following the mutual information and significance test. Then, a simplified DFR algorithm is established to infer or predict the nonlinearity between the selected process variables and the DXN emission concentration. Moreover, a gradient enhancement strategy in terms of residual error fitting with a step factor is designed to improve the measurement performance in the layer-by-layer learning process. Finally, an actual DXN dataset from 2009 to 2020 of the MSWI plant in Beijing is utilized to verify the SDFR-ref method. Comparison experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other methods in terms of measurement accuracy and time consumption.

## 5300-Year-old soil carbon is less primed than young soil organic matter.
 22.01.2023, _J Su, H Zhang, X Han, R Lv, L Liu, Y Jiang, H Li, Y Kuzyakov, C Wei_


_Soil, Carbon, Nitrogen, Soil Microbiology, Glucose_
Soils harbor more than three times as much carbon (C) as the atmosphere, a large fraction of which (stable organic matter) serves as the most important global C reservoir due to its long residence time. Litter and root inputs bring fresh organic matter (FOM) into the soil and accelerate the turnover of stable C pools, and this phenomenon is termed the "priming effect" (PE). Compared with knowledge about labile soil C pools, very little is known about the vulnerability of stable C to priming. Using two soils that substantially differed in age (500 and 5300 years before present) and in the degree of chemical recalcitrance and physical protection of soil organic matter (SOM), we showed that leaf litter amendment primed 264% more organic C from the young SOM than from the old soil with very stable C. Hierarchical partitioning analysis confirmed that SOM stability, reflected mainly by available C and aggregate protection of SOM, is the most important predictor of leaf litter-induced PE. The addition of complex FOM (i.e., leaf litter) caused a higher bacterial oligotroph/copiotroph (K-/r-strategists) ratio, leading to a PE that was 583% and 126% greater than when simple FOM (i.e., glucose) was added to the young and old soils, respectively. This implies that the PE intensity depends on the chemical similarity between the primer (here FOM) and SOM. Nitrogen (N) mining existed when N and simple FOM were added (i.e., Glucose+N), and N addition raised the leaf litter-induced PE in the old soil that had low N availability, which was well explained by the microbial stoichiometry. In conclusion, the PE induced by FOM inputs strongly decreases with increasing SOM stability. However, the contribution of stable SOM to CO2 efflux cannot be disregarded due to its huge pool size.

## Divergence in cell cycle progression is associated with shifted phenology in a multivoltine moth: the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis.
 15.06.2023, _Q Xia, C Chen, EB Dopman, DA Hahn_


_Animals, Moths, Zea mays, Larva, Diapause, Cell Division_
Evolutionary change in diapause timing can be an adaptive response to changing seasonality, and even result in ecological speciation. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating shifts in diapause timing remain poorly understood. One of the hallmarks of diapause is a massive slowdown in the cell cycle of target organs such as the brain and primordial imaginal structures, and resumption of cell cycle proliferation is an indication of diapause termination and resumption of development. Characterizing cell cycle parameters between lineages differing in diapause life history timing may help identify molecular mechanisms associated with alterations of diapause timing. We tested the extent to which progression of the cell cycle differs across diapause between two genetically distinct European corn borer strains that differ in their seasonal diapause timing. We show the cell cycle slows down during larval diapause with a significant decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase. Brain-subesophageal complex cells slow primarily in G0/G1 phase whereas most wing disc cells are in G2 phase. Diapausing larvae of the earlier emerging, bivoltine E-strain (BE) suppressed cell cycle progression less than the later emerging, univoltine Z-strain (UZ) individuals, with a greater proportion of cells in S phase across both tissues during diapause. Additionally, resumption of cell cycle proliferation occurred earlier in the BE strain than in the UZ strain after exposure to diapause-terminating conditions. We propose that regulation of cell cycle progression rates ultimately drives differences in larval diapause termination, and adult emergence timing, between early- and late-emerging European corn borer strains.

The majority of the current regulatory practices for routine monitoring of beach water quality rely on the culture-based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) to develop criteria for promoting the general public's health. To address the limitations of culture methods and the arguable reliability of FIB in indicating health risks, we developed a Nanopore metagenomic sequencing-based viable cell absolute quantification workflow to rapidly and accurately estimate a broad range of microbes in beach waters by a combination of propidium monoazide (PMA) and cellular spike-ins. Using the simple synthetic bacterial communities mixed with viable and heat-killed cells, we observed near-complete relic DNA removal by PMA with minimal disturbance to the composition of viable cells, demonstrating the feasibility of PMA treatment in profiling viable cells by Nanopore sequencing. On a simple mock community comprised of 15 prokaryotic species, our results showed high accordance between the expected and estimated concentrations, suggesting the accuracy of our method in absolute quantification. We then further assessed the accuracy of our method for counting viable Escherichia coli and Vibrio spp. in beach waters by comparing to culture-based method, which were also in high agreement. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 1 Gb sequences obtained within 2 h would be sufficient to quantify a species having a concentration of ≥ 10 cells/mL in beach waters. Using our viability-resolved quantification workflow to assess the microbial risk of the beach water, we conducted (1) screening-level quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to investigate human illness risk and site-specific risk patterns that might guide risk management efforts and (2) metagenomics-based resistome risk assessment to evaluate another layer of risk caused by difficult illness treatment due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In summary, our metagenomic workflow for the rapid absolute quantification of viable bacteria demonstrated its great potential in paving new avenues toward holistic microbial risk assessment.

## ResFinderFG v2.0: a database of antibiotic resistance genes obtained by functional metagenomics.
 19.05.2023, _R Gschwind, S Ugarcina Perovic, M Weiss, M Petitjean, J Lao, LP Coelho, E Ruppé_


Metagenomics can be used to monitor the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). ARGs found in databases such as ResFinder and CARD primarily originate from culturable and pathogenic bacteria, while ARGs from non-culturable and non-pathogenic bacteria remain understudied. Functional metagenomics is based on phenotypic gene selection and can identify ARGs from non-culturable bacteria with a potentially low identity shared with known ARGs. In 2016, the ResFinderFG v1.0 database was created to collect ARGs from functional metagenomics studies. Here, we present the second version of the database, ResFinderFG v2.0, which is available on the Center of Genomic Epidemiology web server (https://cge.food.dtu.dk/services/ResFinderFG/). It comprises 3913 ARGs identified by functional metagenomics from 50 carefully curated datasets. We assessed its potential to detect ARGs in comparison to other popular databases in gut, soil and water (marine + freshwater) Global Microbial Gene Catalogues (https://gmgc.embl.de). ResFinderFG v2.0 allowed for the detection of ARGs that were not detected using other databases. These included ARGs conferring resistance to beta-lactams, cycline, phenicol, glycopeptide/cycloserine and trimethoprim/sulfonamide. Thus, ResFinderFG v2.0 can be used to identify ARGs differing from those found in conventional databases and therefore improve the description of resistomes.

## Achieving pan-microbiome biological insights via the dbBact knowledge base.
 16.06.2023, _A Amir, E Ozel, Y Haberman, N Shental_


16S rRNA amplicon sequencing provides a relatively inexpensive culture-independent method for studying microbial communities. Although thousands of such studies have examined diverse habitats, it is difficult for researchers to use this vast trove of experiments when interpreting their own findings in a broader context. To bridge this gap, we introduce dbBact - a novel pan-microbiome resource. dbBact combines manually curated information from studies across diverse habitats, creating a collaborative central repository of 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which are assigned multiple ontology-based terms. To date dbBact contains information from more than 1000 studies, which include 1500000 associations between 360000 ASVs and 6500 ontology terms. Importantly, dbBact offers a set of computational tools allowing users to easily query their own datasets against the database. To demonstrate how dbBact augments standard microbiome analysis we selected 16 published papers, and reanalyzed their data via dbBact. We uncovered novel inter-host similarities, potential intra-host sources of bacteria, commonalities across different diseases and lower host-specificity in disease-associated bacteria. We also demonstrate the ability to detect environmental sources, reagent-borne contaminants, and identify potential cross-sample contaminations. These analyses demonstrate how combining information across multiple studies and over diverse habitats leads to better understanding of underlying biological processes.
