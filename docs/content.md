## Bi-Directional Interactions Between Microbiota and Ionizing Radiation in Head and Neck and Pelvic Radiotherapy - Clinical Relevance.
 18.05.2020, _NT Joseph, SR Shankar, RK Narasimhamurthy, S Bola Sadashiva Rao, KD Mumbrekar_


Purpose: Rapid developments in high throughput screening technology for the detection and identification of the human microbiota have helped in understanding its influence on human health and disease. In the recent past, several seminal studies have demonstrated the influence of microbiota on outcomes of therapy-associated radiation exposure. In this review, we highlight the concepts related to the mechanisms by which radiation alters the microbiota composition linked with radiation-associated toxicity in head and neck and pelvic regions. We further discuss specific microbial changes that can be employed as a biomarker for radiation and tumor response.Conclusion: Knowledge of the influence of microbiota in radiation response and advances in microbiota manipulation techniques would help to design personalized treatment augmenting the efficacy of radiotherapy.

## Ketogenic Diets Alter the Gut Microbiome Resulting in Decreased Intestinal Th17 Cells.
 21.05.2020, _QY Ang, M Alexander, JC Newman, Y Tian, J Cai, V Upadhyay, JA Turnbaugh, E Verdin, KD Hall, RL Leibel, E Ravussin, M Rosenbaum, AD Patterson, PJ Turnbaugh_


Very low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diets (KDs) induce a pronounced shift in metabolic fuel utilization that elevates circulating ketone bodies; however, the consequences of these compounds for host-microbiome interactions remain unknown. Here, we show that KDs alter the human and mouse gut microbiota in a manner distinct from high-fat diets (HFDs). Metagenomic and metabolomic analyses of stool samples from an 8-week inpatient study revealed marked shifts in gut microbial community structure and function during the KD. Gradient diet experiments in mice confirmed the unique impact of KDs relative to HFDs with a reproducible depletion of bifidobacteria. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that ketone bodies selectively inhibited bifidobacterial growth. Finally, mono-colonizations and human microbiome transplantations into germ-free mice revealed that the KD-associated gut microbiota reduces the levels of intestinal pro-inflammatory Th17 cells. Together, these results highlight the importance of trans-kingdom chemical dialogs for mediating the host response to dietary interventions.

## MinION Sequencing of colorectal cancer tumour microbiomes-A comparison with amplicon-based and RNA-Sequencing.
 20.05.2020, _WS Taylor, J Pearson, A Miller, S Schmeier, FA Frizelle, RV Purcell_


Recent evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in the development and progression of many diseases and many studies have been carried out to analyse the microbiome using a variety of methods. In this study, we compare MinION sequencing with meta-transcriptomics and amplicon-based sequencing for microbiome analysis of colorectal tumour tissue samples.

## Broilers divergently selected for digestibility differ for their digestive microbial ecosystems.
 18.05.2020, _M Borey, J Estellé, A Caidi, N Bruneau, JL Coville, C Hennequet-Antier, S Mignon-Grasteau, F Calenge_


Improving the digestive efficiency of broiler chickens (Gallus gallus) could reduce organic waste, increase the use of alternative feed not used for human consumption and reduce the impact of feed in production costs. By selecting chicken lines divergently for their digestive efficiency, we showed previously that digestive efficiency is under genetic control and that the two resulting divergent lines, D+ (high digestive efficiency or "digestibility +") and D- (low digestive efficiency or "digestibility -"), also differ for the abundance of specific bacteria in their caeca. Here we perform a more extensive census of the bacteria present in the digestive microbiota of 60 chickens selected for their low apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen balance (AMEn-) or high (AMEn+) digestive efficiency in a [D+ x D-] F8 progeny of 200 individuals. We sequenced the 16S rRNA genes of the ileal, jejunal and caecal microbiotas, and compared the compositions and predicted functions of microbiotas from the different intestinal segments for 20 AMEn+ and 19 AMEn- birds. The intestinal segment of origin was the main factor structuring the samples. The caecal microbiota was the most impacted by the differences in digestive efficiency, with 41 bacterial species with abundances differing between highly and poorly efficient birds. Furthermore, we predicted that the caecal microbiota of efficient birds might be enriched in genes contributing to the degradation of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) from non-starch polysaccharides. These results confirm the impact of the genetic selection led on digestibility on the caecal microbiota taxonomic composition. They open the way toward the identification of specific, causal genes of the host controlling variations in the abundances of bacterial taxons.

## Dietary Isomalto/Malto-Polysaccharides Increase Fecal Bulk and Microbial Fermentation in Mice.
 14.05.2020, _RH Mistry, K Borewicz, F Gu, HJ Verkade, HA Schols, H Smidt, UJF Tietge_


The prevalence of metabolic-syndrome-related disease has strongly increased. Nutritional intervention strategies appear attractive, particularly with novel prebiotics. Isomalto/malto-polysaccharides (IMMPs) represent promising novel prebiotics that promote proliferation of beneficial bacteria in vitro. The present study investigates for the first time the in vivo effects of IMMP in mice.
