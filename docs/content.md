This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Praziquantel-related visual disorders among recipients in mass drug administration campaigns in schistosomiasis endemic settings: Systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.

_Humans, Schistosomiasis, Praziquantel, Vision Disorders, Systematic Reviews as Topic, Mass Drug Administration, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Endemic Diseases, Anthelmintics_
Hundreds of millions of doses of Praziquantel (PZQ) have been administered to persons with and without schistosomiasis living in schistosomiasis endemic settings, through the mass drug administration (MDA) strategy which started in the early 2000s. A recent publication suggested high risk of PZQ-related visual disorders, raising public health concerns. We aim to systematically synthesize evidence on the magnitude of PZQ-related visual disorders.

## Biochar is colonized by select arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in agricultural soils.
 17.05.2024, _P Neuberger, C Romero, K Kim, X Hao, T A McAllister, S Ngo, C Li, MA Gorzelak_


Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonize biochar in soils, yet the processes governing their colonization and growth in biochar are not well characterized. Biochar amendment improves soil health by increasing soil carbon, decreasing bulk density, and improving soil water retention, all of which can increase yield and alleviate environmental stress on crops. Biochar is often applied with nutrient addition, impacting mycorrhizal communities. To understand how mycorrhizas explore soils containing biochar, we buried packets of non-activated biochar in root exclusion mesh bags in contrasting agricultural soils. In this greenhouse experiment, with quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) as the host plant, we tested impacts of mineral nutrient (as manure and fertilizer) and biochar addition on mycorrhizal colonization of biochar. Paraglomus appeared to dominate the biochar packets, and the community of AMF found in the biochar was a subset (12 of 18) of the virtual taxa detected in soil communities. We saw differences in AMF community composition between soils with different edaphic properties, and while nutrient addition shifted those communities, the shifts were inconsistent between soil types and did not significantly influence the observation that Paraglomus appeared to selectively colonize biochar. This observation may reflect differences in AMF traits, with Paraglomus previously identified only in soils (not in roots) pointing to predominately soil exploratory traits. Conversely, the absence of some AMF from the biochar implies either a reduced tendency to explore soils or an ability to avoid recalcitrant nutrient sources. Our results point to a selective colonization of biochar in agricultural soils.

Vastly greater quantities of microbial genome data are being generated where environmental samples mix together the DNA from many different species. Here, we present Opal for metagenomic binning, the task of identifying the origin species of DNA sequencing reads. We introduce 'low-density' locality sensitive hashing to bioinformatics, with the addition of Gallager codes for even coverage, enabling quick and accurate metagenomic binning.
