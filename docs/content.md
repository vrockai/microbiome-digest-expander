## Re-evaluating the relationship between missing heritability and the microbiome.
 12.06.2020, _GM Douglas, JP Bielawski, MGI Langille_


Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have recurrently estimated lower heritability estimates than familial studies. Many explanations have been suggested to explain these lower estimates, including that a substantial proportion of genetic variation and gene-by-environment interactions are unmeasured in typical GWASs. The human microbiome is potentially related to both of these explanations, but it has been more commonly considered as a source of unmeasured genetic variation. In particular, it has recently been argued that the genetic variation within the human microbiome should be included when estimating trait heritability. We outline issues with this argument, which in its strictest form depends on the holobiont model of human-microbiome interactions. Instead, we argue that the microbiome could be leveraged to help control for environmental variation across a population, although that remains to be determined. We discuss potential approaches that could be explored to determine whether integrating microbiome sequencing data into GWASs is useful. Video abstract.

## The Bacterial Microbiota of Gastrointestinal Cancers: Role in Cancer Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Perspectives.
 25.05.2020, _L Elsalem, AA Jum'ah, MA Alfaqih, O Aloudat_


The microbiota has an essential role in the pathogenesis of many gastrointestinal diseases including cancer. This effect is mediated through different mechanisms such as damaging DNA, activation of oncogenic pathways, production of carcinogenic metabolites, stimulation of chronic inflammation, and inhibition of antitumor immunity. Recently, the concept of "pharmacomicrobiomics" has emerged as a new field concerned with exploring the interplay between drugs and microbes. Mounting evidence indicates that the microbiota and their metabolites have a major impact on the pharmacodynamics and therapeutic responses toward anticancer drugs including conventional chemotherapy and molecular -targeted therapeutics. In addition, microbiota appears as an attractive target for cancer prevention and treatment. In this review, we discuss the role of bacterial microbiota in the pathogenesis of different cancer types affecting the gastrointestinal tract system. We also scrutinize the evidence regarding the role of microbiota in anticancer drug responses. Further, we discuss the use of probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and antibiotics, either alone or in combination with anticancer drugs for prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal tract cancers.

## The skin microbiome of elasmobranchs follows phylosymbiosis, but in teleost fishes, the microbiomes converge.

The vertebrate clade diverged into Chondrichthyes (sharks, rays, and chimeras) and Osteichthyes fishes (bony fishes) approximately 420 mya, with each group accumulating vast anatomical and physiological differences, including skin properties. The skin of Chondrichthyes fishes is covered in dermal denticles, whereas Osteichthyes fishes are covered in scales and are mucous rich. The divergence time among these two fish groups is hypothesized to result in predictable variation among symbionts. Here, using shotgun metagenomics, we test if patterns of diversity in the skin surface microbiome across the two fish clades match predictions made by phylosymbiosis theory. We hypothesize (1) the skin microbiome will be host and clade-specific, (2) evolutionary difference in elasmobranch and teleost will correspond with a concomitant increase in host-microbiome dissimilarity, and (3) the skin structure of the two groups will affect the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbiomes.

## Topography of the respiratory tract bacterial microbiota in cattle.
 13.06.2020, _C McMullen, TW Alexander, R Léguillette, M Workentine, E Timsit_


Bacterial bronchopneumonia (BP) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cattle. The nasopharynx is generally accepted as the primary source of pathogenic bacteria that cause BP. However, it has recently been shown in humans that the oropharynx may act as the primary reservoir for pathogens that reach the lung. The objective was therefore to describe the bacterial microbiota present along the entire cattle respiratory tract to determine which upper respiratory tract (URT) niches may contribute the most to the composition of the lung microbiota.

Understanding the large-scale patterns of microbial functional diversity is essential for anticipating climate change impacts on ecosystems worldwide. However, studies of functional biogeography remain scarce for microorganisms, especially in freshwater ecosystems. Here we study 15,289 functional genes of stream biofilm microbes along three elevational gradients in Norway, Spain and China.

## Bacterial Diversity of a High-Altitude Permafrost Thaw Pond Located on Ojos del Salado (Dry Andes, Altiplano-Atacama Region).
 11.06.2020, _JM Aszalós, A Szabó, M Megyes, D Anda, B Nagy, AK Borsodi_


Microbial ecology of permafrost, due to its ecological and astrobiological importance, has been in the focus of studies in past decades. Although permafrost is an ancient and stable environment, it is also subjected to current climate changes. Permafrost degradation often results in generation of thaw ponds, a phenomenon not only reported mainly from polar regions but also present in high-altitude permafrost environments. Our knowledge about microbial communities of thaw ponds in these unique, remote mountain habitats is sparse. This study presents the first culture collection and results of the next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) analysis of bacterial communities inhabiting a high-altitude permafrost thaw pond. In February 2016, a permafrost thaw pond on the Ojos del Salado at 5900 m a.s.l. (meters above sea level) was sampled as part of the Hungarian Dry Andes Research Programme. A culture collection of 125 isolates was established, containing altogether 11 genera belonging to phyla Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Simplified bacterial communities with a high proportion of candidate and hitherto uncultured bacteria were revealed by Illumina MiSeq NGS. Water of the thaw pond was dominated by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, while in the sediment of the lake and permafrost, members of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Patescibacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were abundant. This permafrost habitat can be interesting as a potential Mars analog.

## Effects of Active Volcanism on Bacterial Communities in the Highest-Altitude Crater Lake of Ojos del Salado (Dry Andes, Altiplano-Atacama Region).
 11.06.2020, _JM Aszalós, A Szabó, T Felföldi, L Jurecska, B Nagy, AK Borsodi_


Periglacial and volcanic environments are considered terrestrial analogs of Mars with regard to astrobiological characteristics due to their specific set of extreme features. Ojos del Salado, the highest volcano on Earth (6893 m a.s.l.), is surrounded by several craters, one of which harbors the highest known altitude lake (6480 m a.s.l.), which is influenced by a rare combination of extreme environmental factors, that is, low mean temperature, permafrost, fumarolic activity, acidity, and extreme low organic matter content. To assess the genetic diversity and ecological tolerance of bacteria, samples were taken in February 2016 from the sediments covered with acidic cold (pH 4.88, 3.8°C) and warm (pH 2.08, 40.8°C) water. As a control, a nonvolcanic high-altitude lake (at 5900 m a.s.l.) was also studied by both cultivation-based and next-generation DNA sequencing methods. Isolates from the crater lake showed tolerance toward acidic pH values, unlike isolates from the nonvolcanic lake. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene exposed simplified, although characteristically different, bacterial communities in the warm and cold water-saturated sediments. In the fumarolic creek sediments, acidophilic iron oxidizers (Ferrithrix, Gallionella) and iron reducers (Acidiphilium) were abundant, and bacteria involved in the sulfur oxidation (Hydrogenobaculum, Thiomonas) and reduction (Desulfosporosinus) were also detected. Therefore, we propose an integrated model that addresses the potential role of bacteria in the sulfur and iron geomicrobiological cycles.

## Methanogenesis in the Lake Elton saline aquatic system.
 13.06.2020, _A Kallistova, A Merkel, T Kanapatskiy, Y Boltyanskaya, I Tarnovetskii, A Perevalova, V Kevbrin, O Samylina, N Pimenov_


Cultivation and molecular approaches were used to study methanogenesis in saline aquatic system of the Lake Elton (southern Russia), the largest hypersaline lake in Europe. The potential rates of hydrogenotrophic, acetoclastic, methylotrophic and methyl-reducing methanogenesis and diversity of the growth-enriched for by adding electron donors methanogenic communities were studied in the sediment slurry incubations at salinity range from 7 to 275 g/L. The most active pathway detected at all salinities was methylotrophic with a dominance of Methanohalobium and Methanohalophilus genera, at salt saturation and moderately halophilic Methanolobus and Methanococcoides at lower salinity. The absence of methane production from acetate, formate and H2/CO2 under hypersaline conditions was most probably associated with the energy constraints. The contribution of hydrogenotrophic, acetoclastic, and methyl-reducing methanogens to the community increases with a decrease in salinity. Temperature might play an important regulatory function in hypersaline habitats; i.e. methylotrophic methanogens and hydrogenotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) outcompeting methyl-reducing methanogens under mesophilic conditions, and vice versa under thermophilic conditions. An active methane production together with negligible methane oxidation makes hypersaline environments a potential source of methane emission.

## Auxotrophic interactions: A stabilizing attribute of aquatic microbial communities?
 10.06.2020, _WM Johnson, H Alexander, RL Bier, DR Miller, ME Muscarella, KJ Pitz, H Smith_


Auxotrophy, or an organism's requirement for an exogenous source of an organic molecule, is widespread throughout species and ecosystems. Auxotrophy can result in obligate interactions between organisms, influencing ecosystem structure and community composition. We explore how auxotrophy-induced interactions between aquatic microorganisms affect microbial community structure and stability. While some studies have documented auxotrophy in aquatic microorganisms, these studies are not widespread, and we therefore do not know the full extent of auxotrophic interactions in aquatic environments. Current theoretical and experimental work suggests that auxotrophy links microbial community members through a complex web of metabolic dependencies. We discuss the proposed ways in which auxotrophy may enhance or undermine the stability of aquatic microbial communities, highlighting areas where our limited understanding of these interactions prevents us from being able to predict the ecological implications of auxotrophy. Finally, we examine an example of auxotrophy in harmful algal blooms to place this often theoretical discussion in a field context where auxotrophy may have implications for the development and robustness of algal bloom communities. We seek to draw attention to the relationship between auxotrophy and community stability in an effort to encourage further field and theoretical work that explores the underlying principles of microbial interactions.

Obtaining objective, dietary exposure information from individuals is challenging because of the complexity of food consumption patterns and the limitations of self-reporting tools (e.g., FFQ and diet diaries). This hinders research efforts to associate intakes of specific foods or eating patterns with population health outcomes.
