 23.02.2021, _S Gieschler, G Fiedler, C Böhnlein, C Grimmler, CMAP Franz, J Kabisch_


In this study, nine Gram-negative, motile and rod-shaped bacteria were isolated during a Germany-wide investigation of raw milk microbiota. The strains could be differentiated from their closest relatives by phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characterization and average nucleotide identity (ANIb) values calculated from draft genome assemblies. Strains MBT-1T, MBT-8, MBT-9, MBT-10, MBT-11 and MBT-12 were related to the Pseudomonas chlororaphis subgroup. Isolates MBT-2T, MBT-13 and MBT-14 were closely related to Pseudomonas rhizosphaerae DSM 16299T with an ANIb of 88.2 % and a genome-to-genome distance result of 36.0 %. The G+C content of the DNA of strains MBT-1T and MBT-2T was 60.84 and 62.48 mol%, respectively. The major fatty acids were C16 : 1 ω7c (summed feature 3), C16 : 0 and C18 : 1 ω7c (summed feature 8). The strains were catalase-positive, while production of urease, β-galactosidase and indole were negative. Growth occurred at 4-30 °C and at pH values of pH 6.0-8.0. Based on these results, we conclude that the strains belong to two novel species, for which the names Pseudomonas kielensis sp. nov. and Pseudomonas baltica sp. nov. are proposed. The type strains are MBT-1T (=DSM 111668 T= LMG 31954T) and MBT-2T (=DSM 111761 T=LMG 31955T).

## Gut microbiome diversity is an independent predictor of survival in cervical cancer patients receiving chemoradiation.
 23.02.2021, _TT Sims, MB El Alam, TV Karpinets, S Dorta-Estremera, VL Hegde, S Nookala, K Yoshida-Court, X Wu, GWG Biegert, AY Delgado Medrano, T Solley, M Ahmed-Kaddar, BV Chapman, KJ Sastry, MP Mezzari, JF Petrosino, LL Lin, L Ramondetta, A Jhingran, KM Schmeler, NJ Ajami, J Wargo, LE Colbert, AH Klopp_


Diversity of the gut microbiome is associated with higher response rates for cancer patients receiving immunotherapy but has not been investigated in patients receiving radiation therapy. Additionally, current studies investigating the gut microbiome and outcomes in cancer patients may not have adjusted for established risk factors. Here, we sought to determine if diversity and composition of the gut microbiome was independently associated with survival in cervical cancer patients receiving chemoradiation. Our study demonstrates that the diversity of gut microbiota is associated with a favorable response to chemoradiation. Additionally, compositional variation among patients correlated with short term and long-term survival. Short term survivor fecal samples were significantly enriched in Porphyromonas, Porphyromonadaceae, and Dialister, whereas long term survivor samples were significantly enriched in Escherichia Shigella, Enterobacteriaceae, and Enterobacteriales. Moreover, analysis of immune cells from cervical tumor brush samples by flow cytometry revealed that patients with a high microbiome diversity had increased tumor infiltration of CD4+ lymphocytes as well as activated subsets of CD4 cells expressing ki67+ and CD69+ over the course of radiation therapy. Modulation of the gut microbiota before chemoradiation might provide an alternative way to enhance treatment efficacy and improve treatment outcomes in cervical cancer patients.

The human skin microbiota is considered to be essential for skin homeostasis and barrier function. Comprehensive analyses of its function would substantially benefit from a catalog of reference genes derived from metagenomic sequencing. The existing catalog for the human skin microbiome is based on samples from limited individuals from a single cohort on reference genomes, which limits the coverage of global skin microbiome diversity.

## Microbial analyses of blood spot surfaces collected from a laboratory and the bathroom of a female single-person household under different environmental conditions.
 23.02.2021, _HS You, SH Lee, YJ Lee, HJ Sung, HG Kang, SH Hyun_


Many people spend most of their time indoors, thereby exposing themselves to indoor environmental microbial communities that might interact with the human microbiota. These potential interactions have only been considered for personal identification; however, accumulating evidence indicates that these microbial interactions are potentially implicated with the identification of human interactions and location-specific factors including time and seasonal variations in the microbial community. To augment the potential of metagenomics-based forensic tools, we compared the composition of microbial communities in blood spot surfaces from healthy adults placed in different environments, such as in the bathroom of a female single-person household and on a laboratory, which were sampled across seasons and time points. The laboratory samples showed more changes in the bacterial community over time owing to the higher number of individuals using the laboratory, whereas the microbial communities in the bathroom samples remained relatively stable over time. Moreover, the two locations could be distinguished according to their specific bacterial community compositions. Variations were also observed related to changes in temperature and humidity, allowing for prediction of season-based microbial community. These findings offer a new perspective regarding the use of microbial community analysis in forensic science.

## Antidepressants fluoxetine and amitriptyline induce alterations in intestinal microbiota and gut microbiome function in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress.
 19.02.2021, _W Zhang, W Qu, H Wang, H Yan_


Antidepressant medications are known to modulate the central nervous system, and gut microbiota can play a role in depression via microbiota-gut-brain axis. But the impact of antidepressants on gut microbiota function and composition remains poorly understood. Thus this study assessed the effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant fluoxetine (Flu) and tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline (Ami) administration on gut microbiota composition, diversity, and species abundance, along with microbial function in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression rat model. Oral administration of Ami and Flu significantly altered the overall gut microbiota profile of CUMS-induced rats, as assessed using the permutational multivariate analysis of variance test. At the phylum level, 6-week of antidepressant treatment led to a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio due to an enhanced Bacteroidetes and reduced Firmicutes relative abundance. Flu was more potent than Ami at altering the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes levels in the CUMS rats. At the family level, both antidepressants significantly increased the abundance of Porphyromonadaceae. However, an increased Bacteroidaceae level was significantly associated with Ami, not Flu treatment. Furthermore, at the genus level, an increase in the relative abundance of Parabacteroides, Butyricimonas, and Alistipes was observed following Ami and Flu treatment. Subsequent metagenomics and bioinformatics analysis further indicated that Ami and Flu likely also modulated metabolic pathways, such as those involved in carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport, and signal transduction. Additionally, both antidepressants affected antibiotic resistome, such as for aminoglycoside (aph3iiiA), multidrug (mdtK, mdtP, mdtH, mdtG, acrA), and tetracycline (tetM) resistance in CUMS rats. These data clearly illustrated the direct impact of oral administration of Flu and Ami on the gut microbiome, thus set up the foundation to reveal more insights on the therapeutic function of the antidepressants and their overall contribution to host health.

## Ginsenoside Rk3 Ameliorates Obesity-Induced Colitis by Regulating of Intestinal Flora and the TLR4/NF-κB Signaling Pathway in C57BL/6 Mice.
 23.02.2021, _H Chen, H Yang, J Deng, D Fan_


Obesity-induced colonic inflammation-stimulated colitis is one of the main causes of colorectal cancer. Dietary phytochemicals are considered to be an effective strategy for relieving obesity-induced inflammatory diseases such as diabetes and colitis. Ginsenoside Rk3 (Rk3) is the main bioactive component of ginseng. Our previous study has demonstrated that Rk3 can effectively alleviate obesity-induced type 2 diabetes, but whether it plays a beneficial role in obesity-induced colitis remains poorly understood. Here, we found that Rk3 intervention repaired the intestinal barrier dysfunction by increasing the expression of the tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, claudin, and occludin), and reduced colonic inflammatory cytokine levels, oxidative stress, and macrophage infiltration in high-fat diet-induced mice. Importantly, Rk3 effectively ameliorated the metabolic dysbiosis of intestinal flora with significantly decreased Firmicute/Bacteroidete ratios and suppressed the inflammatory cascade by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that Rk3 can be used as a potential natural anti-inflammatory agent to reduce chronic obesity-induced colitis.

## Effects of supplementing sow diets during late gestation with Pennisetum purpureum on antioxidant indices, immune parameters and faecal microbiota.
 23.02.2021, _PF Huang, Q Mou, Y Yang, JM Li, ML Xu, J Huang, JZ Li, HS Yang, XX Liang, YL Yin_


The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of adding Pennisetum purpureum (P. purpureum, also known as Napier grass or elephant grass) to the diets of late gestation on the antioxidant indexes, immune indexes and faecal microbiota of sows. At the 90 days of gestation, 300 healthy sows were randomly divided into three groups, and they received the basic commercial diet or added 5% P. purpureum and 10% P. purpureum, respectively. The experiment started from 90 days of gestation to parturition. The results showed that the total antioxidant capacity, immunoglobulins and serum equol concentrations of sows on 100 days of gestation and at parturition increased linearly (p &lt; .05) with the increase of the content of P. purpureum in the gestation diet. The 5% P. purpureum increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (p = .027) and Actinobacteria (p &lt; .001) at phylum level, Coriobacteriaceae (p &lt; .001) at family level and Prevotellaceae_UCG_001 (p = .004) at genus level, and decreased the relative abundance of Escherichia_Shigella (p &lt; .001) at genus level. In summary, this study shows that the additive of P. purpureum can increase the concentration of serum equol, improve the antioxidant capacity and immune function of sow in late gestation. In addition, the additive of 5% P. purpureum in the diet might change the composition of intestinal microbiota of sows, particularly the relative abundance of Coriobacteriaceae (p &lt; .001) increased.

## Alterations in the gut microbiome and metabolic profile in rats acclimated to high environmental temperature.
 23.02.2021, _Y Cao, Y Liu, Q Dong, T Wang, C Niu_


Heat acclimation (HA) is the best strategy to improve heat stress tolerance by inducing positive physiological adaptations. Evidence indicates that the gut microbiome plays a fundamental role in the development of HA, and modulation of gut microbiota can improve tolerance to heat exposure and decrease the risks of heat illness. In this study, for the first time, we applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics to explore variations in the gut microbiome and faecal metabolic profiles in rats after HA. The gut microbiota of HA subjects exhibited higher diversity and richer microbes. HA altered the gut microbiota composition with significant increases in the genera Lactobacillus (a major probiotic) and Oscillospira alongside significant decreases in the genera Blautia and Allobaculum. The faecal metabolome was also significantly changed after HA, and among the 13 perturbed metabolites, (S)-AL 8810 and celastrol were increased. Moreover, the two increased genera were positively correlated with the two upregulated metabolites and negatively correlated with the other 11 downregulated metabolites, while the correlations between the two decreased genera and the upregulated/downregulated metabolites were completely contrary. In summary, both the structure of the gut microbiome community and the faecal metabolome were improved after 28 days of HA. These findings provide novel insights regarding the improvement of the gut microbiome and its functions as a potential mechanism by which HA confers protection against heat stress.

## The pelvic flexure separates distinct microbial communities in the equine hindgut.
 23.02.2021, _KJ Reed, IGZ Kunz, JA Scare, MK Nielsen, PJ Turk, RJ Coleman, SJ Coleman_


As hindgut fermenters, horses are especially dependent on the microbiota residing in their cecum and large intestines. Interactions between these microbial populations and the horse are critical for maintaining gut homeostasis, which supports proper digestion. The current project was motivated to determine if any features of the fecal microbiota are informative of the microbial communities from the cecum, ventral colon, or dorsal colon. Digesta from the cecum, ventral colon, dorsal colon and feces were collected from 6 yearling miniature horses. Microbial DNA was isolated and the microbiota from each sample was characterized by profiling the V4 region of the 16S rRNA. Principal coordinate analysis of the beta diversity results revealed significant (p = 0.0001; F = 5.2393) similarities between the microbial populations from cecal and ventral colon and the dorsal colon and fecal samples, however, there was little overlap between the proximal and distal ends of the hindgut. These distinct population structures observed in our results coincide with the pelvic flexure, which itself separates intestinal compartments with distinct roles in digestive physiology. An indicator species analysis confirmed the population differences, supported by the identification of several microbial families characteristic of the compartments upstream of the pelvic flexure that were not represented following it. Our data suggest that the fecal microbiota is not informative of the proximal hindgut but can provide insight into communities of the distal compartments. Further, our results suggest that the pelvic flexure might be an important anatomical landmark relative to the microbial communities in the equine large intestine.

## Effects of urolithins on obesity-associated gut dysbiosis in rats fed on a high-fat diet.
 23.02.2021, _AO Abdulrahman, MY Alzubaidi, MS Nadeem, JA Khan, IA Rather, MI Khan_


Obesity is a global health concern associated with the dysbiosis of intestinal microbial composition. In this study, we investigated the potentials of urolithin A (Uro-A) and urolithin B (Uro-B), two gut microbiota-derived metabolites of ellagitannins, in reducing body weight gain through the modulation of the gut microbiota. We established a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model in rats that were later administered with either 2.5 mg/kg of Uro-A or Uro-B. Serum biochemical parameters were quantified, and changes in the composition of the gut microbial community were analysed using 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Our results showed that the urolithins significantly decreased the body weight in HFD-fed rats and restored serum lipid profile. The taxonomic analysis showed that both Uro-A and Uro-modulated gut microbes related to body weight, dysfunctional lipid metabolism and inflammation. Overall, our results suggest that Uro-A and Uro-B possess anti-obesity properties, which may be related to the modulation of the gut microbial composition.

## Prebiotic Lactulose Ameliorates the Cognitive Deficit in Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model through Macroautophagy and Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy Pathways.
 22.02.2021, _YS Lee, DM Lai, HJ Huang, GJ Lee-Chen, CH Chang, HM Hsieh-Li, GC Lee_


Lactulose, as a prebiotic, can be utilized by human gut microbiota and stimulate their growth. Although microbiota modulation has become an emerging approach to manage many diseases and can be achieved by the administration of prebiotics, fewer investigations have been carried out on the therapeutic mechanism of lactulose. Two trehalose analogs, lactulose and melibiose, were identified as having a neuroprotective effect in polyglutamine and Parkinson disease models. In this study, we examined lactulose and melibiose in a mouse primary hippocampal neuronal culture under the toxicity of oligomeric Aβ25-35. Lactulose was further tested in vivo because its effective concentration is lower than that of melibiose. Lactulose and trehalose were applied individually to mice before a bilateral intrahippocampal CA1 injection of oligomeric Aβ25-35. The administration of lactulose and trehalose attenuated the short-term memory and the learning retrieval of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. From a pathological analysis, we found that the pretreatment of lactulose and trehalose decreased neuroinflammation and increased the levels of the autophagic pathways. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of both lactulose and trehalose are achieved through anti-inflammation and autophagy. In addition, lactulose was better than trehalose in the enhancement of the synaptic protein expression level in AD mice. Therefore, lactulose could potentially be developed into a preventive and/or therapeutic disaccharide for AD.

## Ingredients for microbial life preserved in 3.5 billion-year-old fluid inclusions.
 19.02.2021, _H Mißbach, JP Duda, AM van den Kerkhof, V Lüders, A Pack, J Reitner, V Thiel_


It is widely hypothesised that primeval life utilised small organic molecules as sources of carbon and energy. However, the presence of such primordial ingredients in early Earth habitats has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report the existence of indigenous organic molecules and gases in primary fluid inclusions in c. 3.5-billion-year-old barites (Dresser Formation, Pilbara Craton, Western Australia). The compounds identified (e.g., H2S, COS, CS2, CH4, acetic acid, organic (poly-)sulfanes, thiols) may have formed important substrates for purported ancestral sulfur and methanogenic metabolisms. They also include stable building blocks of methyl thioacetate (methanethiol, acetic acid) - a putative key agent in primordial energy metabolism and thus the emergence of life. Delivered by hydrothermal fluids, some of these compounds may have fuelled microbial communities associated with the barite deposits. Our findings demonstrate that early Archaean hydrothermal fluids contained essential primordial ingredients that provided fertile substrates for earliest life on our planet.
