## Intestinal fermentation in vitro models to study food- induced gut microbiota shift: an updated review.
 08.06.2020, _L Nissen, F Casciano, A Gianotti_


In vitro gut fermentation models were firstly introduced in nutrition and applied microbiology research back in the nineties. These models have improved greatly during time, mainly over the resemblance to the complexity of digestion stages, the replication of experimental conditions, the multitude of ecological parameters to assay. The state of the science is that the most competitive models shall include a complex gut microbiota, small working volumes, distinct interconnected compartments, and rigorous bio-chemical and ecological settings, controlled by a computer, as well as a free-hands accessibility, not to contaminate the mock microbiota. These models are a useful tool to study the impact of a given diet compound, e.g. prebiotics, on the human gut microbiota. The principal application is to focus on the shift of the core microbial groups and selected species together with their metabolites, assaying their diversity, richness, and abundance in the community over time. Besides, it is possible to study how a compound is digested, which metabolic pathways are triggered, and the type and quantity of microbial metabolites produced. Further prospective should focus on challenges with pathogens as well as on ecology of gut syndromes. In this minireview an updated presentation of the most used intestinal models is presented, basing on their concept, technical features, as well as on research applications.

## Assessing similarities and disparities in the skin microbiota between wild and laboratory populations of house mice.
 10.06.2020, _M Belheouane, M Vallier, A Čepić, CJ Chung, S Ibrahim, JF Baines_


The house mouse is a key model organism in skin research including host-microbiota interactions, yet little is known about the skin microbiota of free-living mice. It is similarly unclear how closely laboratory mice, which typically live under exceptionally hygienic conditions, resemble the ancestral state of microbial variation in the wild. In this study, we sampled an area spanning 270 km2 in south-west France and collected 203 wild Mus musculus domesticus. We profiled the ear skin microbiota on standing and active communities (DNA-based and RNA-based 16 rRNA gene sequencing, respectively), and compared multiple community aspects between wild-caught and laboratory-reared mice kept in distinct facilities. Compared to lab mice, we reveal the skin microbiota of wild mice on the one hand to be unique in their composition within the Staphylococcus genus, with a majority of sequences most closely matching known novobiocin-resistant species, and display evidence of a rare biosphere. On the other hand, despite drastic disparities between natural and laboratory environments, we find that shared taxa nonetheless make up the majority of the core skin microbiota of both wild- and laboratory skin communities, suggesting that mammalian skin is a highly specialized habitat capable of strong selection from available species pools. Finally, the influence of environmental factors suggests RNA-based profiling as a preferred method to reduce environmental noise.

## Competitive traits of coral symbionts may alter the structure and function of the microbiome.
 10.06.2020, _SE McIlroy, JCY Wong, DM Baker_


In the face of global warming and unprecedented coral bleaching, a new avenue of research is focused on relatively rare algal symbionts and their ability to confer thermal tolerance to their host by association. Yet, thermal tolerance is just one of many physiological attributes inherent to the diversity of symbiodinians, a result of millions of years of competition and niche partitioning. Here, we revealed that competition among cocultured symbiodinians alters nutrient assimilation and compound production with species-specific responses. For Cladocopium goreaui, a species ubiquitous within stable coral associations, temperature stress increased sensitivity to competition eliciting a shift toward investment in cell replication, i.e., putative niche exploitation. Meanwhile, competition led Durusdinium trenchii, a thermally tolerant "background" symbiodinian, to divert resources from immediate growth to storage. As such, competition may be driving the dominance of C. goreaui outside of temperature stress, the destabilization of symbioses under thermal stress, the repopulation of coral tissues by D. trenchii following bleaching, and ultimately undermine the efficacy of symbiont turnover as an adaptive mechanism.

## Eutrophication as a driver of microbial community structure in lake sediments.
 08.06.2020, _X Han, CJ Schubert, A Fiskal, N Dubois, MA Lever_


Lake sediments are globally important carbon sinks. Although the fate of organic carbon (OC) in lake sediments depends significantly on microorganisms, only few studies have investigated controls on lake sedimentary microbial communities. Here we investigate the impact of anthropogenic eutrophication, which affects redox chemistry and organic matter (OM) sources in sediments, on microbial communities across five lakes in central Switzerland. Lipid biomarkers and distributions of microbial respiration reactions indicate strong increases in aquatic OM contributions and microbial activity with increasing trophic state. Across all lakes, 16S rRNA genes analyses indicate similar depth-dependent zonations at the phylum- and class-level that follow vertical distributions of OM sources and respiration reactions. Yet, there are notable differences, such as higher abundances of nitrifying Bacteria and Archaea in oligotrophic lake. Furthermore, analyses at order-level and below suggest changes in OM sources due to eutrophication cause permanent changes in bacterial community structure. By contrast, archaeal communities are differentiated according to trophic state in recently deposited layers, but converge in older sediments deposited under different trophic regimes. Our study indicates an important role for trophic state in driving lacustrine sediment microbial communities and reveals fundamental differences in the temporal responses of sediment Bacteria and Archaea to eutrophication.

## MetaFS: Performance assessment of biomarker discovery in metaproteomics.
 08.06.2020, _J Tang, M Mou, Y Wang, Y Luo, F Zhu_


Metaproteomics suffers from the issues of dimensionality and sparsity. Data reduction methods can maximally identify the relevant subset of significant differential features and reduce data redundancy. Feature selection (FS) methods were applied to obtain the significant differential subset. So far, a variety of feature selection methods have been developed for metaproteomic study. However, due to FS's performance depended heavily on the data characteristics of a given research, the well-suitable feature selection method must be carefully selected to obtain the reproducible differential proteins. Moreover, it is critical to evaluate the performance of each FS method according to comprehensive criteria, because the single criterion is not sufficient to reflect the overall performance of the FS method. Therefore, we developed an online tool named MetaFS, which provided 13 types of FS methods and conducted the comprehensive evaluation on the complex FS methods using four widely accepted and independent criteria. Furthermore, the function and reliability of MetaFS were systematically tested and validated via two case studies. In sum, MetaFS could be a distinguished tool for discovering the overall well-performed FS method for selecting the potential biomarkers in microbiome studies. The online tool is freely available at https://idrblab.org/metafs/.

## The Impact of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Canada 2018: Epidemiology.
 25.02.2020, _GG Kaplan, CN Bernstein, S Coward, A Bitton, SK Murthy, GC Nguyen, K Lee, J Cooke-Lauder, EI Benchimol_


Canada has among the highest incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the world. After decades of rising incidence of IBD in Canada during the 20th Century, the prevalence of IBD in 2018 is 0.7% of the Canadian population. Forecasting models predict that prevalence of IBD will continue to rise to 1.0% of the population by 2030. In 2018, the number of Canadians living with IBD is approximately 270,000 and is predicted to rise to 403,000 Canadians in 2030. Inflammatory bowel disease affects all age groups with adolescents and young adults at highest risk of diagnosis. Canadians of all ethnicities are being diagnosed with IBD including known high-risk groups such as Ashkenazi Jews and offspring of South Asian immigrants who were previously thought to be low risk. Moreover, IBD has evolved into a global disease with rising incidence in newly industrialized countries in Asia and South America. The causes of IBD remain unsolved; however, the high rates of disease in Western countries and its emergence in newly industrialized countries suggest that environmental factors associated with urbanization, modernization, or Western diets may be pertinent to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease.
