## The role of the gut microbiota in regulating responses to vaccination: current knowledge and future directions.
 05.08.2024, _C Rossouw, FJ Ryan, DJ Lynn_


Antigen-specific B and T cell responses play a critical role in vaccine-mediated protection against infectious diseases, but these responses are highly variable between individuals and vaccine immunogenicity is frequently sub-optimal in infants, the elderly and in people living in low- and middle-income countries. Although many factors such as nutrition, age, sex, genetics, environmental exposures, and infections may all contribute to variable vaccine immunogenicity, mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is an important and targetable factor shaping optimal immune responses to vaccination. In this review, we discuss evidence from human, preclinical and experimental studies supporting a role for a healthy gut microbiota in mediating optimal vaccine immunogenicity, including the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the potential mechanisms through which this could occur and discuss strategies that could be used to target the microbiota to boost vaccine immunogenicity where it is currently sub-optimal.

Elevated systemic antibody responses against gut microbiota flagellins are observed in both Crohn's disease (CD) and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), suggesting potential serological biomarkers for diagnosis. However, flagellin-specific antibody repertoires and functional roles in the diseases remain incompletely understood. Bacterial flagellins can be categorized into three types depending on their interaction with toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5): (1) "stimulator" and (2) "silent" flagellins, which bind TLR5 through a conserved N-terminal motif, with only stimulators activating TLR5 (involving a C-terminal domain); (3) "evader" flagellins of pathogens, which entirely circumvent TLR5 activation via mutations in the N-terminal TLR5 binding motif.

Colostrum is the first milk for a newborn. Its high content in microbiota shaping compounds and its intake at the time of gut microbiota seeding suggests colostrum may be critical in the establishment of a healthy microbiota. There is also accumulating evidence on the importance of the gut microbiota for healthy growth. Here, we aimed to investigate the contribution of colostrum, and colostrum-induced microbiota to growth promotion. Addressing this question is highly significant because (1) globally, less than half of the newborns are fully colostrum fed (2) the evidence for the importance of the microbiota for the prevention of undernutrition has only been demonstrated in juvenile or adult pre-clinical models while stunting already starts before weaning.

## Delivery mode is a larger determinant of infant gut microbiome composition at 6 weeks than exposure to peripartum antibiotics.

_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Female, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Pregnancy, Cesarean Section, Adult, Infant, Feces, Delivery, Obstetric, Peripartum Period, Infant, Newborn, Male, Antibiotic Prophylaxis, Longitudinal Studies_
Background. Previous research has shown that delivery mode can shape infant gut microbiome composition. However, mothers delivering by caesarean section routinely receive prophylactic antibiotics prior to delivery, resulting in antibiotic exposure to the infant via the placenta. Previously, only a small number of studies have examined the effect of delivery mode versus antibiotic exposure on the infant gut microbiome with mixed findings.Objective. We aimed to determine the effect of delivery mode compared to antibiotic use during labour and delivery on the infant and maternal gut microbiome at 6 weeks post-partum.Methodology. Twenty-five mother-infant dyads were selected from the longitudinal Queensland Family Cohort Study. The selected dyads comprised nine vaginally delivered infants without antibiotics, seven vaginally delivered infants exposed to antibiotics and nine infants born by caesarean section with routine maternal prophylactic antibiotics. Shotgun-metagenomic sequencing of DNA from stool samples collected at 6 weeks post-partum from mother and infant was used to assess microbiome composition.Results. Caesarean section infants exhibited decreases in Bacteroidetes (ANCOM-BC q&lt;0.0001, MaAsLin 2 q=0.041), changes to several functional pathways and altered beta diversity (R 2=0.056, P=0.029), while minimal differences due to antibiotic exposure were detected. For mothers, caesarean delivery (P=0.0007) and antibiotic use (P=0.016) decreased the evenness of the gut microbiome at 6 weeks post-partum without changing beta diversity. Several taxa in the maternal microbiome were altered in association with antibiotic use, with few differentially abundant taxa associated with delivery mode.Conclusion. For infants, delivery mode appears to have a larger effect on gut microbiome composition at 6 weeks post-partum than intrapartum antibiotic exposure. For mothers, both delivery mode and intrapartum antibiotic use have a small effect on gut microbiome composition at 6 weeks post-partum.

Checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) is a potentially fatal adverse event characterized by new pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study aims to explore the interplay between lung microbiota, dysregulated metabolites, and host immunity in CIP.

## A human commensal-pathogenic fungus suppresses host immunity via targeting TBK1.

Candida albicans stably colonizes humans but is the leading cause of hospital-acquired fungemia. Traditionally, masking immunogenic moieties has been viewed as a tactic for immune evasion. Here, we demonstrate that C. albicans blocks type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling via translocating an effector protein Cmi1 into host cells. Mechanistically, Cmi1 binds and inhibits TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to abrogate IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, thereby suppressing the IFN-I cascade. Murine infection with a cmi1 mutant displays an exaggerated IFN-I response in both kidneys and bone-marrow-derived macrophages, leading to rapid fungal clearance and host survival. Remarkably, the lack of CMI1 compromises gut commensalism and increases IFN-I response in mouse colonic cells. These phenotypes of cmi1 are rescued by the depletion of IFN-I receptor. This work establishes the importance of TBK1 inhibition in fungal pathogenesis and reveals that a human commensal-pathogenic fungus significantly impacts host immunity during gut colonization and infection via delivering effector proteins into host cells.

## Bacterial homologs of innate eukaryotic antiviral defenses with anti-phage activity highlight shared evolutionary roots of viral defenses.

Prokaryotes have evolved a multitude of defense systems to protect against phage predation. Some of these resemble eukaryotic genes involved in antiviral responses. Here, we set out to systematically project the current knowledge of eukaryotic-like antiviral defense systems onto prokaryotic genomes, using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model organism. Searching for phage defense systems related to innate antiviral genes from vertebrates and plants, we uncovered over 450 candidates. We validated six of these phage defense systems, including factors preventing viral attachment, R-loop-acting enzymes, the inflammasome, ubiquitin pathway, and pathogen recognition signaling. Collectively, these defense systems support the concept of deep evolutionary links and shared antiviral mechanisms between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Symbioses between primary producers and bacteria are crucial for nutrient exchange that fosters host growth and niche adaptation. Yet, how viruses that infect bacteria (phages) influence these bacteria-eukaryote interactions is still largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of viruses on the genomic diversity and functional adaptations of bacteria associated with pelagic sargassum. This brown alga has dramatically increased its distribution range in the Atlantic in the past decade and is predicted to continue expanding, imposing severe impacts on coastal ecosystems, economies, and human health.
