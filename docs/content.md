The Arctic and Antarctic are the two most geographically distant bioregions on earth. Recent sampling efforts and following metagenomics have shed light on the global ocean microbial diversity and function, yet the microbiota of polar regions has not been included in such global analyses.

## Gut microbiota from persons with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder affects the brain in mice.

The impact of the gut microbiota on host physiology and behavior has been relatively well established. Whether changes in microbial composition affect brain structure and function is largely elusive, however. This is important as altered brain structure and function have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We hypothesized that gut microbiota of persons with and without ADHD, when transplanted into mice, would differentially modify brain function and/or structure. We investigated this by colonizing young, male, germ-free C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice with microbiota from individuals with and without ADHD. We generated and analyzed microbiome data, assessed brain structure and function by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and studied mouse behavior in a behavioral test battery.

## Lung function and microbiota diversity in cystic fibrosis.
 03.04.2020, _L Cuthbertson, AW Walker, AE Oliver, GB Rogers, DW Rivett, TH Hampton, A Ashare, JS Elborn, A De Soyza, MP Carroll, LR Hoffman, C Lanyon, SM Moskowitz, GA O'Toole, J Parkhill, PJ Planet, CC Teneback, MM Tunney, JB Zuckerman, KD Bruce, CJ van der Gast_


Chronic infection and concomitant airway inflammation is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for people living with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although chronic infection in CF is undeniably polymicrobial, involving a lung microbiota, infection surveillance and control approaches remain underpinned by classical aerobic culture-based microbiology. How to use microbiomics to direct clinical management of CF airway infections remains a crucial challenge. A pivotal step towards leveraging microbiome approaches in CF clinical care is to understand the ecology of the CF lung microbiome and identify ecological patterns of CF microbiota across a wide spectrum of lung disease. Assessing sputum samples from 299 patients attending 13 CF centres in Europe and the USA, we determined whether the emerging relationship of decreasing microbiota diversity with worsening lung function could be considered a generalised pattern of CF lung microbiota and explored its potential as an informative indicator of lung disease state in CF.

## MetaEuk-sensitive, high-throughput gene discovery, and annotation for large-scale eukaryotic metagenomics.
 04.04.2020, _E Levy Karin, M Mirdita, J Söding_


Metagenomics is revolutionizing the study of microorganisms and their involvement in biological, biomedical, and geochemical processes, allowing us to investigate by direct sequencing a tremendous diversity of organisms without the need for prior cultivation. Unicellular eukaryotes play essential roles in most microbial communities as chief predators, decomposers, phototrophs, bacterial hosts, symbionts, and parasites to plants and animals. Investigating their roles is therefore of great interest to ecology, biotechnology, human health, and evolution. However, the generally lower sequencing coverage, their more complex gene and genome architectures, and a lack of eukaryote-specific experimental and computational procedures have kept them on the sidelines of metagenomics.

## Drug-induced vitiligo: A case/non-case study in Vigibase®, the WHO pharmacovigilance database.
 04.04.2020, _N Anthony, D Bourneau-Martin, S Ghamrawi, L Lagarce, M Babin, M Briet_


Vitiligo is a common depigmenting disorder ensuing the loss of epidermal melanocytes. It is a multifactorial disease with immunological, genetic and environmental factors including drug exposure. The purpose of the study was to investigate the drugs and therapeutic subclasses associated with vitiligo occurrence reported in VigiBase®, the WHO pharmacovigilance database. A case/non-case study was carried out by defining cases as vitiligo reports and non-cases as all other reports. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was calculated for the "suspected" drugs and drug classes according to ATC level 4. During the study period, 741 cases of vitiligo were registered. Mean age was 49 ± 20 years. The disproportionality analysis showed an association between vitiligo and pembrolizumab (ROR 116.9, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 94.8, 144.3), nivolumab (ROR 22.6, 95% CI 15.8, 32.4), ipilimumab (ROR 41.7, 95% CI 25.0, 69.7), imiquimod (ROR 152.8, 95% CI 103.0, 226.7), adalimumab (ROR 3.8, 95% CI 2.5,5.8), infliximab (ROR 2.6, 95% CI 1.65, 4.01), alemtuzumab (ROR 27.8, 95% CI 17.6, 43.9), and ustekinumab (ROR 9.3, 95% CI 5.6, 15.6). Concerning the pharmacological classes ATC level 4, a significant association was found with monoclonal antibodies, interferons, selective immunosuppressants, TNF alfa inhibitors, interleukin inhibitors, and topical antivirals. This study confirmed the expected associations between vitiligo and immune check point inhibitors and strengthened the emerging signal about the association between vitiligo and imiquimod, TNF-alpha inhibitors and interferons. New signals were shown with selective immunosuppressants including alemtuzumab and interleukin inhibitors.
