This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

Optimal maternal nutrition is associated with better pregnancy and infant outcomes. Culinary nutrition programmes have potential to improve diet quality during pregnancy. Therefore, this research aimed to understand the experiences of cooking and the wants and needs of pregnant women regarding a cooking and food skills programme in the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland (ROI).

## Pan-genome insights into adaptive evolution of bacterial symbionts in mixed host-microbe symbioses represented by human gut microbiota Bacteroides cellulosilyticus.
 11.04.2024, _Z Yin, J Liang, M Zhang, B Chen, Z Yu, X Tian, X Deng, L Peng_


Animal hosts harbor diverse assemblages of microbial symbionts that play crucial roles in the host's lifestyle. The link between microbial symbiosis and host development remains poorly understood. In particular, little is known about the adaptive evolution of gut bacteria in host-microbe symbioses. Recently, symbiotic relationships have been categorized as open, closed, or mixed, reflecting their modes of inter-host transmission and resulting in distinct genomic features. Members of the genus Bacteroides are the most abundant human gut microbiota and possess both probiotic and pathogenic potential, providing an excellent model for studying pan-genome evolution in symbiotic systems. Here, we determined the complete genome of an novel clinical strain PL2022, which was isolated from a blood sample and performed pan-genome analyses on a representative set of Bacteroides cellulosilyticus strains to quantify the influence of the symbiotic relationship on the evolutionary dynamics. B. cellulosilyticus exhibited correlated genomic features with both open and closed symbioses, suggesting a mixed symbiosis. An open pan-genome is characterized by abundant accessory gene families, potential horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and diverse mobile genetic elements (MGEs), indicating an innovative gene pool, mainly associated with genomic islands and plasmids. However, massive parallel gene loss, weak purifying selection, and accumulation of positively selected mutations were the main drivers of genome reduction in B. cellulosilyticus. Metagenomic read recruitment analyses showed that B. cellulosilyticus members are globally distributed and active in human gut habitats, in line with predominant vertical transmission in the human gut. However, existence and/or high abundance were also detected in non-intestinal tissues, other animal hosts, and non-host environments, indicating occasional horizontal transmission to new niches, thereby creating arenas for the acquisition of novel genes. This case study of adaptive evolution under a mixed host-microbe symbiosis advances our understanding of symbiotic pan-genome evolution. Our results highlight the complexity of genetic evolution in this unusual intestinal symbiont.
