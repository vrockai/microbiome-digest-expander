Transplanting human gut microbiotas into germ-free (GF) mice is a popular approach to disentangle cause-and-effect relationships between enteric microbes and disease. Algorithm development has enabled sequence variant (SV) identification from 16S rRNA gene sequence data. SV analyses can identify which donor taxa colonize recipient GF mice, and how SV abundance in humans is replicated in these mice. Fecal microbiotas from 8 human subjects were used to generate 77 slurries, which were transplanted into 153 GF mice. Strong correlations between fecal and slurry microbial communities were observed; however, only 42.15 ± 9.95% of SVs successfully transferred from the donor to the corresponding recipient mouse. Firmicutes had a particularly low transfer rate and SV abundance was poorly correlated between donor and recipient pairs. Our study confirms human fecal microbiotas colonize formerly GF mice, but the engrafted community only partially resembles the input human communities. Our findings emphasize the importance of reporting a standardized transfer rate and merit the exploration of other animal models or in silico tools to understand the relationships between human gut microbiotas and disease.

## Cesarean delivery is associated with decreased beneficial gut microbes and increased pathobionts and butyrate excretion: a longitudinal study over the first year of life.
 18.12.2020, _NT Mueller, MK Differding, T Østbye, C Hoyo, SE Benjamin-Neelon_


C-section interrupts mother-to-newborn microbial transfer at birth. Beyond the neonatal period, the impact of C-section on offspring gut microbiota and their short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) remains unclear. Here we examine delivery mode (C-section vs. vaginal) with the infant gut microbiota and fecal SCFAs measured 3 and 12 months after birth.

## Future directions for studying resilience of the oral ecosystem.
 21.12.2020, _C Zemouri, ID Ofiteru, NS Jakubovics_


The oral ecosystem is shaped by complex interactions between systemic health disease and the resident oral microbiota. Research in the last two decades has produced datasets describing the genetics and physiology of the host and the oral microbiome in health and disease. There are inter-individual differences in the ability to tolerate oral disease-promoting challenges. Identification of the key factors that drive a healthy and resilient oral ecosystem is urgently needed. So far, progress is being made towards replicating the host-microbiota interplay in vitro. Clinical studies may shed light on the mechanisms of oral health resilience. However, most clinical studies are cross-sectional and are insufficient for understanding resilience or for identifying biomarkers that correlate with the point of transition from oral health to dysbiosis. Mathematical and computational models, including artificial intelligence approaches, offer an opportunity to inform the design of clinical studies by identifying key biomarkers and interaction networks in complex datasets and predicting important parameters. This paper discusses some of the challenges and opportunities for understanding the biological basis of resilience of the oral ecosystem. It discusses the current status and challenges, and proposes a way forward to better understand resilience towards oral diseases.

## Maternal diet alters human milk oligosaccharide composition with implications for the milk metagenome.
 20.12.2020, _MD Seferovic, M Mohammad, RM Pace, M Engevik, J Versalovic, L Bode, M Haymond, KM Aagaard_


Human milk is the optimal nutrition source for infants, and oligosaccharides represent the third most abundant component in milk after lactose and fat. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are favorable macromolecules which are, interestingly, indigestible by the infant but serve as substrates for bacteria. Hypothesizing that the maternal diet itself might influence HMO composition, we sought to directly determine the effect maternal diet on HMO and the milk bacteria. Employing a human cross-over study design, we demonstrate that distinct maternal dietary carbohydrate and energy sources preferentially alter milk concentrations of HMO, including fucosylated species. We find significant associations between the concentration of HMO-bound fucose and the abundance of fucosidase (a bacterial gene that digests fucose moieties) harbored by milk bacteria. These studies reveal a successive mechanism by which the maternal diet during lactation alters milk HMO composition, which in turn shapes the functional milk microbiome prior to infant ingestion.

ROR-γt+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) of the colon can prevent excessive inflammation but also delay pathogen clearance. How these cells are regulated has remained elusive. In this issue of Cell, Ramanan et al. find that the set-point for ROR-γt+ Tregs is non-genetically maternally inherited during a critical time window after birth through immunoglobulin A present in breast milk.

## An Immunologic Mode of Multigenerational Transmission Governs a Gut Treg Setpoint.
 18.12.2020, _D Ramanan, E Sefik, S Galván-Peña, M Wu, L Yang, Z Yang, A Kostic, TV Golovkina, DL Kasper, D Mathis, C Benoist_


At the species level, immunity depends on the selection and transmission of protective components of the immune system. A microbe-induced population of RORγ-expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs) is essential in controlling gut inflammation. We uncovered a non-genetic, non-epigenetic, non-microbial mode of transmission of their homeostatic setpoint. RORγ+ Treg proportions varied between inbred mouse strains, a trait transmitted by the mother during a tight age window after birth but stable for life, resistant to many microbial or cellular perturbations, then further transferred by females for multiple generations. RORγ+ Treg proportions negatively correlated with IgA production and coating of gut commensals, traits also subject to maternal transmission, in an immunoglobulin- and RORγ+ Treg-dependent manner. We propose a model based on a double-negative feedback loop, vertically transmitted via the entero-mammary axis. This immunologic mode of multi-generational transmission may provide adaptability and modulate the genetic tuning of gut immune responses and inflammatory disease susceptibility.

## Microbiome: A Supportive or a Leading Actor in Lung Cancer?
 22.12.2020, _D Martins, F Mendes, F Schmitt_


Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Despite the major diagnostic and therapeutic innovations, the effect on mortality has been modest and the overall survival is still poor. Better understanding of the pathology of these tumors is necessary in order to develop personalized therapeutic strategies in lung cancer patients. Human microbiome has been associated with normal physiology and function, and increasing evidence points towards a key role of the microbiome in promoting the progression of lung disease. Studies have shown that although poorly understood, lung has a distinctive microbiome that may an important role in lung cancer development and progression, and interactions between microbial populations have the potential to influence disease, suggesting that microbiome can be an emerging target in cancer therapeutics. We will review mechanisms how the lung microbiota influences carcinogenesis, focusing on the bacterial dysbiosis and inflammation. Moreover, we will discuss the link between the microbiome and cancer and the consequences induced by the immune system, as the host microbiota plays an essential role in activating and modulating the immune response. We summarize current research advances in the lung microbiome and demonstrate the potential to exploit microbiome as a mechanism to prevent carcinogenesis and modulate therapeutic strategy, suggesting microbiome as a valuable approach in lung cancer patients.

Chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain (CWP) is a characteristic symptom of fibromyalgia, which has been shown to be associated with an altered gut microbiome. Microbiome studies to date have not examined the milder CWP phenotype specifically nor have they explored the role of raised BMI. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the microbiome is abnormal in CWP.

## The Gut Microbiome as a Reservoir for Antimicrobial Resistance.
 16.12.2020, _WE Anthony, CD Burnham, G Dantas, JH Kwon_


This review will discuss the gut as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance, colonization resistance, and how disruption of the microbiome can lead to colonization by pathogenic organisms. There is a focus on the gut as a reservoir for β-lactam and plasmid mediated quinolone resistance. Finally, the role of functional metagenomics and long read sequencing technologies to detect and understand antimicrobial resistance genes within the gut microbiome, and the potential for future microbiome-directed methods to detect and prevent infection is discussed.

## Viral Infection-Induced Gut Dysbiosis, Neuroinflammation, and α-Synuclein Aggregation: Updates and Perspectives on COVID-19 and Neurodegenerative Disorders.
 18.12.2020, _C Follmer_


The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gained increased attention in the neuroscience community, especially taking into account the neuroinvasive potential of its causative agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the impact of its infection on the structure and function of the brain. Apart from the neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2, it is likewise important the observation that virus infection may perturb specific cellular processes that are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of diverse neurological disorders, particularly in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this scenario, viral infection-induced colon inflammation, gut microbial imbalance, and α-synuclein upregulation are of particular interest with regard to the interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (microbiome-gut-brain axis). In this Perspective, we present a critical view on the different hypotheses that are recently being raised by neuroscientists about the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and long-lasting neurodegenerative disorders, opening the question of whether COVID-19 might represent a risk factor for the development of PD.

## Gut Microbiota Status in COVID-19: An Unrecognized Player?

Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes cardiopulmonary and vascular complications, ranging in severity. Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of the novel SARS-CoV2 infection and progression can provide potential novel targets for its prevention and/or treatment. Virus microbiota reciprocal interactions have been studied in a variety of viral infections. For example, the integrity of Coronavirus particles can be disrupted by surfactin, a bacterial surface molecule that targets other viruses, including that of influenza A. In this light, intestinal microbiota likely influences COVID-19 virulence, while from its side SARS-CoV-2 may affect the intestinal microbiome promoting dysbiosis and other deleterious consequences. Hence, the microbiota pre-existing health status and its alterations in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, are likely to play an important, still underscored role in determining individual susceptibility and resilience to COVID-19. Indeed, the vast majority of COVID-19 worst clinical conditions and fatalities develop in subjects with specific risk factors such as aging and the presence of one or more comorbidities, which are intriguingly characterized also by unhealthy microbiome status. Moreover, these comorbidities require complex pharmacological regimens known as "polypharmacy" that may further affect microbiota integrity and worsen the resilience to viral infections. This complex situation may represent a further and underestimated risk with regard to COVID-19 clinical burden for the elderly and comorbid people. Here, we discuss the possible biological, physiopathological, and clinical implications of gut microbiota in COVID-19 and the strategies to improve/maintain its healthy status as a simple and adjunctive strategy to reduce COVID-19 virulence and socio-sanitary burden.
