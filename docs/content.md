There is an unmet need for biomarkers for the diagnosis of lung cancer and decision criteria for lung biopsy. We comparatively investigated the lung microbiomes of patients with lung cancer and benign lung diseases. Patients who underwent bronchoscopy at Chungnam National University Hospital between June 2021 and June 2022 were enrolled. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from 24 patients each with lung cancer and benign lung diseases. The samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA-based metagenomic sequencing. We found that alpha diversity and the beta diversity distribution (P = 0.001) differed significantly between patients with benign lung diseases and those with lung cancer. Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in patients with lung cancer (33.39% ± 17.439), whereas Bacteroidota was the most abundant phylum in patients with benign lung disease (31.132% ± 22.505), respectively. In differential abundance analysis, the most differentially abundant microbiota taxon was unclassified_SAR202_clade, belonging to the phylum Chloroflexi. The established prediction model distinguished patients with benign lung disease from those with lung cancer with a high accuracy (micro area under the curve [AUC] = 0.98 and macro AUC = 0.99). The BALF microbiome may be a novel biomarker for the detection of lung cancer.

Gut microbiota has been implicated in various clinical conditions, yet the substantial heterogeneity in gut microbiota research results necessitates a more sophisticated approach than merely identifying statistically different microbial taxa between healthy and unhealthy individuals. Our study seeks to not only select microbial taxa but also explore their synergy with phenotypic host variables to develop novel predictive models for specific clinical conditions.

## The Gut Microbiome Affects Atherosclerosis by Regulating Reverse Cholesterol Transport.
 17.01.2024, _Y Jiang, S Pang, X Liu, L Wang, Y Liu_


The human system's secret organ, the gut microbiome, has received considerable attention. Emerging research has yielded substantial scientific evidence indicating that changes in gut microbial composition and microbial metabolites may contribute to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The burden of cardiovascular disease on healthcare systems is exacerbated by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which continues to be the leading cause of mortality globally. Reverse cholesterol transport is a powerful protective mechanism that effectively prevents excessive accumulation of cholesterol for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It has been revealed how the gut microbiota modulates reverse cholesterol transport in patients with atherosclerotic risk. In this review, we highlight the complex interactions between microbes, their metabolites, and their potential impacts in reverse cholesterol transport. We also explore the feasibility of modulating gut microbes and metabolites to facilitate reverse cholesterol transport as a novel therapy for atherosclerosis.

Early life represents a critical window for metabolic, cognitive and immune system development, which is influenced by the maternal microbiome as well as the infant gut microbiome. Antibiotic exposure, mode of delivery and breastfeeding practices modulate the gut microbiome and the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Vertical and horizontal microbial gene transfer during early life and the mechanisms behind these transfers are being uncovered. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the transfer of antibiotic resistance in the mother-infant dyad through vertical and horizontal transmission and to highlight the main gaps and challenges in this area.

## Complement in breast milk modifies offspring gut microbiota to promote infant health.
 19.01.2024, _D Xu, S Zhou, Y Liu, AL Scott, J Yang, F Wan_


Breastfeeding offers demonstrable benefits to newborns and infants by providing nourishment and immune protection and by shaping the gut commensal microbiota. Although it has been appreciated for decades that breast milk contains complement components, the physiological relevance of complement in breast milk remains undefined. Here, we demonstrate that weanling mice fostered by complement-deficient dams rapidly succumb when exposed to murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (CR), whereas pups fostered on complement-containing milk complement components in breast milk were shown to directly lyse specific members of gram-positive gut commensal microbiota via a C1-dependent, antibody-independent mechanism, resulting in the deposition of the membrane attack complex and subsequent bacterial lysis. By selectively eliminating members of the commensal gut community, complement components from breast milk shape neonate and infant gut microbial composition to be protective against environmental pathogens such as CR.

## An Oral Nanomedicine Elicits In Situ Vaccination Effect against Colorectal Cancer.
 19.01.2024, _M Zu, Y Ma, J Zhang, J Sun, MA Shahbazi, G Pan, RL Reis, SC Kundu, J Liu, B Xiao_


Oral administration is the most preferred approach for treating colon diseases, and in situ vaccination has emerged as a promising cancer therapeutic strategy. However, the lack of effective drug delivery platforms hampered the application of in situ vaccination strategy in oral treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we construct an oral core-shell nanomedicine by preparing a silk fibroin-based dual sonosensitizer (chlorin e6, Ce6)- and immunoadjuvant (imiquimod, R837)-loaded nanoparticle as the core, with its surface coated with plant-extracted lipids and pluronic F127 (p127). The resultant nanomedicines (Ce6/R837@Lp127NPs) maintain stability during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract and exert improved locomotor activities under ultrasound irradiation, achieving efficient colonic mucus infiltration and specific tumor penetration. Thereafter, Ce6/R837@Lp127NPs induce immunogenic death of colorectal tumor cells by sonodynamic treatment, and the generated neoantigens in the presence of R837 serve as a potent in situ vaccine. By integrating with immune checkpoint blockades, the combined treatment modality inhibits orthotopic tumors, eradicates distant tumors, and modulates intestinal microbiota. As the first oral in situ vaccination, this work spotlights a robust oral nanoplatform for producing a personalized vaccine against CRC.

## Bacterial community and diversity in the rumen of 11 Mongolian cattle as revealed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.
 21.01.2024, _Y Jia, Y Shi, H Qiao_

Through microorganism in the rumen of ruminant, plant fiber can be converted to edible food such as meat and milk. Ruminants had a rich and complex microbial community within the rumen, and the bacteria comprised the dominant proportion of the ruminal microbes. High-throughput sequencing offered a viable solution for the study of rumen microbes. In this study, rumen fluid samples were taken from 11 cattle from Inner Mongolian, the DNA of 11 rumen fluid samples were extracted and bacterial amplicons of the V4 regions of 16S rRNA were subjected to Illumina sequencing. More than 90,000 raw reads and 60,000 effect Tags per sample were obtained. 28,122 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were observed from 11 samples, in average 2557 ± 361 OTUs for each sample. Bacteroidetes (44.41 ± 7.31%), Firmicutes (29.07 ± 3.78%), and Proteobacteria (7.18 ± 5.63%) were the dominant phyla among the bacteria of rumen, accounting for 82%. At the genus level, the highest relative abundance was Prevotella. Their functions were predicted using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The results showed that they included metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing and cellular processes. It explored the bacterial community diversity and composition of the rumen of Mongolian cattle. On the whole, our research showed that there was a high diversity as well as rich bacterial flora function of rumen bacteria in Mongolian cattle. Meanwhile, these findings provided information for further studies on the relationship between the community, diversity, functions of rumen bacteria and the nutritional physiological functions of the host.

_Mycorrhizae, Symbiosis, Plant Roots, Plants, Bacteria, Soil_
Plant microbiomes play crucial roles in nutrient cycling and plant growth, and are shaped by a complex interplay between plants, microbes, and the environment. The role of bacteria as mediators of the 400-million-year-old partnership between the majority of land plants and, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is still poorly understood. Here, we test whether AM hyphae-associated bacteria influence the success of the AM symbiosis.

_Soil, Genome-Wide Association Study, Seeds, Microbiota, Plants, Endophytes, Genotype, Bacteria_
Fonio (Digitaria exilis), an orphan millet crop, is the oldest indigenous crop in West Africa. Although the yield is low due to pre-domestication characteristics, the quick maturation time, drought tolerance, and the ability to thrive on poor soils make fonio a climate-smart crop. Being holobionts, plants evolve in close interaction with microbial partners, which is crucial for plant phenology and fitness. As seeds are the bottleneck of vertically transmitting plant microbiota, we proposed to unravel the seed microbiome of the under-domesticated and resilient crop fonio. Our study investigated the bacterial seed endophyte diversity across 126 sequenced fonio accessions from distinct locations in West Africa. We conducted a correlation study of the structures and functions of the seed-associated microbiomes with the native geo-climate and soil structure data. We also performed Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic loci associated with seed endophyte diversity.

## The role of plants in ironstone evolution: iron and aluminium cycling in the rhizosphere.
 19.01.2024, _A Paz, EJ Gagen, A Levett, MWM Jones, PM Kopittke, G Southam_


The Carajás plateaus in Brazil host endemic epilithic vegetation ("campo rupestre") on top of ironstone duricrusts, known as canga. This capping rock is primarily composed of iron(III) oxide minerals and forms a physically resistant horizon. Field observations reveal an intimate interaction between canga's surface and two native sedges (Rhynchospora barbata and Bulbostylis cangae). These observations suggest that certain plants contribute to the biogeochemical cycling of iron. Iron dissolution features at the root-rock interface were characterised using synchrotron-based techniques, Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. These microscale characterisations indicate that iron is preferentially leached in the rhizosphere, enriching the comparatively insoluble aluminium around root channels. Oxalic acid and other exudates were detected in active root channels, signifying ligand-controlled iron oxide dissolution, likely driven by the plants' requirements for goethite-associated nutrients such as phosphorus. The excess iron not uptaken by the plant can reprecipitate in and around roots, line root channels and cement detrital fragments in the soil crust at the base of the plants. The reprecipitation of iron is significant as it provides a continuously forming cement, which makes canga horizons a 'self-healing' cover and contributes to them being the world's most stable continuously exposed land surfaces. Aluminium hydroxide precipitates ("gibbsite cutans") were also detected, coating some of the root cavities, often in alternating layers with goethite. This alternating pattern may correspond with oscillating oxygen concentrations in the rhizosphere. Microbial lineages known to contain iron-reducing bacteria were identified in the sedge rhizospheric microbiome and likely contribute to the reductive dissolution of iron(III) oxides within canga. Drying or percolation of oxygenated water to these anaerobic niches have led to iron mineralisation of biofilms, detected in many root channels. This study sheds light on plants' direct and indirect involvement in canga evolution, with possible implications for revegetation and surface restoration of iron mine sites.

## Consistent effects of independent domestication events on the plant microbiota.

The effect of plant domestication on plant-microbe interactions remains difficult to prove. In this study, we provide evidence of a domestication effect on the composition and abundance of the plant microbiota. We focused on the genus Phaseolus, which underwent four independent domestication events within two species (P. vulgaris and P. lunatus), providing multiple replicates of a process spanning thousands of years. We targeted Phaseolus seeds to identify a link between domesticated traits and bacterial community composition as Phaseolus seeds have been subject to large and consistent phenotypic changes during these independent domestication events. The seed bacterial communities of representative plant accessions from subpopulations descended from each domestication event were analyzed under controlled and field conditions. The results showed that independent domestication events led to similar seed bacterial community signatures in independently domesticated plant populations, which could be partially explained by selection for common domesticated plant phenotypes. Our results therefore provide evidence of a consistent effect of plant domestication on seed microbial community composition and abundance and offer avenues for applying knowledge of the impact of plant domestication on the plant microbiota to improve microbial applications in agriculture.

## New insights into inhibition of high Fe(III) content on anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge.
 19.01.2024, _X Wang, Y Gong, C Sun, Z Wang, Y Sun, Q Yu, Y Zhang_


The impacts of the increased iron in the waste-activated sludge (WAS) on its anaerobic digestion were investigated. It was found that low Fe(III) content (&lt; 750 mg/L) promoted WAS anaerobic digestion, while the continual increase of Fe(III) inhibited CH4 production and total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal. As the Fe(III) content increased to 1470 mg/L, methane production has been slightly inhibited about 5 % compared with the group containing 35 mg/L Fe(III). Particularly, as Fe(III) concentration was up to 2900 mg/L, CH4 production, and TCOD removal decreased by 43.6 % and 37.5 %, respectively, compared with the group with 35 mg/L Fe(III). Furthermore, the percentage of CO2 of the group with 2900 mg/L Fe(III) decreased by 52.8 % compared with the group containing 35 mg/L Fe(III). It indicated that Fe(II) generated by the dissimilatory iron reduction might cause CO2 consumption, which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction that siderite (FeCO3) was generated in the group with 2900 mg/L Fe(III). Further study revealed that Fe(III) promoted the WAS solubilization and hydrolysis, but inhibited acidification and methane production. The methanogenesis test with H2/CO2 as a substrate showed that CO2 consumption weakened hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and then increased H2 partial pressure, further causing VFA accumulation. Microbial community analysis indicated that the abundance of hydrogen-utilizing methanogens decreased with the high Fe(III) content. Our study suggested that the increase of Fe(III) in sludge might inhibit methanogenesis by consuming or precipitating CO2. To achieve maximum bioenergy conversion, the iron content should be controlled to lower than 750 mg/L. The study may provide new insights into the mechanistic understanding of the inhibition of high Fe(III) content on the anaerobic digestion of WAS.

_Silica Gel, DNA, Microbiota, Soil, Ethanol_
Soil sampling for environmental DNA in remote and semi-remote locations is often limited due to logistical constraints surrounding sample preservation, including no or limited access to a freezer. Freezing at - 20 °C is a common DNA preservation strategy, however, other methods such as desiccation, ethanol or commercial preservatives are available as potential alternative DNA preservation methods for room temperature storage. In this study, we assessed five preservation methods (CD1 solution, 95% Ethanol, Dry &amp; Dry silica gel packs, RNAlater, LifeGuard) along with freezing at - 20 °C, against immediate extraction on organic and mineral soils for up to three weeks of preservation. We assessed direct effects on DNA concentration and quality, and used DNA metabarcoding to assess effects on bacterial and fungal communities. Drying with Dry &amp; Dry led to no significant differences from immediate extraction. RNAlater led to lower DNA concentrations, but effects on community structures were comparable to freezing. CD1, LifeGuard and Ethanol either caused immediate significant shifts in community structure, degradation of DNA quality or changes in diversity metrics. Overall, our study supports the use of drying with silica gel packs as a cost-effective, and easily applied method for the short-term storage at room temperature for DNA-based microbial community analyses.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing comprehensively samples the DNA of a microbial sample. Choosing the best bioinformatics processing package can be daunting due to the wide variety of tools available. Here, we assessed publicly available shotgun metagenomics processing packages/pipelines including bioBakery, Just a Microbiology System (JAMS), Whole metaGenome Sequence Assembly V2 (WGSA2), and Woltka using 19 publicly available mock community samples and a set of five constructed pathogenic gut microbiome samples. Also included is a workflow for labelling bacterial scientific names with NCBI taxonomy identifiers for better resolution in assessing results. The Aitchison distance, a sensitivity metric, and total False Positive Relative Abundance were used for accuracy assessments for all pipelines and mock samples. Overall, bioBakery4 performed the best with most of the accuracy metrics, while JAMS and WGSA2, had the highest sensitivities. Furthermore, bioBakery is commonly used and only requires a basic knowledge of command line usage. This work provides an unbiased assessment of shotgun metagenomics packages and presents results assessing the performance of the packages using mock community sequence data.

While various mechanisms through which the microbiome influences disease processes in the host have been identified, there are still only few approaches that allow for targeted manipulation of microbiome composition as a first step toward microbiome-based therapies. Here, we propose the concept of precision prebiotics that allow to boost the abundance of already resident health-beneficial microbial species in a microbiome. We present a constraint-based modeling pipeline to predict precision prebiotics for a minimal microbial community in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans comprising the host-beneficial Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 with the aim to boost the growth of MYb11. Experimentally testing four of the predicted precision prebiotics, we confirm that they are specifically able to increase the abundance of MYb11 in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that constraint-based modeling could be an important tool for the development of targeted microbiome-based therapies against human diseases.
