Intestinal fibrosis is the primary cause of disability in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), yet effective therapeutic strategies are currently lacking. Here, we report a multiomics analysis of gut microbiota and fecal/blood metabolites of 278 CD patients and 28 healthy controls, identifying characteristic alterations in gut microbiota (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Muribaculaceae, Saccharimonadales) and metabolites (e.g., L-aspartic acid, glutamine, ethylmethylacetic acid) in moderate-severe intestinal fibrosis. By integrating multiomics data with magnetic resonance enterography features, putative links between microbial metabolites and intestinal fibrosis-associated morphological alterations were established. These potential associations were mediated by specific combinations of amino acids (e.g., L-aspartic acid), primary bile acids, and glutamine. Finally, we provided causal evidence that L-aspartic acid aggravated intestinal fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, we offer a biologically plausible explanation for the hypothesis that gut microbiota and its metabolites promote intestinal fibrosis in CD while also identifying potential targets for therapeutic trials.

## Bioinformatics challenges for profiling the microbiome in cancer: pitfalls and opportunities.
 13.09.2024, _NA Bokulich, MS Robeson_


Increasing evidence suggests that the human microbiome plays an important role in cancer risk and treatment. Untargeted 'omics' techniques have accelerated research into microbiome-cancer interactions, supporting the discovery of novel associations and mechanisms. However, these techniques require careful selection and use to avoid biases and other pitfalls. In this essay, we discuss selected challenges involved in the analysis of microbiome data in the context of cancer, including the application of machine learning (ML). We focus on DNA sequencing-based (e.g., metagenomics) methods, but many of the pitfalls and opportunities generalize to other omics technologies as well. We advocate for extended training opportunities, community standards, and best practices for sharing data and code to advance transparency and reproducibility in cancer microbiome research.
