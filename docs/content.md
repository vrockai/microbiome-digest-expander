## The link between the gut microbiome, inflammation, and Parkinson's disease.
 22.09.2023, _S Nie, Y Ge_


As our society ages, the growing number of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) puts tremendous pressure on our society. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PD, so there is an urgent need to find new treatment options. In recent years, increasing studies have shown a strong link between gut microbes and PD. In this review, recent advances in research on gut microbes in PD patients were summarized. Increased potential pro-inflammatory microbes and decreased potential anti-inflammatory microbes are prominent features of gut microbiota in PD patients. These changes may lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory substances (such as lipopolysaccharide and H2S) and a decrease in anti-inflammatory substances (such as short-chain fatty acids) to promote inflammation in the gut. This gut microbiota-mediated inflammation will lead to pathological α-synuclein accumulation in the gut, and the inflammation and α-synuclein can spread to the brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, thereby promoting neuroinflammation, apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons, and ultimately the development of PD. This review also showed that therapies based on gut microbiota may have a bright future for PD. However, more research and new approaches are still needed to clarify the causal relationship between gut microbes and PD and to determine whether therapies based on gut microbiota are effective in PD patients. KEY POINTS: • There is a strong association between gut microbes and PD. • Inflammation mediated by gut microbes may promote the development of PD. • Therapies based on the gut microbiome provide a promising strategy for PD prevention.

## The edible plant microbiome: evidence for the occurrence of fruit and vegetable bacteria in the human gut.
 26.09.2023, _WA Wicaksono, T Cernava, B Wassermann, A Abdelfattah, MJ Soto-Giron, GV Toledo, SM Virtanen, M Knip, H Hyöty, G Berg_


_Humans, Vegetables, Plants, Edible, Fruit, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Microbiota, Bacteria_
Diversity of the gut microbiota is crucial for human health. However, whether fruit and vegetable associated bacteria contribute to overall gut bacterial diversity is still unknown. We reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes from 156 fruit and vegetable metagenomes to investigate the prevalence of associated bacteria in 2,426 publicly available gut metagenomes. The microbiomes of fresh fruits and vegetables and the human gut are represented by members in common such as Enterobacterales, Burkholderiales, and Lactobacillales. Exposure to bacteria via fruit and vegetable consumption potentially has a beneficial impact on the functional diversity of gut microbiota particularly due to the presence of putative health-promoting genes for the production of vitamin and short-chain fatty acids. In the human gut, they were consistently present, although at a low abundance, approx. 2.2%. Host age, vegetable consumption frequency, and the diversity of plants consumed were drivers favoring a higher proportion. Overall, these results provide one of the primary links between the human microbiome and the environmental microbiome. This study revealed evidence that fruit and vegetable-derived microbes could be found in the human gut and contribute to gut microbiome diversity.

## Reducing gut microbiome-driven adipose tissue inflammation alleviates metabolic syndrome.

_Animals, Mice, Metabolic Syndrome, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Adipose Tissue, Obesity, Inflammation_
The gut microbiota contributes to macrophage-mediated inflammation in adipose tissue with consumption of an obesogenic diet, thus driving the development of metabolic syndrome. There is a need to identify and develop interventions that abrogate this condition. The hops-derived prenylated flavonoid xanthohumol (XN) and its semi-synthetic derivative tetrahydroxanthohumol (TXN) attenuate high-fat diet-induced obesity, hepatosteatosis, and metabolic syndrome in C57Bl/6J mice. This coincides with a decrease in pro-inflammatory gene expression in the gut and adipose tissue, together with alterations in the gut microbiota and bile acid composition.

## Unfolding the secrets of microbiome (Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria) in cold-water coral.
 21.09.2023, _S Gong, J Liang, X Jin, L Xu, M Zhao, K Yu_


Recent deep-ocean exploration has uncovered a variety of cold-water coral (CWC) ecosystems around the world ocean, but it remains unclear how microbiome is associated with these corals at a molecular levels. This study utilized metabarcoding, tissue section observation, and metatranscriptomes to investigate the microbiome (Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria) of CWC species (Narella versluysi, Heterogorgia uatumani, and Muriceides sp.) from depths ranging from 260 m to 370 m. Warm-water coral (WWC) species (Acropora pruinosa, Pocillopora damicornis, and Galaxea fascicularis) were used as control groups. Results revealed that CWC host diverse bacteria and Symbiodiniaceae cells were observed in endoderm of CWC tissues. Several new candidate bacterial phyla were found in both CWC and WWC, including Coralsanbacteria, Coralqiangbacteria, Coralgsqaceae, Coralgongineae, etc. Both the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metatranscriptomes revealed that Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were abundant bacterial phyla in CWC. At the gene transcription level, the CWC-associated Symbiodiniaceae community showed a low-level transcription of genes involved in photosynthesis, CO2 fixation, glycolysis, citric acid cycle, while bacteria associated with CWC exhibited a high-level transcription of genes for carbon fixation via the Wood-Lijungdahl pathway, short chain fatty acids production, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. IMPORTANCE This study shed new light on the functions of both Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria in cold-water coral (CWC). The results demonstrated that Symbiodiniaceae can survive and actively transcribe genes in CWC, suggesting a possible symbiotic or parasitic relationship with the host. This study also revealed complete non-photosynthetic CO2 fixation pathway of bacteria in CWC, as well as their roles in short chain fatty acids production and assimilation of host-derived organic nitrogen and sulfur. These findings highlight the important role of bacteria in the carbon, nitrogen sulfur cycles in CWC, which were possibly crucial for CWC survival in in deep-water environments.

## The pivotal roles of gut microbiota in insect plant interactions for sustainable pest management.
 25.09.2023, _Y Zhang, S Zhang, L Xu_


_Animals, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Insecta_
The gut microbiota serves as a critical "organ" in the life cycle of animals, particularly in the intricate interplay between herbivorous pests and plants. This review summarizes the pivotal functions of the gut microbiota in mediating the insect-plant interactions, encompassing their influence on host insects, modulation of plant physiology, and regulation of the third trophic level species within the ecological network. Given these significant functions, it is plausible to harness these interactions and their underlying mechanisms to develop novel eco-friendly pest control strategies. In this context, we also outline some emerging pest control methods based on the intestinal microbiota or bacteria-mediated interactions, such as symbiont-mediated RNAi and paratransgenesis, albeit these are still in their nascent stages and confront numerous challenges. Overall, both opportunities and challenges coexist in the exploration of the intestinal microbiota-mediated interactions between insect pests and plants, which will not only enrich the fundamental knowledge of plant-insect interactions but also facilitate the development of sustainable pest control strategies.

## Endophytes Modulate Plant Genes: Present Status and Future Perspectives.
 25.09.2023, _V Kumar, CS Nautiyal_


_Genes, Plant, Endophytes, Genomics, Microbiota, Plant Development_
Interactions among endophytes and plants are widespread and can vary from neutral or positive or negative. Plants are continually in a functionally dynamic state due to interactions with diverse endophytic microorganisms, which produce various metabolic substances. Through quorum sensing, these substances not only help endophytes to outcompete other host-associated pathogens or microbes but also allow them to overcome the plant immune system. Manifold interactions between endophytic microbiota cause a reflective impact on the host plant functioning and the development of 'endobiomes,' by synthesizing chemicals that fill the gap between host and endophytes. Despite the advances in the field, specific mechanisms for the endophytes' precise methods to modulate plant genome and their effects on host plants remain poorly understood. Deeper genomic exploration can provide a locked away understanding of the competencies of endophytes and their conceivable function in host growth and health. Endophytes also can modify host metabolites, which could manipulate plants' growth, adaptation, and proliferation, and can be a more exciting and puzzling topic that must be properly investigated. The consequence of the interaction of endophytes on the host genome was analyzed as it can help unravel the gray areas of endophytes about which very little or no knowledge exists. This review discusses the recent advances in understanding the future challenges in the emerging research investigating how endosymbionts affect the host's metabolism and gene expression as an effective strategy for imparting resistance to biotic and abiotic challenges.
