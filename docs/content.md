## Gut microbiota and old age: Modulating factors and interventions for healthy longevity.
 26.09.2020, _V Coman, DC Vodnar_


Our gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic ecosystem with a paramount role in shaping our metabolic and immunological functions. Recent research suggests that aging may negatively affect the composition, diversity, and function of our microbiota mainly due to alterations in diet and immunologic reactivity (i.e. immunosenescence), and increased incidence of certain diseases and, therefore, increased exposure to certain medication (e.g. antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors). In turn, this aging-related gut dysbiosis may contribute to the initiation and/or progress of other metabolic diseases, and consequently, to a decrease in healthy longevity. On the positive side, promising therapeutic interventions, such as diet supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation, aimed to counteract these aging-related deleterious consequences, could improve our health, and extend our healthy lifespan. In this context, the current review aims to assess the latest progress in identifying the key elements affecting the gut microbiota of the older adults and their mechanism of action, and the effectiveness of the therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring the diversity and healthy functions of the gut microbiota in older individuals.

## Role of Gut Microbiome and Microbial Metabolites in Alleviating Insulin Resistance After Bariatric Surgery.
 25.09.2020, _M Wang, L Li, Y Chen, G Lian, J Wang, J Zhang, K Shan, L Shang, F Tian, C Jing_


Insulin resistance (IR) is the most common pathophysiological change in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several recent studies have suggested that the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites are involved in the pathogenesis of IR. Bariatric surgery, as an effective treatment for T2DM, can markedly alleviate IR through mechanisms that have not been elucidated. In this review, we summarize the current evidence on the changes in the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites (including lipopolysaccharide, short-chain fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, bile acids, methylamines, and indole derivatives) after bariatric surgery. Additionally, we discuss the mechanisms that correlate the changes in microbial metabolites with the postoperative alleviation of IR. Furthermore, we discuss the prospect of bariatric surgery as a treatment for T2DM.

## Effects of β-Lactam Antibiotics on Gut Microbiota Colonization and Metabolites in Late Preterm Infants.
 24.09.2020, _S Lu, Q Huang, B Wei, Y Chen_


We usually refer to the critical period for intestinal flora establishment as infancy because the infant gut microbiota is characterized by low diversity and poor stability compared with that of adults. Moreover, it is also vulnerable to interference from a variety of factors. As β-lactam antibiotics are typically used in newborn infants with infectious diseases, we used 16S rDNA sequencing and LC-MS metabolomics to analyze fecal microbes and metabolites in 16 late preterm infants with or without β-lactam antibiotic treatment. The subjects were assigned to two groups: one not treated with antibiotics and another receiving β-lactam antibiotic treatment for less than seven days. Significant changes in fecal microbes and metabolites were observed in the late preterm infants treated with antibiotics, including a reduction in the diversity of the gut microbiota overall and some beneficial bacteria such as Bacteroides, whereas some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus showed an overgrowth trend. In addition, significant changes in some crucial metabolites were observed, such as amino acids and bile acids. These findings show that treatment with β-lactam antibiotics might affect the intestinal flora and its metabolites in late preterm infants in a short time period.

## Review article: how the intestinal microbiota may reflect disease activity and influence therapeutic outcome in inflammatory bowel disease.
 24.09.2020, _C Caenepeel, N Sadat Seyed Tabib, S Vieira-Silva, S Vermeire_


Intestinal bacteria produce metabolites and by-products necessary for homeostasis. Imbalance in this equilibrium is linked with multiple pathologies, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The role of the gut microbiota in determining treatment response is becoming apparent, and may act as biomarker for efficacy.

Recently, the oral microbiome has been found to be associated with oral and general health status. Although various oral sample collection protocols are available, the potential differences between the results yielded by these protocols remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of different time points and methods of oral sample collection on the outcomes of microbiome analysis.

## Microbiome Understanding in Maternity Study (MUMS), an Australian prospective longitudinal cohort study of maternal and infant microbiota: study protocol.
 16.09.2020, _D Susic, G Davis, AJ O' Sullivan, E McGovern, K Harris, LM Roberts, ME Craig, G Mangos, GL Hold, EM El-Omar, A Henry_


Pregnancy induces significant physiological and cardiometabolic changes, and is associated with alterations in the maternal microbiota. Increasing rates of prepregnancy obesity, metabolic abnormalities and reduced physical activity, all impact negatively on the microbiota causing an imbalance between the commensal microorganisms (termed dysbiosis), which may drive complications, such as gestational diabetes or hypertensive disorders. Considerable work is needed to define the inter-relationships between the microbiome, nutrition, physical activity and pregnancy outcomes. The role of the microbiota during pregnancy remains unclear. The aim of the study is to define microbiota signatures longitudinally throughout pregnancy and the first year post birth, and to identify key clinical and environmental variables that shape the female microbiota profile during and following pregnancy.

## Bio-organic fertilizers stimulate indigenous soil Pseudomonas populations to enhance plant disease suppression.
 24.09.2020, _C Tao, R Li, W Xiong, Z Shen, S Liu, B Wang, Y Ruan, S Geisen, Q Shen, GA Kowalchuk_


Plant diseases caused by fungal pathogen result in a substantial economic impact on the global food and fruit industry. Application of organic fertilizers supplemented with biocontrol microorganisms (i.e. bioorganic fertilizers) has been shown to improve resistance against plant pathogens at least in part due to impacts on the structure and function of the resident soil microbiome. However, it remains unclear whether such improvements are driven by the specific action of microbial inoculants, microbial populations naturally resident to the organic fertilizer or the physical-chemical properties of the compost substrate. The aim of this study was to seek the ecological mechanisms involved in the disease suppressive activity of bio-organic fertilizers.

## Breeding selection imposed a differential selective pressure on the wheat root-associated microbiome.
 24.09.2020, _M Kinnunen-Grubb, R Sapkota, M Vignola, IM Nunes, M Nicolaisen_


Plants-microbiome associations are the result of millions of years of co-evolution. Due to breeding-accelerated plant evolution in non-native and highly managed soil, plant-microbe links could have been lost. We hypothesized that post-domestication breeding of wheat changed the root-associated microbiome. To test this, we analyzed root-associated fungal and bacterial communities shortly after emergence of seedlings representing a transect of wheat evolution including modern wheat, landraces, and ancestors. Numbers of observed microbial taxa were highest in landraces bred in low-input agricultural systems, and lowest in ancestors that had evolved in native soils. The microbial communities of modern cultivars were different from those of landraces and ancestors. Old wheat accessions enriched Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria, while modern cultivars enriched OTUs from Candidatus Saccharibacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Firmicutes. The fungal pathogens Fusarium, Neoascochyta and Microdochium enriched in modern cultivars. Both bacterial and fungal communities followed a neutral assembly model when bulk soil was considered as the source community, but accessions of the ancient Triticum turgidum and T. monococcum created a more isolated environment in their roots. In conclusion, wheat root-associated microbiomes have dramatically changed through a transect of breeding history.

## Temporal dynamics of bacterial communities during seed development and maturation.
 23.09.2020, _G Chesneau, G Torres-Cortes, M Briand, A Darrasse, A Preveaux, C Marais, MA Jacques, A Shade, M Barret_


Seed microbiota acts as a starting point for the assembly of the plant microbiota and contributes to successful plant establishment. To date, the order and timing of microbial taxa immigration during seed development and maturation remained unknown. We investigated the temporal dynamics of seed bacterial communities in bean and radish. A high phylogenetic turnover was observed for both plant species with few taxa associated with all seed developmental stages. Greater heterogeneity in community structure within each stage was observed for radish. While about one-third of radish seed bacterial taxa were detected in buds, flowers and fruits, very few taxa seem to be transmitted by the floral route in bean. In the latter species, bacterial populations belonging to the P. fluorescens species complex were found either in buds, flowers and fruits or in seeds. The relative phylogenetic proximity of these bacterial populations combined with their habitat specificity led us to explore the genetic determinants involved in successful seed transmission in bean. Comparative genomic analyses of representatives bacterial strains revealed dozens of coding sequences specifically associated with seed-transmitted strains. This study provided a first glimpse on processes involved in seed microbiota assembly, which could be used for designing plant-beneficial microbial consortia.

## Comparative analysis of rhizosphere soil physiochemical characteristics and microbial communities between rusty and healthy ginseng root.
 28.09.2020, _X Bian, S Xiao, Y Zhao, Y Xu, H Yang, L Zhang_


Ginseng rusty root (GRR) symptom is one of the primary diseases of ginseng. There has been a problem of ginseng rusty root, leading to a severe decline in the quality of ginseng. To clarify the relationship between root symptoms of ginseng rust and soil, the physical and chemical properties, enzyme activity, community structure and microbial diversity of GRR and healthy ginseng (HG) rhizosphere soil were analyzed and compared. The pH and redox potential (Eh) of GRR soil decreased, and the contents of total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) decreased. The activity of catalase and phosphatase and invertase was lower than that of HG groups. Besides, the microbial community of GRR rhizosphere soil changes much, and its abundance and diversity are significantly reduced. The community structure of GRR rhizosphere soil also shows apparent differences, and the samples of the HG group gathered together, and the samples of the GRR group were dispersed. In general, GRR was closely associated with decreases in soil pH and Eh; decreases in TP, AP, and AK; decreases in the activity of several enzymes. Additionally, it is strongly associated with an increase in pathogenic microorganisms such as Ilyonectria and a reduction of beneficial microorganisms such as Tremellomycetes Acidobacteria subgroup 6 and Gemmatimonadetes.

## Community, Distribution, and Ecological Roles of Estuarine Archaea.
 28.09.2020, _D Zou, H Liu, M Li_


Archaea are diverse and ubiquitous prokaryotes present in both extreme and moderate environments. Estuaries, serving as links between the land and ocean, harbor numerous microbes that are relatively highly active because of massive terrigenous input of nutrients. Archaea account for a considerable portion of the estuarine microbial community. They are diverse and play key roles in the estuarine biogeochemical cycles. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are an abundant aquatic archaeal group in estuaries, greatly contributing estuarine ammonia oxidation. Bathyarchaeota are abundant in sediments, and they may involve in sedimentary organic matter degradation, acetogenesis, and, potentially, methane metabolism, based on genomics. Other archaeal groups are also commonly detected in estuaries worldwide. They include Euryarchaeota, and members of the DPANN and Asgard archaea. Based on biodiversity surveys of the 16S rRNA gene and some functional genes, the distribution and abundance of estuarine archaea are driven by physicochemical factors, such as salinity and oxygen concentration. Currently, increasing amount of genomic information for estuarine archaea is becoming available because of the advances in sequencing technologies, especially for AOA and Bathyarchaeota, leading to a better understanding of their functions and environmental adaptations. Here, we summarized the current knowledge on the community composition and major archaeal groups in estuaries, focusing on AOA and Bathyarchaeota. We also highlighted the unique genomic features and potential adaptation strategies of estuarine archaea, pointing out major unknowns in the field and scope for future research.

## Aerobic microbial communities in the sediments of a marine oxygen minimum zone.
 25.09.2020, _S Bhattacharya, C Roy, S Mandal, J Sarkar, MJ Rameez, N Mondal, T Mapder, S Chatterjee, P Pyne, M Alam, PK Haldar, R Roy, S Fernandes, A Peketi, R Chakraborty, A Mazumdar, W Ghosh_


The ecology of aerobic microorganisms is never explored in marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) sediments. Here we reveal aerobic bacterial communities along ∼3 m sediment-horizons of the eastern Arabian Sea OMZ. Sulfide-containing sediment-cores retrieved from 530 mbsl (meters beneath the sea-level) and 580 mbsl were explored at 15-30 cm intervals, using metagenomics, pure-culture-isolation, genomics and metatranscriptomics. Genes for aerobic respiration, and oxidation of methane/ammonia/alcohols/thiosulfate/sulfite/organosulfur-compounds, were detected in the metagenomes from all 25 sediment-samples explored. Most probable numbers for aerobic chemolithoautotrophs and chemoorganoheterotrophs at individual sample-sites were up to 1.1 × 107 (g sediment)-1. The sediment-sample collected from 275 cmbsf (centimeters beneath the seafloor) of the 530-mbsl-core yielded many such obligately aerobic isolates belonging to Cereibacter, Guyparkeria, Halomonas, Methylophaga, Pseudomonas and Sulfitobacter which died upon anaerobic incubation, despite being provided all possible electron acceptors and fermentative substrates. High percentages of metatranscriptomic reads from the 275 cmbsf sediment-sample, and metagenomic reads from all 25 sediment-samples, matched the isolates' genomic sequences including those for aerobic metabolisms, genetic/environmental information processing and cell division, thereby illustrating the bacteria's in-situ activity, and ubiquity across the sediment-horizons, respectively. The findings hold critical implications for organic carbon sequestration/remineralization, and inorganic compounds oxidation, within the sediment realm of global marine OMZs.

## Microbial prospection of communities that produce biosurfactants from the water column and sediments of the Gulf of Mexico.
 24.09.2020, _D Morales-Guzmán, F Martínez-Morales, B Bertrand, NS Rosas-Galván, N Curiel-Maciel, KV Teymennet-Ramírez, L Mazón-Román, AF Licea-Navarro, MR Trejo-Hernández_


Microbial communities capable of hydrocarbon degradation linked to biosurfactant (BS) and bioemulsifier (BE) production are basically unexplored in the Gulf of México (GOM). In this work, the BS and BE production of culturable marine bacterial hydrocarbonoclasts consortia isolated from two sites (the Perdido Fold Belt and Coatzacoalcos area) was investigated. The prospection at different locations and depths led to the screening and isolation of a wide variety of bacterial consortia with BS and BE activities, after culture enrichment with crude oil and glycerol as the carbon sources. At least 55 isolated consortia presented reduction in surface tension (ST) and emulsifying activity (EI24 ). After colony purification, bacteria were submitted to polyphasic analysis assays that resulted in the identification of different strains of cultivable Gammaproteobacteria Gram (-) Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Pseudomonas Vibrio, Shewanella, Thalassospira, Idiomarina, Pseudoalteromonas, Photobacterium, and Gram (+) Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Microbacterium. Overall, the best results for ST reduction and EI24 were obtained with consortia. Individually, Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Enterobacter strains showed the best results for the reduction of ST after 6 days, while Thalassospira and Idiomarina strains showed the best results for EI24 (above 68% after 9 days). Consortia isolates from the GOM had the ability to degrade crude oil by up to 40-80 % after 24 and 36 months, respectively. In all cases, biodegradation of crude oil was related to the reduction in ST and bioemulsifying activity, and was independent from the depth in the water column.

## Anatomy, immunology, digestive physiology and microbiota of the salmonid intestine: Knowns and unknowns under the impact of an expanding industrialized production.
 26.09.2020, _H Bjørgen, Y Li, TM Kortner, Å Krogdahl, EO Koppang_


Increased industrialized production of salmonids challenges aspects concerning available feed resources and animal welfare. The immune system plays a key component in this respect. Novel feed ingredients may trigger unwarranted immune responses again affecting the well-being of the fish. Here we review our current knowledge concerning salmon intestinal anatomy, immunity, digestive physiology and microbiota in the context of industrialized feeding regimes. We point out knowledge gaps and indicate promising novel technologies to improve salmonid intestinal health.

## Method development and validation for the quantification of organic acids in microbial samples using anionic exchange solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
 24.09.2020, _S Heyen, BM Scholz-Böttcher, R Rabus, H Wilkes_


Organic acids play a key role in central metabolic functions of organisms, are crucial for understanding regulatory processes and are ubiquitous inside the cell. Therefore, quantification of these compounds provides a valuable approach for studying dynamics of metabolic processes, in particular when the organism faces changing environmental conditions. However, the extraction and analysis of organic acids can be challenging and validated methods available in this field are limited. In this study, we developed a method for the extraction and quantification of organic acids from microbial samples based on solid-phase extraction on a strong anionic exchange cartridge and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis. Full method validation was conducted to determine quality parameters of the new method. Recoveries for 12 of the 15 aromatic and aliphatic acids were between 100 and 111% and detection limits between 3 and 272 ng/mL. The ranges for the regression coefficients and process standard deviations for these compound classes were 0.9874-0.9994 and 0.04-0.69 μg/mL, respectively. Limitations were encountered when targeting aliphatic acids with hydroxy, oxo or enol ester functions. Finally, we demonstrated the applicability of the method on cell extracts of the bacterium Escherichia coli and the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum. Graphical abstract.

## A novel universal primer pair for prokaryotes with improved performances for anammox containing communities.
 25.09.2020, _L Mazzoli, G Munz, T Lotti, M Ramazzotti_


Abundance profiling via 16S rRNA targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) is a common procedure to characterize mixtures of prokaryotic populations inhabiting an environment. Depending on the variable region/s addressed, different maps can be obtained due to their different information content. In this work, we focussed on wastewater microbial communities and we compared several recently developed universal primers that addressed regions V1-V3, V3-V4 and V4. They all proved to have good performance over a wide range of microbial phyla, but the phylum Planctomycetes was not optimally covered, especially for members of the Brocadiales family. Such bacteria are at the basis of the novel nitrogen removal strategy based on anammox process. To overcome this limitation we performed an extensive bioinformatic analysis that allowed the design of a primer (Pro341FB) that shows increased sensitivity for this specific phylum with respect to the previously proposed Pro341F primer. Upon validation using a 16S NGS survey on microbial communities from different wastewater treatment plant (activated sludge systems, anaerobic digesters, aerobic and anaerobic granules) we demonstrated that Pro341FB is able to reveal up to 5 times more members of the Candidatus Brocadiales family (plus many other previously under-covered prokaryotes) than Pro341F, without affecting its excellent previous coverage.
