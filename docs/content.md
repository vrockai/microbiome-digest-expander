## Emerging roles of intratumor microbiota in cancer: tumorigenesis and management strategies.
 11.09.2024, _Z Shi, Z Li, M Zhang_


The intricate interplay between the host and its microbiota has garnered increasing attention in the past decade. Specifically, the emerging recognition of microorganisms within diverse cancer tissues, previously presumed sterile, has ignited a resurgence of enthusiasm and research endeavors. Four potential migratory routes have been identified as the sources of intratumoral microbial "dark matter," including direct invasion of mucosal barriers, spreading from normal adjacent tissue, hematogenous spread, and lymphatic drainage, which contribute to the highly heterogeneous features of intratumor microbiota. Importantly, multitudes of studies delineated the roles of intratumor microbiota in cancer initiation and progression, elucidating underlying mechanisms such as genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, immune dysfunctions, activating oncogenic pathways, and inducing metastasis. With the deepening understanding of intratumoral microbial composition, novel microbiota-based strategies for early cancer diagnosis and prognostic stratification continue to emerge. Furthermore, intratumor microbiota exerts significant influence on the efficacy of cancer therapeutics, particularly immunotherapy, making it an enticing target for intervention in cancer treatment. In this review, we present a comprehensive discussion of the current understanding pertaining to the developmental history, heterogeneous profiles, underlying originations, and carcinogenic mechanisms of intratumor microbiota, and uncover its potential predictive and intervention values, as well as several inevitable challenges as a target for personalized cancer management strategies.

Fungal effector proteins function at the interfaces of diverse interactions between fungi and their plant and animal hosts, facilitating interactions that are pathogenic or mutualistic. Recent advancements in protein structure prediction have significantly accelerated the identification and functional predictions of these rapidly evolving effector proteins. This development enables scientists to generate testable hypotheses for functional validation using experimental approaches. Research frontiers in effector biology include understanding pathways through which effector proteins are secreted or translocated into host cells, their roles in manipulating host microbiomes, and their contribution to interacting with host immunity. Comparative effector repertoires among different fungal-host interactions can highlight unique adaptations, providing insights for the development of novel antifungal therapies and biocontrol strategies.

## Human milk variation is shaped by maternal genetics and impacts the infant gut microbiome.

Human milk is a complex mix of nutritional and bioactive components that provide complete nutrition for the infant. However, we lack a systematic knowledge of the factors shaping milk composition and how milk variation influences infant health. Here, we used multi-omic profiling to characterize interactions between maternal genetics, milk gene expression, milk composition, and the infant fecal microbiome in 242 exclusively breastfeeding mother-infant pairs. We identified 487 genetic loci associated with milk gene expression unique to the lactating mammary gland, including loci that impacted breast cancer risk and human milk oligosaccharide concentration. Integrative analyses uncovered connections between milk gene expression and infant gut microbiome, including an association between the expression of inflammation-related genes with IL-6 concentration in milk and the abundance of Bifidobacteria in the infant gut. Our results show how an improved understanding of the genetics and genomics of human milk connects lactation biology with maternal and infant health.

## Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics.
 09.09.2024, _MR Timm, SK Russell, SJ Hultgren_


Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

## Dietary-timing-induced gut microbiota diurnal oscillations modulate inflammatory rhythms in rheumatoid arthritis.
 11.09.2024, _F Ma, Z Li, H Liu, S Chen, S Zheng, J Zhu, H Shi, H Ye, Z Qiu, L Gao, B Han, Q Yang, X Wang, Y Zhang, L Cheng, H Fan, S Lv, X Zhao, H Zhou, J Li, M Hong_


Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition characterized by inflammatory activity with distinct rhythmic fluctuations. However, the precise mechanisms governing these inflammatory rhythms remain elusive. Here, we explore the interaction between dietary patterns, gut microbiota diurnal oscillations, and the rhythmicity of RA in both collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice and patients with RA and highlight the significance of dietary timing in modulating RA inflammatory rhythms linked to gut microbiota. Specifically, we discovered that Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis) uses β-glucosidase (β-GC) to release glycitein (GLY) from the diet in response to daily nutritional cues, influencing RA inflammatory rhythms dependent on the sirtuin 5-nuclear factor-κB (SIRT5-NF-κB) axis. Notably, we validated the daily fluctuations of P. distasonis-β-GC-GLY in patients with RA through continuous sampling across day-night cycles. These findings underscore the crucial role of dietary timing in RA rhythmicity and propose potential clinical implications for novel therapeutic strategies to alleviate arthritis.
