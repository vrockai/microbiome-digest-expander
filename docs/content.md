Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump.

Cognitive impairment is prevalent across neuropsychiatric disorders but there is a lack of treatment strategies with robust, enduring effects. Emerging evidence indicates that altitude-like hypoxia cognition training may induce long-lasting neuroplasticity and improve cognition. We will investigate whether repeated cognition training under normobaric hypoxia can improve cognitive functions in healthy individuals and patients with affective disorders and the neurobiological underpinnings of such effects.

At present, the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) is difficult, and there is an urgent need for better diagnostic methods. This study enrolled 136 patients from 2020 to 2021 and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens. We used metatranscriptome to analyze the lower respiratory tract microbiome (LRTM) and host immune response. The diversity of the LRTM in LRTIs significantly decreased, manifested by a decrease in the abundance of normal microbiota and an increase in the abundance of opportunistic pathogens. The upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the LRTIs group were mainly enriched in infection immune response-related pathways. Klebsiella pneumoniae had the most significant increase in abundance in LRTIs, which was strongly correlated with host infection or inflammation genes TNFRSF1B, CSF3R, and IL6R. We combined LRTM and host transcriptome data to construct a machine-learning model with 12 screened features to discriminate LRTIs and non-LRTIs. The results showed that the model trained by Random Forest in the validate set had the best performance (ROC AUC: 0.937, 95% CI: 0.832-1). The independent external dataset showed an accuracy of 76.5% for this model. This study suggests that the model integrating LRTM and host transcriptome data can be an effective tool for LRTIs diagnosis.

Weight loss improves metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). We investigated whether there were associated changes in intestinal permeability, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and gut microbiota, which are implicated in the pathophysiology of MASH. Sixteen adults with MASH, moderate fibrosis, and obesity received a low-energy total diet replacement program for 12 weeks and stepped food re-introduction over the following 12 weeks (ISRCTN12900952). Intestinal permeability, fecal SCFAs, and fecal microbiota were assessed at 0, 12, and 24 weeks. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression and sparse partial least-squares regression. Fourteen participants completed the trial, lost 15% (95% CI: 11.2-18.6%) of their weight, and 93% had clinically relevant reductions in liver disease severity markers. Serum zonulin concentrations were reduced at both 12 and 24 weeks (152.0 ng/ml, 95% CI: 88.0-217.4, p &lt; 0.001). Each percentage point of weight loss was associated with a 13.2 ng/mL (95% CI: 3.8-22.5, p &lt; 0.001) reduction in zonulin. For every 10 ng/mL reduction in zonulin, there was a 6.8% (95% CI: 3.5%-10.2, p &lt; 0.001) reduction in liver fat. There were reductions in SCFA and alpha diversity evenness as well as increases in beta diversity of the gut microbiota at 12 weeks, but the changes did not persist at 24 weeks. In conclusion, substantial dietary energy restriction is associated with significant improvement in MASH markers alongside reduction in intestinal permeability. Changes in gut microbiota and SCFA were not maintained with sustained reductions in weight and liver fat, suggesting that microbiome modulation may not explain the relationship between weight loss and improvements in MASH.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas. Despite of a steadily increasing in morbidity and mortality, there is still no effective therapy. Gut microbial dysbiosis and its derived-metabolites disorder have been shown to play an important role in the development of AP, however, little is known regarding the crosstalk between gut microbiota and metabolites. In this study, we assessed the alterations in gut microbiota and metabolites by constructing three AP mouse models by means of metagenomic and metabolomic sequencing, and further clarified their relationship by correlation analysis. The results revealed that each model exhibited unique flora and metabolite profiles. KEGG analysis showed that the differential flora and metabolite-enriched pathway functions were correlated with lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, two core differential bacterial species on Burkholderiales bacterium YL45 and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum along with eleven differential metabolites appeared to exert certain effects during the course of AP. In conclusion, further exploration of the crosstalk between microbiota and derived metabolites may provide novel insights and strategies into the diagnosis and treatment of AP.

_Humans, Oligosaccharides, Prebiotics, Adult, Male, Intestine, Small, Female, Young Adult, Kinetics, Middle Aged, Galactose_
Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) are food ingredients that improve human health, but their degradation throughout the human small intestine is not well understood. We studied the breakdown kinetics of FOS and GOS in the intestines of seven healthy Dutch adults. Subjects were equipped with a catheter in the distal ileum or proximal colon and consumed 5 g of chicory-derived FOS (degree of polymerization (DP) DP2-10), and 5 g of GOS (DP2-6). Postprandially, intestinal content was frequently collected until 350 min and analyzed for mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides. FOS and GOS had recoveries of 96 ± 25% and 76 ± 28%, respectively. FOS DP ≥ 2 and GOS DP ≥ 3 abundances in the distal small intestine or proximal colon matched the consumed doses, while GOS dimers (DP2) had lower recoveries, namely 22.8 ± 11.1% for β-D-gal-(1↔1)-α-D-glc+β-D-gal-(1↔1)-β-D-glc, 19.3 ± 19.1% for β-D-gal-(1 → 2)-D-glc+β-D-gal-(1 → 3)-D-glc, 43.7 ± 24.6% for β-D-gal-(1 → 6)-D-gal, and 68.0 ± 38.5% for β-D-gal-(1 → 4)-D-gal. Lactose was still present in the distal small intestine of all of the participants. To conclude, FOS DP ≥ 2 and GOS DP ≥ 3 were not degraded in the small intestine of healthy adults, while most prebiotic GOS DP2 was hydrolyzed in a structure-dependent manner. We provide evidence on the resistances of GOS with specific β-linkages in the human intestine, supporting the development of GOS prebiotics that resist small intestine digestion.

Dietary fibers can alter microbial metabolic output in support of healthy immune function; however, the impact of distinct fiber sources and immunomodulatory effects beyond short-chain fatty acid production are underexplored. In an effort to discern the effects of diverse fibers on host immunity, we employed five distinct rodent diets with varying fiber content and source in specific-pathogen-free, gnotobiotic (containing a 14-member synthetic human gut microbiota), and germ-free mice.

## Genomic surveillance as a scalable framework for precision phage therapy against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Phage therapy is gaining increasing interest in the fight against critically antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens. However, the narrow host range of bacteriophages hampers the development of broadly effective phage therapeutics and demands precision approaches. Here, we combine large-scale phylogeographic analysis with high-throughput phage typing to guide the development of precision phage cocktails targeting carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, a top-priority pathogen. Our analysis reveals that a few strain types dominate infections in each world region, with their geographical distribution remaining stable within 6 years. As we demonstrate in Eastern Europe, this spatiotemporal distribution enables preemptive preparation of region-specific phage collections that target most local infections. Finally, we showcase the efficacy of phage cocktails against prevalent strain types using in vitro and animal infection models. Ultimately, genomic surveillance identifies patients benefiting from the same phages across geographical scales, thus providing a scalable framework for precision phage therapy.

## Schlesinger Nailed It! Assessing a Key Primary Pharmacodynamic Property of Phages for Phage Therapy: Virion Encounter Rates with Motionless Bacterial Targets.
 24.05.2024, _ST Abedon_


Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses of bacteria and have been used as antibacterial agents now for over one-hundred years. The primary pharmacodynamics of therapeutic phages can be summed up as follows: phages at a certain concentration can reach bacteria at a certain rate, attach to bacteria that display appropriate receptors on their surfaces, infect, and (ideally) kill those now-adsorbed bacteria. Here, I consider the rate at which phages reach bacteria, during what can be dubbed as an 'extracellular search'. This search is driven by diffusion and can be described by what is known as the phage adsorption rate constant. That constant in turn is thought to be derivable from knowledge of bacterial size, virion diffusion rates, and the likelihood of phage adsorption given this diffusion-driven encounter with a bacterium. Here, I consider only the role of bacterial size in encounter rates. In 1932, Schlesinger hypothesized that bacterial size can be described as a function of cell radius (R, or R1), as based on the non-phage-based theorizing of Smoluchowski (1917). The surface area of a cell-what is actually encountered-varies however instead as a function R2. Here, I both provide and review evidence indicating that Schlesinger's assertion seems to have been correct.

Diet is a robust entrainment cue that regulates diurnal rhythms of the gut microbiome. We and others have shown that disruption of the circadian clock drives the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). While certain bacterial species have been suggested to play driver roles in CRC, it is unknown whether the intestinal clock impinges on the microbiome to accelerate CRC pathogenesis. To address this, genetic disruption of the circadian clock, in an Apc-driven mouse model of CRC, was used to define the impact on the gut microbiome. When clock disruption is combined with CRC, metagenomic sequencing identified dysregulation of many bacterial genera including Bacteroides, Helicobacter, and Megasphaera. We identify functional changes to microbial pathways including dysregulated nucleic acid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as disruption of intestinal barrier function. Our findings suggest that clock disruption impinges on microbiota composition and intestinal permeability that may contribute to CRC pathogenesis.

Seasonal rhythms are gaining attention given their impact on metabolic disorders development such as obesity gut microbiota is emerging as a key factor in mediating this link. However, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this regard, corticosterone may play a role as it has been shown to be affected by gut bacteria and seasonal rhythms, and has been linked to obesity. Thus, this study aimed to investigate if seasonal rhythms effects on corticosterone are influenced by gut microbiota in obese rats and whether this may be related to seasonal and clock genes expression in the pituitary gland and colon. Fischer 344 male rats fed with cafeteria diet (CAF) were housed under different photoperiods for 9 weeks and treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) in drinking water during the last 4 weeks. Rats fed with standard chow and CAF-fed rats without ABX were included as controls. ABX altered gut microbiota, corticosterone levels and seasonal clock expression in the pituitary depending on photoperiod conditions. These results suggest a link between gut bacteria, seasonal rhythms and corticosterone and a novel nutrigenomic target for obesity.

Soil nutrient status and soil-borne diseases are pivotal factors impacting modern intensive agricultural production. The interplay among plants, soil microbiome, and nutrient regimes in agroecosystems is essential for developing effective disease management. However, the influence of nutrient availability on soil-borne disease suppression and associated plant-microbe interactions remains to be fully explored. T his study aims to elucidate the mechanistic understanding of nutrient impacts on disease suppression, using phosphorous as a target nutrient.

Expanding and intensifying agriculture has led to a loss of soil carbon. As agroecosystems cover over 40% of Earth's land surface, they must be part of the solution put in action to mitigate climate change. Development of efficient management practices to maximize soil carbon retention is currently limited, in part, by a poor understanding of how plants, which input carbon to soil, and microbes, which determine its fate there, interact. Here we implement a diversity gradient by intercropping undersown species with barley in a large field trial, ranging from one to eight undersown species. We find that increasing plant diversity strengthens positive associations within the rhizosphere soil microbial community in relation to negative associations. These associations, in turn, enhance community carbon use efficiency. Jointly, our results highlight how increasing plant diversity in agriculture can be used as a management strategy to enhance carbon retention potential in agricultural soils.

## Making waves: From tap to gut- exploring the impact of drinking water on gut microbiota.
 28.09.2024, _HS Moghaddam, L Abkar, SJ Fowler_


Drinking water (DW) harbours diverse microbial species and chemical attributes. Water comprises the greatest portion of our daily diet, ingested both on its own and used in the preparation of food. DW is our major source of liquids, which is vital to maintaining homeostasis, and can also supply essential minerals. Limited evidence suggests that DW plays a role in shaping the gut microbiome, which implies that it may impact human health. Despite its significant contribution to diet, DW is often overlooked in studies examining dietary influences on the gut microbiota. This perspective explores our current understanding of the link between DW and the gut microbiota - an area of human microbiome science that has been surprisingly understudied. Existing studies reveal links between DW source, microbiota composition, and gut health, emphasizing the need for comprehensive investigations. Understanding the interplay between DW and gut microbiota holds potential for tailored interventions to enhance human health.

For taxonomy based classification of metagenomics assembled contigs, current methods use sequence similarity to identify their most likely taxonomy. However, in the related field of metagenomic binning, contigs are routinely clustered using information from both the contig sequences and their abundance. We introduce Taxometer, a neural network based method that improves the annotations and estimates the quality of any taxonomic classifier using contig abundance profiles and tetra-nucleotide frequencies. We apply Taxometer to five short-read CAMI2 datasets and find that it increases the average share of correct species-level contig annotations of the MMSeqs2 tool from 66.6% to 86.2%. Additionally, it reduce the share of wrong species-level annotations in the CAMI2 Rhizosphere dataset by an average of two-fold for Metabuli, Centrifuge, and Kraken2. Futhermore, we use Taxometer for benchmarking taxonomic classifiers on two complex long-read metagenomics data sets where ground truth is not known. Taxometer is available as open-source software and can enhance any taxonomic annotation of metagenomic contigs.

Cognitive impairment is prevalent across neuropsychiatric disorders but there is a lack of treatment strategies with robust, enduring effects. Emerging evidence indicates that altitude-like hypoxia cognition training may induce long-lasting neuroplasticity and improve cognition. We will investigate whether repeated cognition training under normobaric hypoxia can improve cognitive functions in healthy individuals and patients with affective disorders and the neurobiological underpinnings of such effects.

## Emergent ecological patterns and modelling of gut microbiomes in health and in disease.
 27.09.2024, _J Pasqualini, S Facchin, A Rinaldo, A Maritan, E Savarino, S Suweis_


Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the human microbiome. Despite this progress, challenges persist in comprehending the microbiome's influence on disease, hindered by technical complexities in species classification, abundance estimation, and data compositionality. At the same time, the existence of macroecological laws describing the variation and diversity in microbial communities irrespective of their environment has been recently proposed using 16s data and explained by a simple phenomenological model of population dynamics. We here investigate the relationship between dysbiosis, i.e. in unhealthy individuals there are deviations from the "regular" composition of the gut microbial community, and the existence of macro-ecological emergent law in microbial communities. We first quantitatively reconstruct these patterns at the species level using shotgun data, and addressing the consequences of sampling effects and statistical errors on ecological patterns. We then ask if such patterns can discriminate between healthy and unhealthy cohorts. Concomitantly, we evaluate the efficacy of different statistical generative models, which incorporate sampling and population dynamics, to describe such patterns and distinguish which are expected by chance, versus those that are potentially informative about disease states or other biological drivers. A critical aspect of our analysis is understanding the relationship between model parameters, which have clear ecological interpretations, and the state of the gut microbiome, thereby enabling the generation of synthetic compositional data that distinctively represent healthy and unhealthy individuals. Our approach, grounded in theoretical ecology and statistical physics, allows for a robust comparison of these models with empirical data, enhancing our understanding of the strengths and limitations of simple microbial models of population dynamics.

## Comparative evaluation of soil DNA extraction kits for long read metagenomic sequencing.
 01.10.2024, _HT Child, L Wierzbicki, GR Joslin, RK Tennant_


Metagenomics has been transformative in our understanding of the diversity and function of soil microbial communities. Applying long read sequencing to whole genome shotgun metagenomics has the potential to revolutionise soil microbial ecology through improved taxonomic classification, functional characterisation and metagenome assembly. However, optimisation of robust methods for long read metagenomics of environmental samples remains undeveloped. In this study, Oxford Nanopore sequencing using samples from five commercially available soil DNA extraction kits was compared across four soil types, in order to optimise read length and reproducibility for comparative long read soil metagenomics. Average extracted DNA lengths varied considerably between kits, but longer DNA fragments did not translate consistently into read lengths. Highly variable decreases in the length of resulting reads from some kits were associated with poor classification rate and low reproducibility in microbial communities identified between technical repeats. Replicate samples from other kits showed more consistent conversion of extracted DNA fragment size into read length and resulted in more congruous microbial community representation. Furthermore, extraction kits showed significant differences in the community representation and structure they identified across all soil types. Overall, the QIAGEN DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit displayed the best suitability for reproducible long-read WGS metagenomic sequencing, although further optimisation of DNA purification and library preparation may enable translation of higher molecular weight DNA from other kits into longer read lengths. These findings provide a novel insight into the importance of optimising DNA extraction for achieving replicable results from long read metagenomic sequencing of environmental samples.

Skin aging is influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors that progressively impair skin functionality over time. Investigating the skin aging process requires thorough research using innovative technologies. This review explores the use of in vitro human 3D culture models, serving as valuable alternatives to animal ones, in skin aging research. The aim is to highlight the benefits and necessity of improving the methodology in analyzing the molecular mechanisms underlying human skin aging. Traditional 2D models, including monolayers of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, or melanocytes, even if providing cost-effective and straightforward methods to study critical processes such as extracellular matrix degradation, pigmentation, and the effects of secretome on skin cells, fail to replicate the complex tissue architecture with its intricated interactions. Advanced 3D models (organoid cultures, "skin-on-chip" technologies, reconstructed human skin, and 3D bioprinting) considerably enhance the physiological relevance, enabling a more accurate representation of skin aging and its peculiar features. By reporting the advantages and limitations of 3D models, this review highlights the importance of using advanced in vitro systems to develop practical anti-aging preventive and reparative approaches and improve human translational research in this field. Further exploration of these technologies will provide new opportunities for previously unexplored knowledge on skin aging.
