## STROBE-metagenomics: a STROBE extension statement to guide the reporting of metagenomics studies.
 12.08.2020, _T Bharucha, C Oeser, F Balloux, JR Brown, EC Carbo, A Charlett, CY Chiu, ECJ Claas, MC de Goffau, JJC de Vries, M Eloit, S Hopkins, JF Huggett, D MacCannell, S Morfopoulou, A Nath, DM O'Sullivan, LB Reoma, LP Shaw, I Sidorov, PJ Simner, L Van Tan, EC Thomson, L van Dorp, MR Wilson, J Breuer, N Field_


The term metagenomics refers to the use of sequencing methods to simultaneously identify genomic material from all organisms present in a sample, with the advantage of greater taxonomic resolution than culture or other methods. Applications include pathogen detection and discovery, species characterisation, antimicrobial resistance detection, virulence profiling, and study of the microbiome and microecological factors affecting health. However, metagenomics involves complex and multistep processes and there are important technical and methodological challenges that require careful consideration to support valid inference. We co-ordinated a multidisciplinary, international expert group to establish reporting guidelines that address specimen processing, nucleic acid extraction, sequencing platforms, bioinformatics considerations, quality assurance, limits of detection, power and sample size, confirmatory testing, causality criteria, cost, and ethical issues. The guidance recognises that metagenomics research requires pragmatism and caution in interpretation, and that this field is rapidly evolving.

## Schizasterid Heart Urchins Host Microorganisms in a Digestive Symbiosis of Mesozoic Origin.
 14.08.2020, _A Ziegler, AM Gilligan, JG Dillon, B Pernet_


Because of their lifestyles, abundance, and feeding habits, infaunal marine deposit feeders have a significant impact on the ocean floor. As these animals also ingest microorganisms associated with their sediment and seawater diet, their digestive tract usually contains a diverse array of bacteria. However, while most of these microorganisms are transients, some may become part of a resident gut microbiome, in particular when sheltered from the main flow of digesta in specialized gut compartments. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of the structure and contents of the intestinal caecum (IC), a hindgut diverticulum found exclusively in schizasterid heart urchins (Echinoidea: Spatangoida: Schizasteridae). Based on specimens of Brisaster townsendi, in addition to various other schizasterid taxa, our structural characterization of the IC shows that the organ is a highly specialized gut compartment with unique structural properties. Next generation sequencing shows that the IC contains a microbial population composed predominantly of Bacteroidales, Desulfobacterales, and Spirochaetales. The microbiome of this gut compartment is significantly different in composition and lower in diversity than the microbial population in the sediment-filled main digestive tract. Inferences on the function and evolution of the IC and its microbiome suggest that this symbiosis plays a distinct role in host nutrition and that it evolved at least 66 million years ago during the final phase of the Mesozoic.

## Microbiota-host interactions shape ageing dynamics.
 10.08.2020, _M Popkes, DR Valenzano_


Occupying the interface between host and environment, host-associated microbes play fundamental roles in nutrient absorption, essential metabolite synthesis, development of the immune system, defence against pathogens and pathogenesis. Microbiota composition and function is rather stable during adulthood, while it dramatically changes during early development, frailty and disease. Ageing is associated with progressive decrease of homeostasis, often resulting in disruption of the physiological balance between host and commensal microbes, ultimately leading to dysbiosis and host demise. Generally, high microbial diversity is associated with health and a youthful state, while low individual microbial diversity and larger inter-individual microbial diversity is associated with ageing and disease states. Different species are equipped with species-specific commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microbial communities. How and whether the specific host-microbiota consortia co-evolved with host physiology to ensure homeostasis and promote individual fitness remains an open question. In this essay, we propose that the evolution of vertebrate-specific immune adaptations may have enabled the establishment of highly diverse, species-specific commensal microbial communities. We discuss how the maintenance of intact immune surveillance mechanisms, which allow discrimination between commensal and pathogenic bacteria, fail during ageing and lead to the onset of known ageing-related diseases. We discuss how host-microbiota interactions are key to maintaining homeostasis despite external perturbations, but also how they affect a range of host-specific ageing-related phenotypes. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of the microbiome in host evolution'.

## Pathogen resistance may be the principal evolutionary advantage provided by the microbiome.
 10.08.2020, _MR McLaren, BJ Callahan_


To survive, plants and animals must continually defend against pathogenic microbes that would invade and disrupt their tissues. Yet they do not attempt to extirpate all microbes. Instead, they tolerate and even encourage the growth of commensal microbes, which compete with pathogens for resources and via direct inhibition. We argue that hosts have evolved to cooperate with commensals in order to enhance the pathogen resistance this competition provides. We briefly describe competition between commensals and pathogens within the host, consider how natural selection might favour hosts that tilt this competition in favour of commensals, and describe examples of extant host traits that may serve this purpose. Finally, we consider ways that this cooperative immunity may have facilitated the adaptive evolution of non-pathogen-related host traits. On the basis of these observations, we argue that pathogen resistance vies with other commensal-provided benefits for being the principal evolutionary advantage provided by the microbiome to host lineages across the tree of life. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of the microbiome in host evolution'.

## A Randomized Clinical Trial of Fecal Microbiota Transplant for Alcohol Use Disorder.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with microbial alterations that worsen with cirrhosis. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) could be a promising approach.
