## Toward an integrative framework for microbial community coalescence.
 07.03.2024, _GF Custer, L Bresciani, F Dini-Andreote_


Community coalescence is defined as the mixing of intact ecological communities. From river confluences to fecal microbiota transplantation, community coalescence constitutes a common ecological occurrence affecting natural and engineered microbial systems. In this opinion article, we propose an integrative framework for microbial community coalescence to guide advances in our understanding of this important - yet underexplored - ecological phenomenon. We start by aligning community coalescence with the unified framework of biological invasion and enumerate commonalities and idiosyncrasies between these two analogous processes. Then, we discuss how organismal interactions and cohesive establishment affect coalescence outcomes with direct implications for community functioning. Last, we propose the use of ecological null modeling to study the interplay of ecological processes structuring community reassembly following coalescence.

## Studying mixed-species biofilms of Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus using evolutionary game theory.
 06.03.2024, _S Dühring, S Schuster_


Mixed-species biofilms of Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus pose a significant clinical challenge due to their resistance to the human immune system and antimicrobial therapy. Using evolutionary game theory and nonlinear dynamics, we analyse the complex interactions between these organisms to understand their coexistence in the human host. We determine the Nash equilibria and evolutionary stable strategies of the game between C. albicans and S. aureus and point out different states of the mixed-species biofilm. Using replicator equations we study the fungal-bacterial interactions on a population level. Our focus is on the influence of available nutrients and the quorum sensing molecule farnesol, including the potential therapeutic use of artificially added farnesol. We also investigate the impact of the suggested scavenging of C. albicans hyphae by S. aureus. Contrary to common assumptions, we confirm the hypothesis that under certain conditions, mixed-species biofilms are not universally beneficial. Instead, different Nash equilibria occur depending on encountered conditions (i.e. varying farnesol levels, either produced by C. albicans or artificially added), including antagonism. We further show that the suggested scavenging of C. albicans' hyphae by S. aureus does not influence the overall outcome of the game. Moreover, artificially added farnesol strongly affects the dynamics of the game, although its use as a medical adjuvant (add-on medication) may pose challenges.

## Microbial Communities and Functional Genes in Periodontitis and Healthy Controls.
 06.03.2024, _Z Ma, Z Jiang, H Dong, W Xu, S Yan, J Chen, A Li, X Wang_


Periodontitis is a chronic progressive disease and the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Recent studies have shown the impact of oral microbial communities on systemic health and diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease. In previous case control studies investigatin the relationship between periodontal disease and the oral microbiota, little attention has been paid to the intersections of these domains.

## Unlocking the secrets: exploring the influence of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and microbiome on cancer development.
 06.03.2024, _M Rayan, TS Sayed, OJ Hussein, L Therachiyil, ZH Maayah, C Maccalli, S Uddin, JHM Prehn, HM Korashy_


Gut microbiota regulates various aspects of human physiology by producing metabolites, metabolizing enzymes, and toxins. Many studies have linked microbiota with human health and altered microbiome configurations with the occurrence of several diseases, including cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that the microbiome can influence the initiation and progression of several cancers. Moreover, some microbiotas of the gut and oral cavity have been reported to infect tumors, initiate metastasis, and promote the spread of cancer to distant organs, thereby influencing the clinical outcome of cancer patients. The gut microbiome has recently been reported to interact with environmental factors such as diet and exposure to environmental toxicants. Exposure to environmental pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) induces a shift in the gut microbiome metabolic pathways, favoring a proinflammatory microenvironment. In addition, other studies have also correlated cancer incidence with exposure to PAHs. PAHs are known to induce organ carcinogenesis through activating a ligand-activated transcriptional factor termed the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which metabolizes PAHs to highly reactive carcinogenic intermediates. However, the crosstalk between AhR and the microbiome in mediating carcinogenesis is poorly reviewed. This review aims to discuss the role of exposure to environmental pollutants and activation of AhR on microbiome-associated cancer progression and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in cancer development.

## Short term supplementation with cranberry extract modulates gut microbiota in human and displays a bifidogenic effect.
 06.03.2024, _J Lessard-Lord, C Roussel, J Lupien-Meilleur, P Généreux, V Richard, V Guay, D Roy, Y Desjardins_


Cranberry is associated with multiple health benefits, which are mostly attributed to its high content of (poly)phenols, particularly flavan-3-ols. However, clinical trials attempting to demonstrate these positive effects have yielded heterogeneous results, partly due to the high inter-individual variability associated with gut microbiota interaction with these molecules. In fact, several studies have demonstrated the ability of these molecules to modulate the gut microbiota in animal and in vitro models, but there is a scarcity of information in human subjects. In addition, it has been recently reported that cranberry also contains high concentrations of oligosaccharides, which could contribute to its bioactivity. Hence, the aim of this study was to fully characterize the (poly)phenolic and oligosaccharidic contents of a commercially available cranberry extract and evaluate its capacity to positively modulate the gut microbiota of 28 human subjects. After only four days, the (poly)phenols and oligosaccharides-rich cranberry extract, induced a strong bifidogenic effect, along with an increase in the abundance of several butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Clostridium and Anaerobutyricum. Plasmatic and fecal short-chain fatty acids profiles were also altered by the cranberry extract with a decrease in acetate ratio and an increase in butyrate ratio. Finally, to characterize the inter-individual variability, we stratified the participants according to the alterations observed in the fecal microbiota following supplementation. Interestingly, individuals having a microbiota characterized by the presence of Prevotella benefited from an increase in Faecalibacterium with the cranberry extract supplementation.

## Fecal microbiota impacts development of Cryptosporidium parvum in the mouse.
 06.03.2024, _G Widmer, HN Creasey_


The dependence of Cryptosporidium parasites on host cell metabolites suggests that the development of nutritional interventions to limit parasite proliferation should be feasible. Based on this concept, we are testing dietary interventions to affect the enterocytes' metabolism in a manner that limits intracellular multiplication of the parasite. We hypothesize that changes in the metabolic pathways encoded by the gastro-intestinal tract microbiota may restrict parasite proliferation. To identify taxonomic and metabolic features of the microbiota associated with severity of cryptosporidiosis, as determined by estimating oocyst output, we characterized the fecal microbiota from mice experimentally infected with Cryptosporidium parvum. To eliminate the confounding effect of the interaction between co-housed mice, as well as facilitate the identification of microbiota markers associated with severity of cryptosporidiosis, fecal microbiota from individually caged mice were analyzed. Variation partitioning analysis applied to 16S sequence data from 25 mice belonging to four experiments shows that experiment was by far the biggest source of microbiota variation. Severity of cryptosporidiosis explained a smaller, though significant, fraction of microbiota variation. Notably, this effect was significant in the pre-patent phase of the infection, before mice excreted oocysts. These results are consistent with the pre-patent intestinal microbiota having a modest, but measurable, effect on cryptosporidiosis.

## High fat diet is associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis and decreased gut microbial derived metabolites related to metabolic health in young Göttingen Minipigs.

_Swine, Animals, Male, Female, Humans, Mice, Swine, Miniature, Diet, High-Fat, Metabolic Syndrome, Insulin Resistance, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Dysbiosis, Cholesterol, Mice, Inbred C57BL_
The objectives were 1) to characterize a Göttingen Minipig model of metabolic syndrome regarding its colon microbiota and circulating microbial products, and 2) to assess whether ovariectomized female and castrated male minipigs show similar phenotypes. Twenty-four nine-week-old Göttingen Minipigs were allocated to four groups based on sex and diet: ovariectomized females and castrated males fed either chow or high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. At study end, body composition and plasma biomarkers were measured, and a mixed meal tolerance test (MMT) and an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) were performed. The HFD groups had significantly higher weight gain, fat percentage, fasting plasma insulin and glucagon compared to the chow groups. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) was increased and glucose effectiveness derived from the IVGTT and Matsuda´s insulin sensitivity index from the MMT were decreased in the HFD groups. The HFD groups displayed dyslipidemia, with significantly increased total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, and decreased HDL/non-HDL cholesterol ratio. The colon microbiota of HFD minipigs clearly differed from the lean controls (GuniFrac distance matrix). The main bacteria families driving this separation were Clostridiaceae, Fibrobacteraceae, Flavobacteriaceae and Porphyromonadaceae. Moreover, the species richness was significantly decreased by HFD. In addition, HFD decreased the circulating level of short chain fatty acids and beneficial microbial metabolites hippuric acid, xanthine and trigonelline, while increasing the level of branched chain amino acids. Six and nine metabolically relevant genes were differentially expressed between chow-fed and HFD-fed animals in liver and omental adipose tissue, respectively. The HFD-fed pigs presented with metabolic syndrome, gut microbial dysbiosis and a marked decrease in healthy gut microbial products and thus displayed marked parallels to human obesity and insulin resistance. HFD-fed Göttingen Minipig therefore represents a relevant animal model for studying host-microbiota interactions. No significant differences between the castrated and ovariectomized minipigs were observed.

## Gustatory Responsiveness of Honey Bees Colonized with a Defined or Conventional Gut Microbiota.
 06.03.2024, _S Suenami, M Sato, R Miyazaki_


Gut microbes have many beneficial functions for host animals, such as food digestion and development of the immune system. An increasing number of studies report that gut bacteria also affect host neural function and behavior. The sucrose responsiveness of the western honey bee Apis mellifera, which harbors a characteristic gut microbiota, was recently reported to be increased by the presence of gut microbes. However, this responsiveness may vary depending on the experimental design, as animal behavior may be modulated by physiological states and environmental conditions. To evaluate the robustness of the effects of the gut microbiota on host gustatory responsiveness, we herein examined the sucrose responsiveness of honey bees colonized with a defined bacterial community or a conventional gut microbiota extracted from a field-collected bee. Although colonization was experimentally verified, sucrose responsiveness did not significantly differ among treatments after the 2- or 5-h starvation period. We concluded that the sucrose responsiveness of A. mellifera is not always affected by its gut microbiota. Therefore, host physiological conditions and environmental factors need to be considered when evaluating the impact of the gut microbiota on host neural function and behavior.

## Fungal infection of insects: molecular insights and prospects.
 07.03.2024, _S Hong, J Shang, Y Sun, G Tang, C Wang_


Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) distribute in different fungal phyla with variable host ranges and play essential role in regulating insect populations by infecting hosts via cuticle penetration. The representative ascomycete EPF of Metarhizium and Beauveria species have been widely used in mechanistic investigations of fungus-insect interactions and as ecofriendly mycoinsecticides. Here, we review the function of diverse genes, pathways, and secondary metabolites associated with EPF stepwise infections. In particular, emerging evidence has shown that EPF have to outcompete insect ectomicrobiotas prior to penetrating cuticles, and subvert or evade host antifungal immunity by using effector-like proteins and chemicals like plant pathogens. Future prospects are discussed for a better understanding of fungal pathobiology, which will provide novel insights into microbe-animal interactions.

Environmental variations have been observed to influence bacterial community composition, thereby impacting biological activities in the soil. Together, the information on bacterial functional groups in Phatthalung sago palm-growing soils remains limited. In this work, the core soil bacterial community in the Phatthalung sago palm-growing areas during both the summer and rainy seasons was examined using V3-V4 amplicon sequencing. Our findings demonstrated that the seasons had no significant effects on the alpha diversity, but the beta diversity of the community was influenced by seasonal variations. The bacteria in the phyla Acidobacteriota, Actinobacteriota, Chloroflexi, Methylomirabilota, Planctomycetota, and Proteobacteria were predominantly identified across the soil samples. Among these, 26 genera were classified as a core microbiome, mostly belonging to uncultured bacteria. Gene functions related to photorespiration and methanogenesis were enriched in both seasons. Genes related to aerobic chemoheterotrophy metabolisms and nitrogen fixation were more abundant in the rainy season soils, while, human pathogen pneumonia-related genes were overrepresented in the summer season. The investigation not only provides into the bacterial composition inherent to the sago palm-cultivated soil but also the gene functions during the shift in seasons.

## Assigning the unassigned: A signature-based classification of rDNA metabarcodes reveals new deep-sea diversity.
 04.03.2024, _I Barrenechea Angeles, NL Nguyen, M Greco, KS Tan, J Pawlowski_

Environmental DNA metabarcoding reveals a vast genetic diversity of marine eukaryotes. Yet, most of the metabarcoding data remain unassigned due to the paucity of reference databases. This is particularly true for the deep-sea meiofauna and eukaryotic microbiota, whose hidden diversity is largely unexplored. Here, we tackle this issue by using unique DNA signatures to classify unknown metabarcodes assigned to deep-sea foraminifera. We analyzed metabarcoding data obtained from 311 deep-sea sediment samples collected in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone, an area of potential polymetallic nodule exploitation in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Using the signatures designed in the 37F hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene, we were able to classify 802 unassigned metabarcodes into 61 novel lineages, which have been placed in 27 phylogenetic clades. The comparison of new lineages with other foraminiferal datasets shows that most novel lineages are widely distributed in the deep sea. Five lineages are also present in the shallow-water datasets; however, phylogenetic analysis of these lineages separates deep-sea and shallow-water metabarcodes except in one case. While the signature-based classification does not solve the problem of gaps in reference databases, this taxonomy-free approach provides insight into the distribution and ecology of deep-sea species represented by unassigned metabarcodes, which could be useful in future applications of metabarcoding for environmental monitoring.
