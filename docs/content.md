## Role of the Microbiome in Regulating Bone Metabolism and Susceptibility to Osteoporosis.

The human microbiota functions at the interface between diet, medication-use, lifestyle, host immune development and health. It is therefore closely aligned with many of the recognised modifiable factors that influence bone mass accrual in the young, and bone maintenance and skeletal decline in older populations. While understanding of the relationship between micro-organisms and bone health is still in its infancy, two decades of broader microbiome research and discovery supports a role of the human gut microbiome in the regulation of bone metabolism and pathogenesis of osteoporosis as well as its prevention and treatment. Pre-clinical research has demonstrated biological interactions between the microbiome and bone metabolism. Furthermore, observational studies and randomized clinical trials have indicated that therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota by oral administration of probiotics may influence bone turnover and prevent bone loss in humans. In this paper, we summarize the content, discussion and conclusions of a workshop held by the Osteoporosis and Bone Research Academy of the Royal Osteoporosis Society in October, 2020. We provide a detailed review of the literature examining the relationship between the microbiota and bone health in animal models and in humans, as well as formulating the agenda for key research priorities required to advance this field. We also underscore the potential pitfalls in this research field that should be avoided and provide methodological recommendations to facilitate bridging the gap from promising concept to a potential cause and intervention target for osteoporosis.

## Defining and quantifying the core microbiome: Challenges and prospects.
 06.12.2021, _AT Neu, EE Allen, K Roy_


The term "core microbiome" has become widely used in microbial ecology over the last decade. Broadly, the core microbiome refers to any set of microbial taxa, or the genomic and functional attributes associated with those taxa, that are characteristic of a host or environment of interest. Most commonly, core microbiomes are measured as the microbial taxa shared among two or more samples from a particular host or environment. Despite the popularity of this term and its growing use, there is little consensus about how a core microbiome should be quantified in practice. Here, we present a brief history of the core microbiome concept and use a representative sample of the literature to review the different metrics commonly used for quantifying the core. Empirical analyses have used a wide range of metrics for quantifying the core microbiome, including arbitrary occurrence and abundance cutoff values, with the focal taxonomic level of the core ranging from phyla to amplicon sequence variants. However, many of these metrics are susceptible to sampling and other biases. Developing a standardized set of metrics for quantifying the core that accounts for such biases is necessary for testing specific hypotheses about the functional and ecological roles of core microbiomes.

## Clean room microbiome complexity impacts planetary protection bioburden.
 07.12.2021, _R Hendrickson, C Urbaniak, JJ Minich, HS Aronson, C Martino, R Stepanauskas, R Knight, K Venkateswaran_


The Spacecraft Assembly Facility (SAF) at the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the primary cleanroom facility used in the construction of some of the planetary protection (PP)-sensitive missions developed by NASA, including the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover that launched in July 2020. SAF floor samples (n=98) were collected, over a 6-month period in 2016 prior to the construction of the Mars rover subsystems, to better understand the temporal and spatial distribution of bacterial populations (total, viable, cultivable, and spore) in this unique cleanroom.
