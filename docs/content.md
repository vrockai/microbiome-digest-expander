Cyanobacteria from the genus Microcystis can form large mucilaginous colonies with attached heterotrophic bacteria-their microbiome. However, the nature of the relationship between Microcystis and its microbiome remains unclear. Is it a long-term, evolutionarily stable association? Which partners benefit? Here we report the genomic diversity of 109 individual Microcystis colonies-including cyanobacteria and associated bacterial genomes-isolated in situ and without culture from Lake Champlain, Canada and Pampulha Reservoir, Brazil.

The molecular bases for the symbiosis of the amphibian skin microbiome with its host are poorly understood. Here, we used the odor-producer Pseudomonas sp. MPFS and the treefrog Boana prasina as a model to explore bacterial genome determinants and the resulting mechanisms facilitating symbiosis. Pseudomonas sp. MPFS and its closest relatives, within a new clade of the P. fluoresens Group, have large genomes and were isolated from fishes and plants, suggesting environmental plasticity. We annotated 16 biosynthetic gene clusters from the complete genome sequence of this strain, including those encoding the synthesis of compounds with known antifungal activity and of odorous methoxypyrazines that likely mediate sexual interactions in Boana prasina. Comparative genomics of Pseudomonas also revealed that Pseudomonas sp. MPFS and its closest relatives have acquired specific resistance mechanisms against host antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), specifically two extra copies of a multidrug efflux pump and the same two-component regulatory systems known to trigger adaptive resistance to AMPs in P. aeruginosa. Subsequent molecular modeling indicated that these regulatory systems interact with an AMP identified in Boana prasina through the highly acidic surfaces of the proteins comprising their sensory domains. In agreement with a symbiotic relationship and a highly selective antibacterial function, this AMP did not inhibit the growth of Pseudomonas sp. MPFS but inhibited the growth of another Pseudomonas species and Escherichia coli in laboratory tests. This study provides deeper insights into the molecular interaction of the bacteria-amphibian symbiosis and highlights the role of specific adaptive resistance toward AMPs of the hosts.

## Gut microbiota involved in leptospiral infections.
 30.09.2021, _X Xie, J Liu, X Chen, S Zhang, R Tang, X Wu, W Zhang, Y Cao_


Leptospirosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease worldwide. Intestinal bleeding is a common but neglected symptom in severe leptospirosis. The regulatory mechanism of the gut microbiota on leptospirosis is still unclear. In this study, we found that Leptospira interrogans infection changed the composition of the gut microbiota in mice. Weight loss and an increased leptospiral load in organs were observed in the gut microbiota-depleted mice compared with those in the control mice. Moreover, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to the microbiota-depleted mice reversed these effects. The phagocytosis response and inflammatory response in bone marrow-derived macrophages and thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages were diminished in the microbiota-depleted mice after infection. However, the phagocytosis response and inflammatory response in resident peritoneal macrophage were not affected in the microbiota-depleted mice after infection. The diminished macrophage disappearance reaction (bacterial entry into the peritoneum acutely induced macrophage adherence to form local clots and out of the fluid phase) led to an increased leptospiral load in the peritoneal cavity in the microbiota-depleted mice. In addition, the impaired capacity of macrophages to clear leptospires increased leptospiral dissemination in Leptospira-infected microbiota-depleted mice. Our study identified the microbiota as an endogenous defense against L. interrogans infection. Modulating the structure and function of the gut microbiota may provide new individualized preventative strategies for the control of leptospirosis and related spirochetal infections.

Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) from lean donors to patients with obesity has been associated with metabolic benefits, yet results so far have been inconsistent. In this study, we tested the application of daily fiber supplementation as an adjunct to FMT therapy to modulate cardiometabolic outcomes. We performed a double-blind randomized trial in patients with severe obesity and metabolic syndrome receiving oral FMT, to test high-fermentable (HF) and low-fermentable (LF) fiber supplements (NCT03477916). Seventy participants were randomized to the FMT-HF (n = 17), FMT-LF (n = 17), HF (n = 17) and LF (n = 19) groups. The primary outcome was the assessment of change in insulin sensitivity from baseline to 6 weeks using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA2-IR/IS). After 6 weeks, only patients in the FMT-LF group had significant improvements in HOMA2-IR (3.16 ± 3.01 at 6 weeks versus 3.77 ± 3.57 at baseline; P = 0.02). No difference in HOMA2-IR was observed over this period for those in the FMT-HF group (3.25 ± 1.70 at 6 weeks versus 3.17 ± 1.72 at baseline; P = 0.8), the HF group (3.49 ± 1.43 at 6 weeks versus 3.26 ± 1.33 at baseline; P = 0.8) or the LF group (3.76 ± 2.01 at 6 weeks versus 3.56 ± 1.81 at baseline; P = 0.8). Interventions were safe and well-tolerated with no treatment-attributed serious adverse events. We provide proof of concept for the use of a single-dose oral FMT combined with daily low-fermentable fiber supplementation to improve insulin sensitivity in patients with severe obesity and metabolic syndrome.

## Gut bacteria identified in colorectal cancer patients promote tumourigenesis via butyrate secretion.

Emerging evidence is revealing that alterations in gut microbiota are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, very little is currently known about whether and how gut microbiota alterations are causally associated with CRC development. Here we show that 12 faecal bacterial taxa are enriched in CRC patients in two independent cohort studies. Among them, 2 Porphyromonas species are capable of inducing cellular senescence, an oncogenic stress response, through the secretion of the bacterial metabolite, butyrate. Notably, the invasion of these bacteria is observed in the CRC tissues, coinciding with the elevation of butyrate levels and signs of senescence-associated inflammatory phenotypes. Moreover, although the administration of these bacteria into ApcΔ14/+ mice accelerate the onset of colorectal tumours, this is not the case when bacterial butyrate-synthesis genes are disrupted. These results suggest a causal relationship between Porphyromonas species overgrowth and colorectal tumourigenesis which may be due to butyrate-induced senescence.
