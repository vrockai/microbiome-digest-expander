## Immunological characteristics govern the transition of COVID-19 to endemicity.
 16.02.2021, _JS Lavine, ON Bjornstad, R Antia_


We are currently faced with the question of how the severity of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may change in the years ahead. Our analysis of immunological and epidemiological data on endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) shows that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly but that disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. Our model, incorporating these components of immunity, recapitulates both the current severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the benign nature of HCoVs, suggesting that once the endemic phase is reached and primary exposure is in childhood, SARS-CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. We predict a different outcome for an emergent coronavirus that causes severe disease in children. These results reinforce the importance of behavioral containment during pandemic vaccine rollout, while prompting us to evaluate scenarios for continuing vaccination in the endemic phase.

## Can we modulate the breastfed infant gut microbiota through maternal diet?

Initial colonisation of the infant gut is robustly influenced by regular ingestion of human milk, a substance that contains microbes, microbial metabolites, immune proteins, and oligosaccharides. Numerous factors have been identified as potential determinants of the human milk and infant gut microbiota, including maternal diet; however, there is limited data on the influence of maternal diet during lactation on either of these. Here, we review the processes thought to contribute to human milk and infant gut bacterial colonisation and provide a basis for considering the role of maternal dietary patterns during lactation in shaping infant gut microbial composition and function. Although only one observational study has directly investigated the influence of maternal diet during lactation on the infant gut microbiome, data from animal studies suggests that modulation of the maternal gut microbiota, via diet or probiotics, may influence the mammary or milk microbiota. Additionally, evidence from human studies suggests that the maternal diet during pregnancy may affect the gut microbiota of the breastfed infant. Together, there is a plausible hypothesis that maternal diet during lactation may influence the infant gut microbiota. If substantiated in further studies, this may present a potential window of opportunity for modulating the infant gut microbiome in early life.
