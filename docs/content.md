The intricate interplay between the host and its microbiota has garnered increasing attention in the past decade. Specifically, the emerging recognition of microorganisms within diverse cancer tissues, previously presumed sterile, has ignited a resurgence of enthusiasm and research endeavors. Four potential migratory routes have been identified as the sources of intratumoral microbial "dark matter," including direct invasion of mucosal barriers, spreading from normal adjacent tissue, hematogenous spread, and lymphatic drainage, which contribute to the highly heterogeneous features of intratumor microbiota. Importantly, multitudes of studies delineated the roles of intratumor microbiota in cancer initiation and progression, elucidating underlying mechanisms such as genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, immune dysfunctions, activating oncogenic pathways, and inducing metastasis. With the deepening understanding of intratumoral microbial composition, novel microbiota-based strategies for early cancer diagnosis and prognostic stratification continue to emerge. Furthermore, intratumor microbiota exerts significant influence on the efficacy of cancer therapeutics, particularly immunotherapy, making it an enticing target for intervention in cancer treatment. In this review, we present a comprehensive discussion of the current understanding pertaining to the developmental history, heterogeneous profiles, underlying originations, and carcinogenic mechanisms of intratumor microbiota, and uncover its potential predictive and intervention values, as well as several inevitable challenges as a target for personalized cancer management strategies.

Fungal effector proteins function at the interfaces of diverse interactions between fungi and their plant and animal hosts, facilitating interactions that are pathogenic or mutualistic. Recent advancements in protein structure prediction have significantly accelerated the identification and functional predictions of these rapidly evolving effector proteins. This development enables scientists to generate testable hypotheses for functional validation using experimental approaches. Research frontiers in effector biology include understanding pathways through which effector proteins are secreted or translocated into host cells, their roles in manipulating host microbiomes, and their contribution to interacting with host immunity. Comparative effector repertoires among different fungal-host interactions can highlight unique adaptations, providing insights for the development of novel antifungal therapies and biocontrol strategies.

Human milk is a complex mix of nutritional and bioactive components that provide complete nutrition for the infant. However, we lack a systematic knowledge of the factors shaping milk composition and how milk variation influences infant health. Here, we used multi-omic profiling to characterize interactions between maternal genetics, milk gene expression, milk composition, and the infant fecal microbiome in 242 exclusively breastfeeding mother-infant pairs. We identified 487 genetic loci associated with milk gene expression unique to the lactating mammary gland, including loci that impacted breast cancer risk and human milk oligosaccharide concentration. Integrative analyses uncovered connections between milk gene expression and infant gut microbiome, including an association between the expression of inflammation-related genes with IL-6 concentration in milk and the abundance of Bifidobacteria in the infant gut. Our results show how an improved understanding of the genetics and genomics of human milk connects lactation biology with maternal and infant health.

## Urinary tract infections: pathogenesis, host susceptibility and emerging therapeutics.
 09.09.2024, _MR Timm, SK Russell, SJ Hultgren_


Urinary tract infections (UTIs), which include any infection of the urethra, bladder or kidneys, account for an estimated 400 million infections and billions of dollars in health-care spending per year. The most common bacterium implicated in UTI is uropathogenic Escherichia coli, but diverse pathogens including Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus and even yeast such as Candida species can also cause UTIs. UTIs occur in both women and men and in both healthy and immunocompromised patients. However, certain patient factors predispose to disease: for example, female sex, history of prior UTI, or the presence of a urinary catheter or other urinary tract abnormality. The current clinical paradigm for the treatment of UTIs involves the use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this approach is dwindling as the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance rises among UTI isolates, and the immense quantity of antibiotics prescribed annually for these infections contributes to the emergence of resistant pathogens. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibiotics and non-antibiotic treatment and prevention strategies. In this Review, we discuss how recent studies of bacterial pathogenesis, recurrence, persistence, host-pathogen interactions and host susceptibility factors have elucidated new and promising targets for the treatment and prevention of UTIs.

## Dietary-timing-induced gut microbiota diurnal oscillations modulate inflammatory rhythms in rheumatoid arthritis.
 11.09.2024, _F Ma, Z Li, H Liu, S Chen, S Zheng, J Zhu, H Shi, H Ye, Z Qiu, L Gao, B Han, Q Yang, X Wang, Y Zhang, L Cheng, H Fan, S Lv, X Zhao, H Zhou, J Li, M Hong_


Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition characterized by inflammatory activity with distinct rhythmic fluctuations. However, the precise mechanisms governing these inflammatory rhythms remain elusive. Here, we explore the interaction between dietary patterns, gut microbiota diurnal oscillations, and the rhythmicity of RA in both collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice and patients with RA and highlight the significance of dietary timing in modulating RA inflammatory rhythms linked to gut microbiota. Specifically, we discovered that Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis) uses β-glucosidase (β-GC) to release glycitein (GLY) from the diet in response to daily nutritional cues, influencing RA inflammatory rhythms dependent on the sirtuin 5-nuclear factor-κB (SIRT5-NF-κB) axis. Notably, we validated the daily fluctuations of P. distasonis-β-GC-GLY in patients with RA through continuous sampling across day-night cycles. These findings underscore the crucial role of dietary timing in RA rhythmicity and propose potential clinical implications for novel therapeutic strategies to alleviate arthritis.

Village chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are commonly reared in rural households of South Africa and other developing countries. They play a vital role as a primary source of protein through the provision of meat and eggs. The chicken gut microbiota plays an important role in chicken's immune system, its health, physiological development of the gut, digestion of food, nutrient absorption and productivity. Thus, it is imperative to critically investigate the chicken microbial composition in order to develop effective disease control measures and increase production. In this present study, microbial DNA was isolated from 34 non-descript mixed gender matured village chickens' intestinal contents followed by high throughput Illumina sequencing targeting 16S rRNA gene. Senwamokgope village had the largest microbiota composition as compared to Itieleni and Thakgalang villages. Overall, Firmicutes (74%) was the most abundant phylum observed, followed by Proteobacteria (8%), Actinobateria (5%), and Bacteroidota (3%). At the genus level, Lactobacillus was the dominant bacteria. Other genera found included Sphingomonas (7%), Cutibacterium (4%), and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 (2%). The richness of female intestinal microbiota was higher compared to the male microbiota. The findings of this study provide baseline information that can assist to better understand the chicken gut microbiota and its interaction with diseases and parasites.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are immune chronic diseases characterized by recurrent episodes, resulting in continuous intestinal barrier damage and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. Safe strategies aimed at stabilizing and reducing IBDs recurrence have been vigorously pursued. Here, we constructed a recurrent intestinal injury Drosophila model and found that vitamin B12 (VB12), an essential co-factor for organism physiological functions, could effectively protect the intestine and reduce dextran sulfate sodium-induced intestinal barrier disruption. VB12 also alleviated microbial dysbiosis in the Drosophila model and inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria. We demonstrated that VB12 could mitigate intestinal damage by activating the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling pathway in injured conditions, which was achieved by regulating the intestinal oxidation. In addition, we also validated the protective effect of VB12 in a murine acute colitis model. In summary, we offer new insights and implications for the potential supportive role of VB12 in the management of recurrent IBDs flare-ups.

Plant-associated microorganisms can be found in various plant niches and collectively comprise the plant microbiome. The plant microbiome assemblages have been extensively studied, primarily in model species. However, a deep understanding of the microbiome assembly associated with plant health is still needed. Ginger rhizome rot has been variously attributed to multiple individual causal agents. Due to its global relevance, we used ginger and rhizome rot as a model to elucidate the metabolome-driven microbiome assembly associated with plant health.

The past two decades has witnessed a remarkable increase in the number of microbial genomes retrieved from marine systems1,2. However, it has remained challenging to translate this marine genomic diversity into biotechnological and biomedical applications3,4. Here we recovered 43,191 bacterial and archaeal genomes from publicly available marine metagenomes, encompassing a wide range of diversity with 138 distinct phyla, redefining the upper limit of marine bacterial genome size and revealing complex trade-offs between the occurrence of CRISPR-Cas systems and antibiotic resistance genes. In silico bioprospecting of these marine genomes led to the discovery of a novel CRISPR-Cas9 system, ten antimicrobial peptides, and three enzymes that degrade polyethylene terephthalate. In vitro experiments confirmed their effectiveness and efficacy. This work provides evidence that global-scale sequencing initiatives advance our understanding of how microbial diversity has evolved in the oceans and is maintained, and demonstrates how such initiatives can be sustainably exploited to advance biotechnology and biomedicine.

## Stable biomarker discovery in multi-omics data via canonical correlation analysis.
 12.09.2024, _T Pusa, J Rousu_

Multi-omics analysis offers a promising avenue to a better understanding of complex biological phenomena. In particular, untangling the pathophysiology of multifactorial health conditions such as the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) could benefit from simultaneous consideration of several omics levels. However, taking full advantage of multi-omics data requires the adoption of suitable new tools. Multi-view learning, a machine learning technique that natively joins together heterogeneous data, is a natural source for such methods. Here we present a new approach to variable selection in unsupervised multi-view learning by applying stability selection to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We apply our method, StabilityCCA, to simulated and real multi-omics data, and demonstrate its ability to find relevant variables and improve the stability of variable selection. In a case study on an IBD microbiome data set, we link together metagenomics and metabolomics, revealing a connection between their joint structure and the disease, and identifying potential biomarkers. Our results showcase the usefulness of multi-view learning in multi-omics analysis and demonstrate StabilityCCA as a powerful tool for biomarker discovery.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches have revolutionized gut microbiome research and can provide strain-level resolution, but these techniques have limitations in that they are only semi-quantitative, suffer from high detection limits, and generate data that is compositional. The present study aimed to systematically compare quantitative PCR (qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for the absolute quantification of Limosilactobacillus reuteri strains in human fecal samples and to develop an optimized protocol for the absolute quantification of bacterial strains in fecal samples.
