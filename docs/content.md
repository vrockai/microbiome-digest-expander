## Intracellular Staphylococcus aureus persisters upon antibiotic exposure.
 07.05.2020, _F Peyrusson, H Varet, TK Nguyen, R Legendre, O Sismeiro, JY Coppée, C Wolz, T Tenson, F Van Bambeke_


Bacterial persister cells are phenotypic variants that exhibit a transient non-growing state and antibiotic tolerance. Here, we provide in vitro evidence of Staphylococcus aureus persisters within infected host cells. We show that the bacteria surviving antibiotic treatment within host cells are persisters, displaying biphasic killing and reaching a uniformly non-responsive, non-dividing state when followed at the single-cell level. This phenotype is stable but reversible upon antibiotic removal. Intracellular S. aureus persisters remain metabolically active but display an altered transcriptomic profile consistent with activation of stress responses, including the stringent response as well as cell wall stress, SOS and heat shock responses. These changes are associated with multidrug tolerance after exposure to a single antibiotic. We hypothesize that intracellular S. aureus persisters may constitute a reservoir for relapsing infection and could contribute to therapeutic failures.

## A toxic environment: a growing understanding of how microbial communities affect Shiga toxin expression by E. coli O157:H7.
 02.05.2020, _EM Nawrocki, HM Mosso, EG Dudley_


Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), including E. coli O157:H7, cause severe illness in humans due to production of Shiga toxin (Stx) and other virulence factors. Because Stx is coregulated with lambdoid prophage induction, its expression is especially susceptible to environmental cues. Infections with Stx-producing E. coli can be difficult to model due to the wide range of disease outcomes-some infections are relatively mild, while others have serious complications. Probiotic organisms, members of the gut microbiome, and organic acids can depress Stx production, in many cases by inhibiting the growth of EHEC strains. On the other hand, the factors currently known to amplify Stx act via their effect on the stx-converting phage. Here, we characterize two interactive mechanisms that increase Stx production by O157:H7 strains: first, direct interactions with phage-susceptible E. coli; and second, indirect amplification by secreted factors. Infection of susceptible strains by the stx-converting phage can expand the Stx-producing population in a human or animal host, and phage infection has been shown to modulate virulence in vitro and in vivo Acellular factors, particularly colicins and microcins, can kill O157:H7 cells but may also trigger Stx expression in the process. Colicins, microcins, and other bacteriocins have diverse cellular targets, and many such molecules remain uncharacterized. Identification of additional Stx-amplifying microbial interactions will improve our understanding of E. coli O157:H7 infections and help elucidate the intricate regulation of pathogenicity in EHEC strains.

## Gut microbiota derived metabolites contribute to intestinal barrier maturation at the suckling-to-weaning transition.
 30.04.2020, _M Beaumont, C Paës, E Mussard, C Knudsen, L Cauquil, P Aymard, C Barilly, B Gabinaud, O Zemb, S Fourre, R Gautier, C Lencina, H Eutamène, V Theodorou, C Canlet, S Combes_


In suckling mammals, the onset of solid food ingestion is coincident with the maturation of the gut barrier. This ontogenic process is driven by the colonization of the intestine by the microbiota. However, the mechanisms underlying the microbial regulation of the intestinal development in early life are not fully understood. Here, we studied the co-maturation of the microbiota (composition and metabolic activity) and of the gut barrier at the suckling-to-weaning transition by using a combination of experiments in vivo (suckling rabbit model), ex vivo (Ussing chambers) and in vitro (epithelial cell lines and organoids). The microbiota composition, its metabolic activity, para-cellular epithelial permeability and the gene expression of key components of the gut barrier shifted sharply at the onset of solid food ingestion in vivo, despite milk was still predominant in the diet at that time. We found that cecal content sterile supernatant (i.e. containing a mixture of metabolites) obtained after the onset of solid food ingestion accelerated the formation of the epithelial barrier in Caco-2 cells in vitro and our results suggested that these effects were driven by the bacterial metabolite butyrate. Moreover, the treatment of organoids with cecal content sterile supernatant partially replicated in vitro the effects of solid food ingestion on the epithelial barrier in vivo. Altogether, our results show that the metabolites produced by the microbiota at the onset of solid food ingestion contribute to the maturation of the gut barrier at the suckling-to-weaning transition. Targeting the gut microbiota metabolic activity during this key developmental window might therefore be a promising strategy to promote intestinal homeostasis.

## The Microbiome and the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis for CNS Clinical Pharmacology: Challenges in Specifying and Integrating In Vitro and In Silico Models.
 30.04.2020, _KG Hawkins, C Casolaro, JA Brown, DA Edwards, JP Wikswo_


The complexity of integrating microbiota into clinical pharmacology, environmental toxicology, and opioid studies arises from bidirectional and multi-scale interactions between humans and their many microbiota, notably those of the gut. Hosts and each microbiota are governed by distinct central dogmas, with genetics influencing transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Each microbiota's metabolome differentially modulates its own and the host's multi-omics. Exogenous compounds, e.g., drugs and toxins, often affect host multi-omics differently than microbiota multi-omics, shifting the balance between drug efficacy and toxicity. The complexity of the host-microbiota connection has been informed by current methods of in vitro bacterial cultures and in vivo mouse models, but they fail to elucidate mechanistic details. Together, in vitro organ-on-chip microphysiological models, multi-omics, and in silico computational models have the potential to supplement the established methods to help clinical pharmacologists and environmental toxicologists unravel the myriad of connections between the gut microbiota and host health and disease.

## Reciprocal immune benefit based on complementary production of antibiotics by the leech Hirudo verbana and its gut symbiont Aeromonas veronii.

The medicinal leech has established a long-term mutualistic association with Aeromonas veronii, a versatile bacterium which can also display free-living waterborne and fish- or human-pathogenic lifestyles. Here, we investigated the role of antibiotics in the dynamics of interaction between the leech and its gut symbiont Aeromonas. By combining biochemical and molecular approaches, we isolated and identified for the first time the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by the leech digestive tract and by its symbiont Aeromonas. Immunohistochemistry data and PCR analyses evidenced that leech AMP genes are induced in the gut epithelial cells when Aeromonas load is low (starved animals), while repressed when Aeromonas abundance is the highest (post blood feeding). The asynchronous production of AMPs by both partners suggests that these antibiotic substances (i) provide them with reciprocal protection against invasive bacteria and (ii) contribute to the unusual simplicity of the gut microflora of the leech. This immune benefit substantially reinforces the evidence of an evolutionarily stable association between H. verbana and A. veronii. Altogether these data may provide insights into the processes making the association with an Aeromonas species in the digestive tract either deleterious or beneficial.

## Analyzing the impact of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection on primary human macrophages by combined exploratory and targeted metabolomics.
 30.04.2020, _F Vrieling, S Kostidis, HP Spaink, MC Haks, OA Mayboroda, THM Ottenhoff, SA Joosten_


The pathogenic success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is tightly linked to its ability to recalibrate host metabolic processes in infected host macrophages. Since changes in cellular metabolic intermediates or pathways also affect macrophage function in response to pathogens, we sought to analyse specific metabolic alterations induced by Mtb infection. Stimulation of macrophages with Mtb lysate or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced a relative increase in glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation. Cellular metabolomics revealed that Mtb infection induced a distinct metabolic profile compared to LPS in both M1 and M2 macrophages. Specifically, Mtb infection resulted in elevated intracellular levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), creatine, creatine phosphate and glutathione compared to uninfected control macrophages. Correspondingly, RNA-sequencing datasets showed altered gene expression of key metabolic enzymes involved in NAD+, creatine, glucose and glutamine metabolism (e.g NAMPT, SLC6A8, HK2) in Mtb-infected M2 macrophages. These findings demonstrate clear modulation of host macrophage metabolic pathways by Mtb infection.

## Metabolome-Microbiome Crosstalk and Human Disease.
 06.05.2020, _KA Lee-Sarwar, J Lasky-Su, RS Kelly, AA Litonjua, ST Weiss_


In this review, we discuss the growing literature demonstrating robust and pervasive associations between the microbiome and metabolome. We focus on the gut microbiome, which harbors the taxonomically most diverse and the largest collection of microorganisms in the human body. Methods for integrative analysis of these "omics" are under active investigation and we discuss the advances and challenges in the combined use of metabolomics and microbiome data. Findings from large consortia, including the Human Microbiome Project and Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) and others demonstrate the impact of microbiome-metabolome interactions on human health. Mechanisms whereby the microbes residing in the human body interact with metabolites to impact disease risk are beginning to be elucidated, and discoveries in this area will likely be harnessed to develop preventive and treatment strategies for complex diseases.

## Staphylococcus aureus-induced proteomic changes in the mammary tissue of rats: A TMT-based study.
 04.05.2020, _L Cai, J Tong, Z Zhang, Y Zhang, L Jiang, X Hou, H Zhang_


Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important pathogens causing mastitis in dairy cows. The objective of this study was to establish a rat model of mastitis induced by S. aureus infection and to explore changes in the proteomes of mammary tissue in different udder states, providing a better understanding of the host immune response to S. aureus mastitis. On day 3 post-partum, 6 rats were randomly divided into two groups (n = 3), with either 100 μL of PBS (blank group) or a S. aureus suspension containing 2×107 CFU·mL-1 (challenge group) infused into the mammary gland duct. After 24 h of infection, the rats were sacrificed, and mammary gland tissue was collected. Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based technology was applied to compare the proteomes of healthy and mastitic mammary tissues. Compared with the control group, the challenge group had 555 proteins with significant differences in expression, of which 428 were significantly upregulated (FC&gt;1.2 and p&lt;0.05) and 127 were downregulated (FC&gt;0.83 and p&lt;0.05 or p&lt;0.01). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that upregulated differentially significant expressed proteins (DSEPs) were associated with mainly immune responses, including integrin alpha M, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4, and alpha-2-macroglobulin. This study is the first in which a rat model of S. aureus-induced mastitis was used to explore the proteins related to mastitis in dairy cows by TMT technology, providing a model for replication of dairy cow S. aureus-induced mastitis experiments.

## Surface runoff alters cave microbial community structure and function.
 06.05.2020, _MC Davis, MA Messina, G Nicolosi, S Petralia, MD Baker, CKS Mayne, CM Dinon, CJ Moss, BP Onac, JR Garey_


Caves formed by sulfuric acid dissolution have been identified worldwide. These caves can host diverse microbial communities that are responsible for speleogenesis and speleothem formation. It is not well understood how microbial communities change in response to surface water entering caves. Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatic tools were used to determine the impact of surface water on the microbial community diversity and function within a spring pool found deep in the Monte Conca Cave system in Sicily, Italy. Sulfur oxidizers comprised more than 90% of the microbial community during the dry season and were replaced by potential anthropogenic contaminants such as Escherichia and Lysinibacillus species after heavy rains. One sampling date appeared to show a transition between the wet and dry seasons when potential anthropogenic contaminants (67.3%), sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (13.6%), and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (6.5%) were all present within the spring pool.

## Sequence count data are poorly fit by the negative binomial distribution.
 30.04.2020, _S Hawinkel, JCW Rayner, L Bijnens, O Thas_


Sequence count data are commonly modelled using the negative binomial (NB) distribution. Several empirical studies, however, have demonstrated that methods based on the NB-assumption do not always succeed in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at its nominal level. In this paper, we propose a dedicated statistical goodness of fit test for the NB distribution in regression models and demonstrate that the NB-assumption is violated in many publicly available RNA-Seq and 16S rRNA microbiome datasets. The zero-inflated NB distribution was not found to give a substantially better fit. We also show that the NB-based tests perform worse on the features for which the NB-assumption was violated than on the features for which no significant deviation was detected. This gives an explanation for the poor behaviour of NB-based tests in many published evaluation studies. We conclude that nonparametric tests should be preferred over parametric methods.

## Pelvic Bone Deformity and Its Correlation with Acetabular Center-edge Angle.
 01.05.2020, _BD Roos, MV Roos, A Camisa Júnior, EMU Lima, DL Tisatto, MC Argoud_


Objective The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the pelvic bone deformities and its correlation with the acetabular center-edge (CE) angle. Methods Between August 2014 and April 2015, we prospectively evaluated patients aged between 20 and 60 years old. The exclusion criteria were: metabolic disease, previous hip or spine surgery, radiograph showing hip arthrosis ≥ Tönnis two, severe hip dysplasia, global acetabular overcoverage, acetabular crossover sign, hip deformities from slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) or Leg-Perthes-Calveé, and bad quality radiographs. At anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs, we have evaluated: the CE angle, the acetabular index (IA), the acetabular crossover sign, the vertical and horizontal superior and inferior pelvic axis (H1: Horizontal line 1, superior pelvic axis; H2: Horizontal line 2, superior pelvic axis; V1: Vertical line, superior pelvic axis; HR: Horizontal line, inferior pelvic axis; VR: Vertical line, inferior pelvic axis). The superior and inferior pelvic axis were considered asymmetric when there was a difference ≥ 5 mm between both sides. Patients were divided into two groups: control and group 1. Results A total of 228 patients (456 hips) were evaluated in the period. According to the established criteria, 93 patients were included. The mean age was 39.9 years old (20 to 60 years old, standard deviation [SD] = 10,5), and the mean CE angle in the right hip was 31.5° (20 o to 40°), and in the left 32.3° (20 o to 40°). The control group had 38 patients, with asymmetric H1 in 4 cases (10.5%), H2 in 5 (13.1%), V1 in 7 (18.4%), HR in 5 (13.1%) and VR in 1 (2.63%). Group 1 had 55 patients, with asymmetric H1 in 24 cases (43.6%), H2 in 50 (90.9%), V1 in 28 (50.9%), HR in 16 (29.09%) and VR in 8 (14.5%). Comparing both groups, there was statistical significance for H1, H2 and V1 asymmetry ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion In the present paper, we observed the correlation between variation in the acetabular CE angle and asymmetry of the superior hemipelvis. The present authors believe that a better understanding of the pelvic morphologic alterations allows a greater facility in the diagnosis of hip articular deformities.

## Characteristics of and Factors Influencing College Nursing Students' Willingness to Utilize mHealth for Health Promotion.
 21.03.2020, _S Sittig, C Hauff, RJ Graves, SG Williams, RC McDermott, S Fruh, H Hall, M Campbell, D Swanzy, T Wright, GM Hudson_


More than half of practicing nurses have suboptimal physical or mental health. Impaired health is associated with a 76% higher likelihood that nurses will make medical errors. Improving the health habits of nursing students is essential to shaping and sustaining health prior to joining the workforce. Technology such as mobile health applications holds great promise in facilitating behavioral change and encouraging healthy habits in nursing students. Identifying the predictors of willingness to use mobile health is essential to creating mobile health applications that will engage nursing students and promote sustainable usage. Evaluation of psychological, attitudinal, and health-related correlates of mobile health can highlight predictors of willingness to use mobile health, which can influence nursing students' utilization and long-term engagement with mobile health applications. Analysis of these correlates shows that psychological attributes, such as hope, play a role in the willingness to use and may facilitate engagement in the utilization of a mobile health application. Development of a mobile health application that increases hope and helps establish healthy habits may enable nursing students to remain healthy throughout their lives, creating a new generation of happier, healthier nurses and, ultimately, improving safety for patients under their care.
