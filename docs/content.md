## Bacterial Translocation as Inflammatory Driver in Crohn's Disease.
 25.09.2021, _R Linares, R Francés, A Gutiérrez, O Juanola_


Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract responsible for intestinal lesions. The multifactorial etiology attributed to CD includes a combination of environmental and host susceptibility factors, which result in an impaired host-microbe gut interaction. Bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis, increased intestinal barrier permeability, and altered inflammatory responses in patients with CD have been described in the past. Those events explain the pathogenesis of luminal translocation of bacteria or its products into the blood, a frequent event in CD, which, in turn, favors a sustained inflammatory response in these patients. In this review, we navigate through the interaction between bacterial antigen translocation, permeability of the intestinal barrier, immunologic response of the host, and genetic predisposition as a combined effect on the inflammatory response observed in CD. Several lines of evidence support that translocation of bacterial products leads to uncontrolled inflammation in CD patients, and as a matter of fact, the presence of gut bacterial genomic fragments at a systemic level constitutes a marker for increased risk of relapse among CD patients. Also, the significant percentage of CD patients who lose response to biologic therapies may be influenced by the translocation of bacterial products, which are well-known drivers of proinflammatory cytokine production by host immune cells. Further mechanistic studies evaluating cellular and humoral immune responses, gut microbiota alterations, and genetic predisposition will help clinicians to better control and personalize the management of CD patients in the future.

## TNF-α synergises with IFN-γ to induce caspase-8-JAK1/2-STAT1-dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells.

Rewiring of host cytokine networks is a key feature of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD). Th1-type cytokines-IFN-γ and TNF-α-occupy critical nodes within these networks and both are associated with disruption of gut epithelial barrier function. This may be due to their ability to synergistically trigger the death of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) via largely unknown mechanisms. In this study, through unbiased kinome RNAi and drug repurposing screens we identified JAK1/2 kinases as the principal and nonredundant drivers of the synergistic killing of human IECs by IFN-γ/TNF-α. Sensitivity to IFN-γ/TNF-α-mediated synergistic IEC death was retained in primary patient-derived intestinal organoids. Dependence on JAK1/2 was confirmed using genetic loss-of-function studies and JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs). Despite the presence of biochemical features consistent with canonical TNFR1-mediated apoptosis and necroptosis, IFN-γ/TNF-α-induced IEC death was independent of RIPK1/3, ZBP1, MLKL or caspase activity. Instead, it involved sustained activation of JAK1/2-STAT1 signalling, which required a nonenzymatic scaffold function of caspase-8 (CASP8). Further modelling in gut mucosal biopsies revealed an intercorrelated induction of the lethal CASP8-JAK1/2-STAT1 module during ex vivo stimulation of T cells. Functional studies in CD-derived organoids using inhibitors of apoptosis, necroptosis and JAKinibs confirmed the causative role of JAK1/2-STAT1 in cytokine-induced death of primary IECs. Collectively, we demonstrate that TNF-α synergises with IFN-γ to kill IECs via the CASP8-JAK1/2-STAT1 module independently of canonical TNFR1 and cell death signalling. This non-canonical cell death pathway may underpin immunopathology driven by IFN-γ/TNF-α in diverse autoinflammatory diseases such as IBD, and its inhibition may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of anti-TNFs and JAKinibs.

## The Prebiotic Potential of Inulin-type Fructans: A Systematic Review.
 23.09.2021, _RL Hughes, DA Alvarado, KS Swanson, HD Holscher_


Inulin-type fructans (ITF), including short-chain fructooligosaccharides (scFOS), oligofructose, and inulin, are commonly used fibers that are widely regarded as prebiotic for their ability to be selectively utilized by the intestinal microbiota to confer a health benefit. However, the literature thus far lacks a thorough discussion of the evidence from human clinical trials for the prebiotic effect of ITF, including both effects on the intestinal microbiota composition as well as the intestinal and extraintestinal (e.g., glucose homeostasis, lipids, mineral absorption and bone health, appetite and satiety, inflammation and immune function, and body composition) benefits. Additionally, there is a lack of discussion regarding aspects such as the effect of ITF chain length on its intestinal and extraintestinal effects. The overall objective of this systematic review was to summarize the prebiotic potential of ITF based on the results of human clinical trials in healthy adult populations. Evidence from studies included in the current review suggest that ITF have a prebiotic effect on the intestinal microbiota, promoting the abundances of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Beneficial health effects reported following ITF intake include improved intestinal barrier function, improved laxation, increased insulin sensitivity, decreased triglycerides and an improved lipid profile, increased absorption of calcium and magnesium, and increased satiety. While there is some evidence for differing effects of ITF based on chain length, lack of direct comparisons and detailed descriptions of physicochemical properties limit the ability to draw conclusions from human clinical studies. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota mediates or modifies the effects of ITF on human health and the contribution of individual factors such as age and metabolic health to move towards personalization of prebiotic application.

## Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics in microbiome investigations.
 23.09.2021, _A Bauermeister, H Mannochio-Russo, LV Costa-Lotufo, AK Jarmusch, PC Dorrestein_


Microbiotas are a malleable part of ecosystems, including the human ecosystem. Microorganisms affect not only the chemistry of their specific niche, such as the human gut, but also the chemistry of distant environments, such as other parts of the body. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics is one of the key technologies to detect and identify the small molecules produced by the human microbiota, and to understand the functional role of these microbial metabolites. This Review provides a foundational introduction to common forms of untargeted mass spectrometry and the types of data that can be obtained in the context of microbiome analysis. Data analysis remains an obstacle; therefore, the emphasis is placed on data analysis approaches and integrative analysis, including the integration of microbiome sequencing data.

## Gut microbiota depletion exacerbates cholestatic liver injury via loss of FXR signalling.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease of unknown aetiology for which there are no approved therapeutic options. Patients with PSC display changes in gut microbiota and in bile acid (BA) composition; however, the contribution of these alterations to disease pathogenesis remains controversial. Here we identify a role for microbiota-dependent changes in BA synthesis that modulates PSC pathophysiology. In a genetic mouse model of PSC, we show that loss of microbiota-mediated negative feedback control of BA synthesis results in increased hepatic BA concentrations, disruption of bile duct barrier function and, consequently, fatal liver injury. We further show that these changes are dependent on decreased BA signalling to the farnesoid X receptor, which modulates the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in BA synthesis, CYP7A1. Moreover, patients with advanced stages of PSC show suppressed BA synthesis as measured by serum C4 levels, which is associated with poor disease prognosis. Our preclinical data highlight the microbiota-dependent dynamics of BA metabolism in cholestatic liver disease, which could be important for future therapies targeting BA and gut microbiome interactions, and identify C4 as a potential biomarker to functionally stratify patients with PSC and predict disease outcomes.

## Chains of evidence from correlations to causal molecules in microbiome-linked diseases.
 24.09.2021, _SN Chaudhari, MD McCurry, AS Devlin_


Human-associated microorganisms play a vital role in human health, and microbial imbalance has been linked to a wide range of disease states. In this Review, we explore recent efforts to progress from correlative studies that identify microorganisms associated with human disease to experiments that establish causal relationships between microbial products and host phenotypes. We propose that successful efforts to uncover phenotypes often follow a chain of evidence that proceeds from (1) association studies; to (2) observations in germ-free animals and antibiotic-treated animals and humans; to (3) fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs); to (4) identification of strains; and then (5) molecules that elicit a phenotype. Using this experimental 'funnel' as our guide, we explore how the microbiota contributes to metabolic disorders and hypertension, infections, and neurological conditions. We discuss the potential to use FMTs and microbiota-inspired therapies to treat human disease as well as the limitations of these approaches.

## Host and microbiota metabolic signals in aging and longevity.
 24.09.2021, _Y Zhou, G Hu, MC Wang_


Aging is an inevitable biochemical process that adversely affects personal health and poses ever-increasing challenges to society. Recent research has revealed the crucial role of metabolism in regulating aging and longevity. During diverse metabolic processes, the host organism and their symbiotic partners-the microbiota-produce thousands of chemical products (metabolites). Emerging studies have uncovered specific metabolites that act as signaling molecules to actively regulate longevity. Here we review the latest progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which metabolites from the host and/or microbiota promote longevity. We also highlight state-of-the-art technologies for discovering, profiling and imaging aging- and longevity-regulating metabolites and for deciphering the molecular basis of their actions. The broad application of these technologies in aging research, together with future advances, will foster the systematic discovery of aging- and longevity-regulating metabolites and their signaling pathways. These metabolite signals should provide promising targets for developing new interventions to promote longevity and healthy aging.

## Fecal filtrate transplantation protects against necrotizing enterocolitis.
 23.09.2021, _A Brunse, L Deng, X Pan, Y Hui, JL Castro-Mejía, W Kot, DN Nguyen, JB Secher, DS Nielsen, T Thymann_


Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening gastrointestinal disorder afflicting preterm infants, which is currently unpreventable. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising preventive therapy, but the transfer of pathogenic microbes or toxic compounds raise concern. Removal of bacteria from donor feces by micropore filtering may reduce this risk of bacterial infection, while residual bacteriophages could maintain the NEC-preventive effects. We aimed to assess preclinical efficacy and safety of fecal filtrate transplantation (FFT). Using fecal material from healthy suckling piglets, we compared rectal FMT administration (FMT, n = 16) with cognate FFT by either rectal (FFTr, n = 14) or oro-gastric administration (FFTo, n = 13) and saline (CON, n = 16) in preterm, cesarean-delivered piglets as models for preterm infants. We assessed gut pathology and analyzed mucosal and luminal bacterial and viral composition using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and meta-virome sequencing. Finally, we used isolated ileal mucosa, coupled with RNA-Seq, to gauge the host response to the different treatments. Oro-gastric FFT completely prevented NEC, which was confirmed by microscopy, whereas FMT did not perform better than control. Oro-gastric FFT increased viral diversity and reduced Proteobacteria relative abundance in the ileal mucosa relative to control. An induction of mucosal immunity was observed in response to FMT but not FFT. As preterm infants are extremely vulnerable to infections, rational NEC-preventive strategies need incontestable safety profiles. We show in a clinically relevant animal model that FFT, as opposed to FMT, efficiently prevents NEC without any recognizable side effects.
