## Gut microbe-targeted choline trimethylamine lyase inhibition improves obesity via rewiring of host circadian rhythms.
 24.01.2022, _RC Schugar, CM Gliniak, LJ Osborn, W Massey, N Sangwan, A Horak, R Banerjee, D Orabi, RN Helsley, AL Brown, A Burrows, C Finney, KK Fung, FM Allen, D Ferguson, AD Gromovsky, C Neumann, K Cook, A McMillan, JA Buffa, JT Anderson, M Mehrabian, M Goudarzi, B Willard, TD Mak, AR Armstrong, G Swanson, A Keshavarzian, JC Garcia-Garcia, Z Wang, AJ Lusis, SL Hazen, JM Brown_


Obesity has repeatedly been linked to reorganization of the gut microbiome, yet to this point obesity therapeutics have been targeted exclusively toward the human host. Here we show that gut microbe-targeted inhibition of the trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) pathway protects mice against the metabolic disturbances associated with diet-induced obesity (DIO) or leptin deficiency (Lepob/ob). Small molecule inhibition of the gut microbial enzyme choline TMA-lyase (CutC) does not reduce food intake but is instead associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, improvement in glucose tolerance, and enhanced energy expenditure. We also show that gut microbial CutC inhibition is associated with reorganization of host circadian control of both phosphatidylcholine and energy metabolism. This study underscores the relationship between microbe and host metabolism and provides evidence that gut microbe-derived trimethylamine (TMA) is a key regulator of the host circadian clock. This work also demonstrates that gut microbe-targeted enzyme inhibitors have potential as anti-obesity therapeutics.

## Limited Evidence for Microbial Transmission in the Phylosymbiosis between Hawaiian Spiders and Their Microbiota.
 25.01.2022, _B Perez-Lamarque, H Krehenwinkel, RG Gillespie, H Morlon_


The degree of similarity between the microbiotas of host species often mirrors the phylogenetic proximity of the hosts. This pattern, referred to as phylosymbiosis, is widespread in animals and plants. While phylosymbiosis was initially interpreted as the signal of symbiotic transmission and coevolution between microbes and their hosts, it is now recognized that similar patterns can emerge even if the microbes are environmentally acquired. Distinguishing between these two scenarios, however, remains challenging. We recently developed HOME (host-microbiota evolution), a cophylogenetic model designed to detect vertically transmitted microbes and host switches from amplicon sequencing data. Here, we applied HOME to the microbiotas of Hawaiian spiders of the genus Ariamnes, which experienced a recent radiation on the archipelago. We demonstrate that although Hawaiian Ariamnes spiders display a significant phylosymbiosis, there is little evidence of microbial vertical transmission. Next, we performed simulations to validate the absence of transmitted microbes in Ariamnes spiders. We show that this is not due to a lack of detection power because of the low number of segregating sites or an effect of phylogenetically driven or geographically driven host switches. Ariamnes spiders and their associated microbes therefore provide an example of a pattern of phylosymbiosis likely emerging from processes other than vertical transmission. IMPORTANCE How host-associated microbiotas assemble and evolve is one of the outstanding questions of microbial ecology. Studies aiming at answering this question have repeatedly found a pattern of "phylosymbiosis," that is, a phylogenetic signal in the composition of host-associated microbiotas. While phylosymbiosis was often interpreted as evidence for vertical transmission and host-microbiota coevolution, simulations have now shown that it can emerge from other processes, including host filtering of environmentally acquired microbes. However, distinguishing the processes driving phylosymbiosis in nature remains challenging. We recently developed a cophylogenetic method that can detect vertical transmission. Here, we applied this method to the microbiotas of recently diverged spiders from the Hawaiian archipelago, which display a clear phylosymbiosis pattern. We found that none of the bacterial operational taxonomic units is vertically transmitted. We show with simulations that this result is not due to methodological artifacts. Thus, we provide a striking empirical example of phylosymbiosis emerging from processes other than vertical transmission.

## Parkinson's Disease Medication Alters Small Intestinal Motility and Microbiota Composition in Healthy Rats.
 25.01.2022, _SP van Kessel, A Bullock, G van Dijk, S El Aidy_


Parkinson's disease (PD) is known to be associated with altered gastrointestinal function and microbiota composition. To date, the effect of PD medication on the gastrointestinal function and microbiota, at the site of drug absorption, the small intestine, has not been studied, although it may represent an important confounder in reported microbiota alterations observed in PD patients. To this end, healthy (non-PD) wild-type Groningen rats were employed and treated with dopamine, pramipexole (in combination with levodopa-carbidopa), or ropinirole (in combination with levodopa-carbidopa) for 14 sequential days. Rats treated with dopamine agonists showed a significant reduction in small intestinal motility and an increase in bacterial overgrowth in the distal small intestine. Notably, significant alterations in microbial taxa were observed between the treated and vehicle groups; analogous to the changes previously reported in human PD versus healthy control microbiota studies. These microbial changes included an increase in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and a decrease in Lachnospiraceae and Prevotellaceae. Markedly, certain Lactobacillus species correlated negatively with levodopa levels in the systemic circulation, potentially affecting the bioavailability of levodopa. Overall, the study highlights a significant effect of PD medication intrinsically on disease-associated comorbidities, including gastrointestinal dysfunction and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as well as the gut microbiota composition. The results urge future studies to take into account the influence of PD medication per se when seeking to identify microbiota-related biomarkers for PD. IMPORTANCE Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is known to be associated with altered gastrointestinal function and microbiota composition. We previously showed that the gut bacteria harboring tyrosine decarboxylase enzymes interfere with levodopa, the main treatment for PD (S. P. van Kessel, A. K. Frye, A. O. El-Gendy, M. Castejon, A. Keshavarzian, G. van Dijk, and S. El Aidy, Nat Commun 10:310, 2019). Although PD medication could be an important confounder in the reported alterations, its effect, apart from the disease itself, on the microbiota composition or the gastrointestinal function at the site of drug absorption, the small intestine, has not been studied. The findings presented here show a significant impact of commonly prescribed PD medication on the small intestinal motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and microbiota composition, irrespective of the PD. Remarkably, we observed negative associations between bacterial species harboring tyrosine decarboxylase activity and levodopa levels in the systemic circulation, potentially affecting the bioavailability of levodopa. Overall, this study shows that PD medication is an important factor in determining gastrointestinal motility and, in turn, microbiota composition and may, partly, explain the differential abundant taxa previously reported in the cross-sectional PD microbiota human studies. The results urge future studies to take into account the influence of PD medication on gut motility and microbiota composition when seeking to identify microbiota-related biomarkers for PD.

## Multi-omics Analysis Revealed Coordinated Responses of Rumen Microbiome and Epithelium to High-Grain-Induced Subacute Rumen Acidosis in Lactating Dairy Cows.
 25.01.2022, _Y Mu, W Qi, T Zhang, J Zhang, S Mao_


Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is a major metabolic disease in lactating dairy cows caused by the excessive intake of high-concentrate diets. Here, we investigated the synergistic responses of rumen bacteria and epithelium to high-grain (HG)-induced SARA. Eight ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 2 groups for a 3-week experiment and fed either a conventional (CON) diet or an HG diet. The results showed that the HG-feeding cows had a thickened rumen epithelial papilla with edge injury and a decreased plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing results demonstrated that HG feeding caused changes in rumen bacterial structure and composition, which further altered rumen fermentation and metabolism. Cooccurrence network analysis revealed that the distribution of the diet-sensitive bacteria responded to the treatment (CON or HG) and that all diet-sensitive amplicon sequence variants showed low to medium degrees of cooccurrence. Metabolomics analysis indicated that the endothelial permeability-increasing factor prostaglandin E1 and the polyamine synthesis by-product 5'-methylthioadenosine were enriched under HG feeding. Transcriptome analysis suggested that cholesterol biosynthesis genes were upregulated in the rumen epithelium of HG cows. The gene expression changes, coupled with more substrate being available (total volatile fatty acids), may have caused an enrichment of intracellular cholesterol and its metabolites. All of these variations could coordinately stimulate cell proliferation, increase membrane permeability, and trigger epithelial inflammation, which eventually disrupts rumen homeostasis and negatively affects cow health. IMPORTANCE Dairy cows are economically important livestock animals that supply milk for humans. The cow's rumen is a complex and symbiotic ecosystem composed of diverse microorganisms, which has evolved to digest high-fiber diets. In modern dairy production, SARA is a common health problem due to overfeeding of high-concentrate diets for an ever-increasing milk yield. Although extensive studies have been conducted on SARA, it remains unclear how HG feeding affects rumen cross talk homeostasis. Here, we identified structural and taxonomic fluctuation for the rumen bacterial community, an enrichment of certain detrimental metabolites in rumen fluid, and a general upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in the rumen epithelium of HG-feeding cows by multi-omics analysis. Based on these results, we propose a speculation to explain cellular events of coordinated rumen bacterial and epithelial adaptation to HG diets. Our work provides new insights into the exploitation of molecular regulation strategies to treat and prevent SARA.

## Predicting fungal infection rate and severity with skin-associated microbial communities on amphibians.
 25.01.2022, _MY Chen, JG Kueneman, A González, G Humphrey, R Knight, VJ McKenzie_


Pathogen success (risk and severity) is influenced by host-associated microbiota, but the degree to which variation in microbial community traits predict future infection presence/absence (risk) and load (severity) for the host is unknown. We conducted a time-series experiment by sampling the skin-associated bacterial communities of five amphibian species before and after exposure to the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobaditis (Bd). We ask whether microbial community traits are predictors of, or are affected by, Bd infection risk and intensity. Our results show that richness of putative Bd-inhibitory bacteria strongly predicts infection risk, while the proportion of putative Bd-inhibitory bacteria predicts future infection intensity. Variation in microbial community composition is high across time and individual, and bacterial prevalence is low. Our findings demonstrate how ecological community traits of host-associated microbiota may be used to predict infection risk by pathogenic microbes.

## Commensal oral microbiota induces osteoimmunomodulatory effects separate from systemic microbiome in mice.
 25.01.2022, _JD Hathaway-Schrader, JD Aartun, NA Poulides, MB Kuhn, BE McCormick, ME Chew, E Huang, RP Darveau, C Westwater, CM Novince_


Commensal microbes critically regulate skeletal homeostasis, yet the impact of specific microbiota communities on osteoimmune response mechanisms is unknown. To discern osteoimmunomodulatory effects imparted by the commensal oral microbiota that are distinct from the systemic microbiota, osteoimmunology studies were performed in both alveolar bone and non-oral skeletal sites of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) vs. germ-free (GF) mice, and SPF mice subjected to saline vs. chlorhexidine oral rinses. SPF vs. GF mice had reduced cortical/trabecular bone and an enhanced pro-osteoclastic phenotype in alveolar bone. Toll-like receptor signaling and TH17 cells that have known pro-osteoclastic actions were increased in alveolar, but not long-bone marrow, of SPF vs. GF mice. MHC class-II antigen presentation genes, activated dendritic cells, and activated CD4+ T-cells were elevated in alveolar, but not long-bone marrow, of SPF vs. GF mice. These findings were substantiated by in vitro allostimulation studies demonstrating increased activated dendritic cells derived from alveolar, but not long-bone marrow, of SPF vs. GF mice. Chlorhexidine antiseptic rinse depleted the oral, but not gut, bacteriome in SPF mice. Findings from saline- vs. chlorhexidine-treated SPF mice corroborated outcomes from SPF vs. GF mice, which reveals that the commensal oral microbiota imparts osteoimmunomodulatory effects separate from the systemic microbiome.

## Shared features and reciprocal complementation of the Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis microbiota.
 21.01.2022, _P Durán, J Flores-Uribe, K Wippel, P Zhang, R Guan, B Melkonian, M Melkonian, R Garrido-Oter_


Microscopic algae release organic compounds to the region immediately surrounding their cells, known as the phycosphere, constituting a niche for colonization by heterotrophic bacteria. These bacteria take up algal photoassimilates and provide beneficial functions to their host, in a process that resembles the establishment of microbial communities associated with the roots and rhizospheres of land plants. Here, we characterize the microbiota of the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and reveal extensive taxonomic and functional overlap with the root microbiota of land plants. Using synthetic communities derived from C. reinhardtii and Arabidopsis thaliana, we show that phycosphere and root bacteria assemble into taxonomically similar communities on either host. We show that provision of diffusible metabolites is not sufficient for phycosphere community establishment, which additionally requires physical proximity to the host. Our data suggest the existence of shared ecological principles driving the assembly of the A. thaliana root and C. reinhardtii phycosphere microbiota, despite the vast evolutionary distance between these two photosynthetic organisms.

## A biogeographic 16S rRNA survey of bacterial communities of ureolytic biomineralization from California public restrooms.
 18.01.2022, _K Lim, M Rolston, S Barnum, C Wademan, H Leverenz_


In this study, we examined the total bacterial community associated with ureolytic biomineralization from urine drainage systems. Biomineral samples were obtained from 11 California Department of Transportation public restrooms fitted with waterless, low-flow, or conventional urinals in 2019. Following high throughput 16S rRNA Illumina sequences processed using the DADA2 pipeline, the microbial diversity assessment of 169 biomineral and urine samples resulted in 3,869 reference sequences aggregated as 598 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Using PERMANOVA testing, we found strong, significant differences between biomineral samples grouped by intrasystem sampling location and urinal type. Biomineral microbial community profiles and alpha diversities differed significantly when controlling for sampling season. Observational statistics revealed that biomineral samples obtained from waterless urinals contained the largest ureC/16S gene copy ratios and were the least diverse urinal type in terms of Shannon indices. Waterless urinal biomineral samples were largely dominated by the Bacilli class (86.1%) compared to low-flow (41.3%) and conventional samples (20.5%), and had the fewest genera that account for less than 2.5% relative abundance per OTU. Our findings are useful for future microbial ecology studies of urine source-separation technologies, as we have established a comparative basis using a large sample size and study area.
