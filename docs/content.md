Mankind has recognized the value of land plants as renewable sources of food, medicine, and materials for millennia. Throughout human history, agricultural methods were continuously modified and improved to meet the changing needs of civilization. Today, our rapidly growing population requires further innovation to address the practical limitations and serious environmental concerns associated with current industrial and agricultural practices. Microalgae are a diverse group of unicellular photosynthetic organisms that are emerging as next-generation resources with the potential to address urgent industrial and agricultural demands. The extensive biological diversity of algae can be leveraged to produce a wealth of valuable bioproducts, either naturally or via genetic manipulation. Microalgae additionally possess a set of intrinsic advantages, such as low production costs, no requirement for arable land, and the capacity to grow rapidly in both large-scale outdoor systems and scalable, fully contained photobioreactors. Here, we review technical advancements, novel fields of application, and products in the field of algal biotechnology to illustrate how algae could present high-tech, low-cost, and environmentally friendly solutions to many current and future needs of our society. We discuss how emerging technologies such as synthetic biology, high-throughput phenomics, and the application of internet of things (IoT) automation to algal manufacturing technology can advance the understanding of algal biology and, ultimately, drive the establishment of an algal-based bioeconomy.

Insulating strategies are indispensable for laboratory-scale composting reactors, however, current insulation methods interfere with the aerobic fermentation behaviors related to composting. To address this issue, a centre-oriented real-time temperature compensation strategy was designed in this study. Five 9 L reactors (R1-R5) with different insulation strategies were used for the co-composting of dewatered sludge and Phragmites australis and compared. The process performance was assessed by monitoring the temperature, O2 and CO2 emissions, the physical-chemical properties of the composting materials were evaluated by measuring the organic matter (OM), carbon nitrogen ratio (C/N), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra. And a 16S rDNA analysis was used to quantify the evolution of bacterial community. The main findings are as follows. Compared with R1 as a control, the insulating strategies can increase the maximum temperature and prolong the thermophilic phase of composting. Comparing R1 and R3 showed that real-time temperature compensation can better restore the real fermentation of the compost. The results showed that R5 had the best composting effect, reaching 69.8 Â°C, which was 25.1%, 29.7%, 19.3%, and 17.3% higher than R1, R2, R3, and R4, respectively, and remaining in the thermophilic phase for 4.24 d, which is 1.4, 1.5, 1.3, and 0.2 times longer than R1, R2, R3, and R4, respectively. Furthermore, it can significantly reduce the temperature difference between the centre and edge of the reactor, which improved the composting material allocation efficiency and composting process control accuracy, further providing a basis for the actual full-scale composting operation.

## Combining omics technologies with CRISPR-based genome editing to study food microbes.
 24.03.2020, _M Pan, R Barrangou_


The implementation of omics technologies such as genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of microbiomes, and shed light on the functional attributes and mechanisms of action underlying the ability of probiotics to impact host health and starter cultures to drive food fermentation. Recently, molecular machines from CRISPR-Cas systems have redefined the gene editing toolbox and democritized our ability to alter the genome of food microorganisms. An integrated approach in which CRISPR-based genome editing is informed by omics studies is poised to enable the engineering of microorganisms and the formulation of microbiomes impacting the food supply chain. Here, we highlight the current applications of omics technologies in food microorganisms and CRISPR-based genome editing technologies in bacteria, and discuss how this integrated approach enables effective engineering of food microbes to generate enhanced probiotic strains, develop novel biotherapeutics and alter microbial communities in food matrices.

## Stochasticity in microbiology: managing unpredictability to reach the Sustainable Development Goals.
 20.04.2020, _J De Vrieze, T De Mulder, S Matassa, J Zhou, LT Angenent, N Boon, W Verstraete_


Pure (single) cultures of microorganisms and mixed microbial communities (microbiomes) have been important for centuries in providing renewable energy, clean water and food products to human society and will continue to play a crucial role to pursue the Sustainable Development Goals. To use microorganisms effectively, microbial engineered processes require adequate control. Microbial communities are shaped by manageable deterministic processes, but also by stochastic processes, which can promote unforeseeable variations and adaptations. Here, we highlight the impact of stochasticity in single culture and microbiome engineering. First, we discuss the concepts and mechanisms of stochasticity in relation to microbial ecology of single cultures and microbiomes. Second, we discuss the consequences of stochasticity in relation to process performance and human health, which are reflected in key disadvantages and important opportunities. Third, we propose a suitable decision tool to deal with stochasticity in which monitoring of stochasticity and setting the boundaries of stochasticity by regulators are central aspects. Stochasticity may give rise to some risks, such as the presence of pathogens in microbiomes. We argue here that by taking the necessary precautions and through clever monitoring and interpretation, these risks can be mitigated.

## Microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of hypersaline sediments in Orca Basin.
 21.04.2020, _LM Nigro, FJ Elling, KU Hinrichs, SB Joye, A Teske_


In deep ocean hypersaline basins, the combination of high salinity, unusual ionic composition and anoxic conditions represents significant challenges for microbial life. We used geochemical porewater characterization and DNA sequencing based taxonomic surveys to enable environmental and microbial characterization of anoxic hypersaline sediments and brines in the Orca Basin, the largest brine basin in the Gulf of Mexico. Full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from hypersaline sediments and the overlying brine were dominated by the uncultured halophilic KB1 lineage, Deltaproteobacteria related to cultured sulfate-reducing halophilic genera, and specific lineages of heterotrophic Bacteroidetes. Archaeal clones were dominated by members of the halophilic methanogen genus Methanohalophilus, and the ammonia-oxidizing Marine Group I (MG-I) within the Thaumarchaeota. Illumina sequencing revealed higher phylum- and subphylum-level complexity, especially in lower-salinity sediments from the Orca Basin slope. Illumina and clone library surveys consistently detected MG-I Thaumarchaeota and halotolerant Deltaproteobacteria in the hypersaline anoxic sediments, but relative abundances of the KB1 lineage differed between the two sequencing methods. The stable isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon and methane in porewater, and sulfate concentrations decreasing downcore indicated methanogenesis and sulfate reduction in the anoxic sediments. While anaerobic microbial processes likely occur at low rates near their maximal salinity thresholds in Orca Basin, long-term accumulation of reaction products leads to high methane concentrations and reducing conditions within the Orca Basin brine and sediments.
