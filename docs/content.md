## Assessing the impact of storage time on the stability of stool microbiota richness, diversity, and composition.
 21.12.2021, _EA Holzhausen, M Nikodemova, CL Deblois, JH Barnet, PE Peppard, G Suen, KM Malecki_


New technologies like next-generation sequencing have led to a proliferation of studies investigating the role of the gut microbiome in human health, particularly population-based studies that rely upon participant self-collection of samples. However, the impact of methodological differences in sample shipping, storage, and processing are not well-characterized for these types of studies, especially when transit times may exceed 24 h. The aim of this study was to experimentally assess microbiota stability in stool samples stored at 4 °C for durations of 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h with no additives to better understand effects of variable shipping times in population-based studies. These data were compared to a baseline sample that was immediately stored at - 80 °C after stool production.
