_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Roughage and Dietary Influence on Liver Abscesses.
 15.10.2022, _TC Bryant, J Jennings_


Many researchers have evaluated different nonantibiotic, dietary interventions to reduce liver abscessation including degree of grain processing, roughage particle size, ionophore inclusion level, and supplemental prebiotics or probiotics; however, these alternatives have been inconsistent in outcomes and have not proven to be successful. New technologies and methodologies that allow for description and characterization of the microbiome within cattle, their environment, and liver abscesses themselves may help elucidate the etiology of liver abscess formation and allow for targeting interventions that will provide solutions to replace or reduce antimicrobial use that is currently used for the reduction of liver abscess prevalence.

## Dupilumab (Dupixent®) tends to be an effective therapy for uncontrolled severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps: real data of a single-centered, retrospective single-arm longitudinal study from a university hospital in Germany.
 15.10.2022, _F Jansen, B Becker, JK Eden, PC Breda, A Hot, T Oqueka, CS Betz, AS Hoffmann_


Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is an inflammatory disease, which is usually type 2-mediated in the western hemisphere, associated with severe therapeutic and socioeconomic challenges. The first targeted systemic treatment option for severe uncontrolled CRSwNP is a human monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) subunit called dupilumab, which was approved for subcutaneous administration in Germany in October 2019. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of dupilumab in real life in patients treated with dupilumab in label according to license in our department in 2019-2021.

## Microbiome epidemiology and association studies in human health.
 05.10.2022, _H VanEvery, EA Franzosa, LH Nguyen, C Huttenhower_


Studies of the human microbiome share both technical and conceptual similarities with genome-wide association studies and genetic epidemiology. However, the microbiome has many features that differ from genomes, such as its temporal and spatial variability, highly distinct genetic architecture and person-to-person variation. Moreover, there are various potential mechanisms by which distinct aspects of the human microbiome can relate to health outcomes. Recent advances, including next-generation sequencing and the proliferation of multi-omic data types, have enabled the exploration of the mechanisms that connect microbial communities to human health. Here, we review the ways in which features of the microbiome at various body sites can influence health outcomes, and we describe emerging opportunities and future directions for advanced microbiome epidemiology.

## The effects of fermented vegetable consumption on the composition of the intestinal microbiota and levels of inflammatory markers in women: A pilot and feasibility study.
 13.10.2022, _AE Galena, J Chai, J Zhang, M Bednarzyk, D Perez, JD Ochrietor, A Jahan-Mihan, AY Arikawa_


_Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Biomarkers, C-Reactive Protein, Feasibility Studies, Female, Fruit, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Lipopolysaccharides, Middle Aged, Pilot Projects, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Vegetables, Young Adult_
The primary objective of this pilot study was to investigate the feasibility of regular consumption of fermented vegetables for six weeks on markers of inflammation and the composition of the gut microflora in women (clinical trials ID: NTC03407794). Thirty-one women were randomized into one of three groups: 100 g/day of fermented vegetables (group A), 100 g/day pickled vegetables (group B), or no vegetables (group C) for six weeks. Dietary intake was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire and blood and stool samples were provided before and after the intervention for measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP). Next-generation sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Participants' ages ranged between 18 and 69 years. Both groups A and B had a mean daily consumption of 91g of vegetables for 32 and 36 days, respectively. Serum CRP ranged between 0.9 and 265 ng/mL (SD = 92.4) at baseline, while TNF-α and LBP concentrations ranged between 0 and 9 pg/mL (SD = 2.3), and 7 and 29 μg/mL (SD = 4.4), respectively. There were no significant changes in levels of inflammatory markers among groups. At timepoint 2, group A showed an increase in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P = 0.022), a decrease in Ruminococcus torques (P&lt;0.05), and a trend towards greater alpha diversity measured by the Shannon index (P = 0.074). The findings indicate that consumption of ~100 g/day of fermented vegetables for six weeks is feasible and may result in beneficial changes in the composition of the gut microbiota. Future trials should determine whether consumption of fermented vegetables is an effective strategy against gut dysbiosis.

## Development of synthetic selfish elements based on modular nucleases in Drosophila melanogaster.
 21.10.2021, _A Simoni, C Siniscalchi, YS Chan, DS Huen, S Russell, N Windbichler, A Crisanti_


_Animals, DNA, DNA End-Joining Repair, Drosophila melanogaster, Endodeoxyribonucleases, Female, Homologous Recombination, Male, Protein Engineering_
Selfish genes are DNA elements that increase their rate of genetic transmission at the expense of other genes in the genome and can therefore quickly spread within a population. It has been suggested that selfish elements could be exploited to modify the genome of entire populations for medical and ecological applications. Here we report that transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) can be engineered into site-specific synthetic selfish elements (SSEs) and demonstrate their transmission of up to 70% in the Drosophila germline. We show here that SSEs can spread via DNA break-induced homologous recombination, a process known as 'homing' similar to that observed for homing endonuclease genes (HEGs), despite their fundamentally different modes of DNA binding and cleavage. We observed that TALEN and ZFN have a reduced capability of secondary homing compared to HEG as their repetitive structure had a negative effect on their genetic stability. The modular architecture of ZFNs and TALENs allows for the rapid design of novel SSEs against specific genomic sequences making them potentially suitable for the genetic engineering of wild-type populations of animals and plants, in applications such as gene replacement or population suppression of pest species.

## 2-year clinical and radiographic outcomes following uncemented reverse shoulder replacements for proximal humerus fractures.
 15.10.2022, _S Chaudhury, R Myatt, T Aboelmagd, M Hussein, A Malhas_


Uncertainty remains regarding the role and long-term outcomes following uncemented reverse shoulder replacements (RSR) in managing displaced proximal humerus fractures (PHF). While RSRs for trauma have traditionally undergone cemented fixation of the humeral component, there is increasing interest in uncemented RSRs. Our primary aim was to evaluate 2-year outcomes following uncemented RSR fixation for 3 and 4-part PHFs in the elderly. A secondary aim was to evaluate if timing of surgery affected outcomes.

## Advancing human gut microbiota research by considering gut transit time.
 28.09.2022, _N Procházková, G Falony, LO Dragsted, TR Licht, J Raes, HM Roager_


Accumulating evidence indicates that gut transit time is a key factor in shaping the gut microbiota composition and activity, which are linked to human health. Both population-wide and small-scale studies have identified transit time as a top covariate contributing to the large interindividual variation in the faecal microbiota composition. Despite this, transit time is still rarely being considered in the field of the human gut microbiome. Here, we review the latest research describing how and why whole gut and segmental transit times vary substantially between and within individuals, and how variations in gut transit time impact the gut microbiota composition, diversity and metabolism. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota may causally affect gut motility. We argue that by taking into account the interindividual and intraindividual differences in gut transit time, we can advance our understanding of diet-microbiota interactions and disease-related microbiome signatures, since these may often be confounded by transient or persistent alterations in transit time. Altogether, a better understanding of the complex, bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and transit time is required to better understand gut microbiome variations in health and disease.

## Food Additive Emulsifiers and Their Impact on Gut Microbiome, Permeability, and Inflammation: Mechanistic Insights in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
 14.12.2021, _AS Bancil, AM Sandall, M Rossi, B Chassaing, JO Lindsay, K Whelan_


_Diet, Western, Emulsifying Agents, Food Additives, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Risk Factors_
The global burden of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] has increased over the 21st century. Despite multiple studies investigating the pathogenesis of IBD, the causative mechanisms pertaining to its increased prevalence remain unclear. There is growing evidence that aspects of a 'Western diet' increase the risk of developing IBD. More recently, evidence implicating dietary emulsifiers has accumulated, with ecological studies showing a positive correlation between inflammatory bowel disease and emulsifier consumption. Further to these, cell and animal studies have demonstrated plausible mechanisms by which dietary emulsifiers may contribute to IBD pathogenesis through mechanisms including: promotion of pro-inflammatory intestinal microbiota; disruption of mucus architecture; increased intestinal permeability; activation of inflammatory pathways; and disruption of the cell cycle. This review critically analyses the current evidence for these mechanisms that may be of pathological relevance to IBD, evaluates recent dietary trials, acknowledges the challenges of dietary intervention studies, and gives an overview of ongoing and future clinical trials in this important area.

## N-glycosylation of cervicovaginal fluid reflects microbial community, immune activity, and pregnancy status.
 14.10.2022, _G Wu, P Grassi, DA MacIntyre, BG Molina, L Sykes, S Kundu, CT Hsiao, KH Khoo, PR Bennett, A Dell, SM Haslam_


_Cytokines, Female, Glycosylation, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Mannose, Microbiota, Polysaccharides, Pregnancy, Premature Birth_
Human cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) is a complex, functionally important and glycan rich biological fluid, fundamental in mediating physiological events associated with reproductive health. Using a comprehensive glycomic strategy we reveal an extremely rich and complex N-glycome in CVF of pregnant and non-pregnant women, abundant in paucimannose and high mannose glycans, complex glycans with 2-4 N-Acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) antennae, and Poly-LacNAc glycans decorated with fucosylation and sialylation. N-glycosylation profiles were observed to differ in relation to pregnancy status, microbial composition, immune activation, and pregnancy outcome. Compared to CVF from women experiencing term birth, CVF from women who subsequently experienced preterm birth showed lower sialylation, which correlated to the presence of a diverse microbiome, and higher fucosylation, which correlated positively to pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration. This study is the first step towards better understanding the role of cervicovaginal glycans in reproductive health, their contribution to the mechanism of microbial driven preterm birth, and their potential for preventative therapy.

## Defending Earth's terrestrial microbiome.
 03.10.2022, _C Averill, MA Anthony, P Baldrian, F Finkbeiner, J van den Hoogen, T Kiers, P Kohout, E Hirt, GR Smith, TW Crowther_


Microbial life represents the majority of Earth's biodiversity. Across disparate disciplines from medicine to forestry, scientists continue to discover how the microbiome drives essential, macro-scale processes in plants, animals and entire ecosystems. Yet, there is an emerging realization that Earth's microbial biodiversity is under threat. Here we advocate for the conservation and restoration of soil microbial life, as well as active incorporation of microbial biodiversity into managed food and forest landscapes, with an emphasis on soil fungi. We analyse 80 experiments to show that native soil microbiome restoration can accelerate plant biomass production by 64% on average, across ecosystems. Enormous potential also exists within managed landscapes, as agriculture and forestry are the dominant uses of land on Earth. Along with improving and stabilizing yields, enhancing microbial biodiversity in managed landscapes is a critical and underappreciated opportunity to build reservoirs, rather than deserts, of microbial life across our planet. As markets emerge to engineer the ecosystem microbiome, we can avert the mistakes of aboveground ecosystem management and avoid microbial monocultures of single high-performing microbial strains, which can exacerbate ecosystem vulnerability to pathogens and extreme events. Harnessing the planet's breadth of microbial life has the potential to transform ecosystem management, but it requires that we understand how to monitor and conserve the Earth's microbiome.

## GTDB-Tk v2: memory friendly classification with the Genome Taxonomy Database.
 11.10.2022, _PA Chaumeil, AJ Mussig, P Hugenholtz, DH Parks_


The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) and associated taxonomic classification toolkit (GTDB-Tk) have been widely adopted by the microbiology community. However, the growing size of the GTDB bacterial reference tree has resulted in GTDB-Tk requiring substantial amounts of memory (∼320 GB) which limits its adoption and ease of use. Here we present an update to GTDB-Tk that uses a divide-and-conquer approach where user genomes are initially placed into a bacterial reference tree with family-level representatives followed by placement into an appropriate class-level subtree comprising species representatives. This substantially reduces the memory requirements of GTDB-Tk while having minimal impact on classification.

## binny: an automated binning algorithm to recover high-quality genomes from complex metagenomic datasets.
 14.10.2022, _O Hickl, P Queirós, P Wilmes, P May, A Heintz-Buschart_


The reconstruction of genomes is a critical step in genome-resolved metagenomics and for multi-omic data integration from microbial communities. Here, we present binny, a binning tool that produces high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG) from both contiguous and highly fragmented genomes. Based on established metrics, binny outperforms or is highly competitive with commonly used and state-of-the-art binning methods and finds unique genomes that could not be detected by other methods. binny uses k-mer-composition and coverage by metagenomic reads for iterative, nonlinear dimension reduction of genomic signatures as well as subsequent automated contig clustering with cluster assessment using lineage-specific marker gene sets. When compared with seven widely used binning algorithms, binny provides substantial amounts of uniquely identified MAGs and almost always recovers the most near-complete ($\gt 95\%$ pure, $\gt 90\%$ complete) and high-quality ($\gt 90\%$ pure, $\gt 70\%$ complete) genomes from simulated datasets from the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation initiative, as well as substantially more high-quality draft genomes, as defined by the Minimum Information about a Metagenome-Assembled Genome standard, from a real-world benchmark comprised of metagenomes from various environments than any other tested method.

With the advent of metagenomics, the importance of microorganisms and how their interactions are relevant to ecosystem resilience, sustainability, and human health has become evident. Cataloging and preserving biodiversity is paramount not only for the Earth's natural systems but also for discovering solutions to challenges that we face as a growing civilization.
