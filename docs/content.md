## The maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy and its role in maternal and infant health.
 17.04.2023, _T Sinha, S Brushett, J Prins, A Zhernakova_


There is growing knowledge that the maternal gut microbiome undergoes substantial changes during pregnancy. However, despite the recognition that the maternal gut microbiome influences maternal and infant health, we still have a limited understanding of the clinical and environmental factors that can impact the maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy and the consequences of these changes. Here, we review the current body of knowledge about factors shaping the maternal gut microbiome during pregnancy and its role in the development of pregnancy complications and infant health.

## Gardnerella Revisited: Species Heterogeneity, Virulence Factors, Mucosal Immune Responses, and Contributions to Bacterial Vaginosis.
 18.04.2023, _E Shvartsman, JE Hill, P Sandstrom, KS MacDonald_


Gardnerella species are associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and have been investigated as etiological agents of the condition. Nonetheless, the isolation of this taxon from healthy individuals has raised important questions regarding its etiological role. Recently, using advanced molecular approaches, the Gardnerella genus was expanded to include several different species that exhibit differences in virulence potential. Understanding the significance of these different species with respect to mucosal immunity and the pathogenesis and complications of BV could be crucial to solving the BV enigma. Here, we review key findings regarding the unique genetic and phenotypic diversity within this genus, virulence factors, and effects on mucosal immunity as they stand. We also comment on the relevance of these findings to the proposed role of Gardnerella in BV pathogenesis and in reproductive health and identify key gaps in knowledge that should be explored in the future.

## Intrahost evolution of the gut microbiota.
 17.04.2023, _HC Barreto, I Gordo_


A massive number of microorganisms, belonging to different species, continuously divide inside the guts of animals and humans. The large size of these communities and their rapid division times imply that we should be able to watch microbial evolution in the gut in real time, in a similar manner to what has been done in vitro. Here, we review recent findings on how natural selection shapes intrahost evolution (also known as within-host evolution), with a focus on the intestines of mice and humans. The microbiota of a healthy host is not as static as initially thought from the information measured at only one genomic marker. Rather, the genomes of each gut-colonizing species can be highly dynamic, and such dynamism seems to be related to the microbiota species diversity. Genetic and bioinformatic tools, and analysis of time series data, allow quantification of the selection strength on emerging mutations and horizontal transfer events in gut ecosystems. The drivers and functional consequences of gut evolution can now begin to be grasped. The rules of this intrahost microbiota evolution, and how they depend on the biology of each species, need to be understood for more effective development of microbiota therapies to help maintain or restore host health.

## Altered human gut virome in patients undergoing antibiotics therapy for Helicobacter pylori.

_Humans, Helicobacter pylori, Helicobacter Infections, Virome, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Drug Therapy, Combination_
Transient gut microbiota alterations have been reported after antibiotic therapy for Helicobacter pylori. However, alteration in the gut virome after H. pylori eradication remains uncertain. Here, we apply metagenomic sequencing to fecal samples of 44 H. pylori-infected patients at baseline, 6-week (N = 44), and 6-month (N = 33) after treatment. Following H. pylori eradication, we discover contraction of the gut virome diversity, separation of virome community with increased community difference, and shifting towards a higher proportion of core virus. While the gut microbiota is altered at 6-week and restored at 6-month, the virome community shows contraction till 6-month after the treatment with enhanced phage-bacteria interactions at 6-week. Multiple courses of antibiotic treatments further lead to lower virus community diversity when compared with treatment naive patients. Our results demonstrate that H. pylori eradication therapies not only result in transient alteration in gut microbiota but also significantly alter the previously less known gut virome community.

Effects of antibiotics on gut bacteria have been widely studied, but very little is known about the consequences of such treatments on the fungal microbiota (mycobiota). It is commonly believed that fungal load increases in the gastrointestinal tract following antibiotic treatment, but better characterization is clearly needed of how antibiotics directly or indirectly affect the mycobiota and thus the entire microbiota.

## Development of the gut microbiota in the first 14 years of life and its relations to internalizing and externalizing difficulties and social anxiety during puberty.
 18.04.2023, _Y Ou, C Belzer, H Smidt, C de Weerth_


Relations between the gut microbiota and host mental health have been suggested by a growing number of case-control and cross-sectional studies, while supporting evidence is limited in large community samples followed during an extended period. Therefore, the current preregistered study ( https://osf.io/8ymav , September 7, 2022) described child gut microbiota development in the first 14 years of life and explored its relations to internalizing and externalizing difficulties and social anxiety in puberty, a period of high relevance for the development of mental health problems. Fecal microbiota composition was analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing in a total of 1003 samples from 193 children. Through a clustering method, four distinct microbial clusters were newly identified in puberty. Most children within three of these clusters remained in the same clusters from the age of 12 to 14 years, suggesting stability in microbial development and transition during this period. These three clusters were compositionally similar to enterotypes (i.e., a robust classification of the gut microbiota based on its composition across different populations) enriched in Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus, respectively. Two Prevotella 9-predominated clusters, including one reported by us earlier in middle childhood and the other one in puberty, were associated with more externalizing behavior at age 14. One Faecalibacterium-depleted pubertal cluster was related to more social anxiety at age 14. This finding was confirmed by a negative cross-sectional relation between Faecalibacterium and social anxiety in the 14-year-olds. The findings of this study continue to map gut microbiota development in a relatively large community sample followed from birth onwards, importantly extending our knowledge to puberty. Results indicate that Prevotella 9 and Faecalibacterium may be relevant microbial taxa in relation to externalizing behavior and social anxiety, respectively. These correlational findings need validations from other similar cohort studies, as well as well-designed mechanistic pre-clinical investigations before inferring cause and effect.

## Reconstructing the landscape of gut microbial species across 29,000 diverse individuals.
 18.04.2023, _I Segota, JD Watrous, ED Kantz, S Nallamshetty, S Tiwari, S Cheng, M Jain, T Long_


The human gut microbiome has been linked to health and disease. Investigation of the human microbiome has largely employed 16S amplicon sequencing, with limited ability to distinguish microbes at the species level. Herein, we describe the development of Reference-based Exact Mapping (RExMap) of microbial amplicon variants that enables mapping of microbial species from standard 16S sequencing data. RExMap analysis of 16S data captures ∼75% of microbial species identified by whole-genome shotgun sequencing, despite hundreds-fold less sequencing depth. RExMap re-analysis of existing 16S data from 29,349 individuals across 16 regions from around the world reveals a detailed landscape of gut microbial species across populations and geography. Moreover, RExMap identifies a core set of fifteen gut microbes shared by humans. Core microbes are established soon after birth and closely associate with BMI across multiple independent studies. RExMap and the human microbiome dataset are presented as resources with which to explore the role of the human microbiome.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a serious public health issue globally, currently, the treatment of NAFLD lies still in the labyrinth. In the inchoate stage, the combinatorial application of food regimen and favorable gut microbiota (GM) are considered as an alternative therapeutic. Accordingly, we integrated secondary metabolites (SMs) from GM and Avena sativa (AS) known as potent dietary grain to identify the combinatorial efficacy through network pharmacology.

## Effects of Extended Cage Component Sanitation Interval on the Microenvironment, Health, and Gastrointestinal Microbiome of Rats (Rattus norvegicus).
 19.04.2023, _JZ Taylor, DL Fong, LM Habenicht, MK Fink, JK Leszczynski, DN Frank, JM Kofonow, CE Robertson, AG Nicklawsky, MJ Schurr, CJ Manuel_


Washing and sanitizing rodent cage components requires costly equipment, significant personnel effort, and use of natural resources. The benchmark frequency for sanitation of individually ventilated caging (IVC) has traditionally been every 2 wk. In this study, we investigated the effects of extending this interval on the cage microenvironment, basic markers of health, and the gastrointestinal microbiota of rats. We compared our institutional standard of changing the sanitation interval for rat cage lids, box feeders, and enrichment devices from every 4 wk to an interval of 12 wk. The cage bottom and bedding continued to be changed every 2 wk for both groups. We hypothesized that we would find no significant difference between our current practice of 4 wks and continuous use for 12 wk. Our data showed that intracage ammonia levels remained below 5 ppm for most cages in both groups, with the exception of cages that experienced a cage flood. We found no significant difference between groups in bacterial colony forming units (CFU) on cage components. We used 3 novel methods of assessing cleanliness of enrichment devices and found no significant effect of continuous use for 12 wk on the number of CFU. In addition, we found no significant differences between groups for animal weight, routine blood work, or fecal and cecal microbiomes. These data indicate that a sanitation interval of up to 12 wk for components of rat IVC caging has no significant effects on the microenvironment or health of rats. Using the longer interval will improve efficiency, reduce the use of natural resources, and decrease costs while maintaining high-quality animal care.

Gut microbiota is established to be associated with the diversity of gastrointestinal conditions, but information on the variation associated with music and gut microbes is limited. Current study revealed the impacts of music intervention during feeding on the growth performance and gut microbes of mice by using clinical symptoms and 16S rRNA sequencing techniques. The results showed that feeding mice with music had a significant increase in body weight after the 25th day. The Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most dominant phylum in the gut microbiota. Also, the relative abundance of the dominant bacteria was variable after musical intervention. In contrast to the control group, a significant decrease in alpha diversity analysis of gut bacterial microorganisms and Metastats analysis showed a significant increase in the relative abundance of 5 genera and one phylum after the music intervention. Moreover, the musical intervention during feeding caused modifications in the gut microbial composition of mice, as evidenced by an increase in the level of Firmicutes and Lactobacillus, while decreases the richness of pathogenic bacteria, e.g. Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Muribaculaceae, etc. In summary, music intervention increased body weight and enhanced the abundance of beneficial bacteria by reducing the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in gut microbiota of mice.
