Adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic autoinflammatory disease, characterised by fever, arthritis, and skin rash, and joint involvement is one of its clinical manifestations. The aims of this work were to assess joint involvement, to describe main patterns of involvement, and associated clinical characteristics. In this work, we aimed at assessing the joint involvement in AOSD by using MRI, to describe main patterns and associated clinical characteristics. In addition, we aimed at assessing the global transcriptomic profile of synovial tissues in AOSD to elucidate possible pathogenic pathways involved. We also evaluated the global transcriptomic profile of synovial tissues to elucidate possible pathogenic pathways involved in the disease. Thus, AOSD patients, who underwent to MRI exam on joints, were assessed to describe patterns of joint involvement and associated clinical characteristics. Some synovial tissues were collected for RNA-sequencing purposes. The most common MRI finding was the presence of synovitis on 60.5%, mainly in peripheral affected joints, with low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-fat-saturated weighted and STIR images. Bone oedema and MRI-bone erosions were reported on 34.9% and 25.6% MRI exams, respectively. Patients with MRI-bone erosions showed a higher prevalence of splenomegaly, a more frequent chronic disease course, lower levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and ferritin. In AOSD synovial tissues, a hyper-expression of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and TNF pathways was shown together with ferritin genes. In conclusion, in AOSD patients, the most common MRI-finding was the presence of synovitis, characterised by intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-fat-saturated weighted and STIR images. MRI-bone erosions and bone oedema were also observed. In AOSD synovial tissues, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF pathways together with ferritin genes resulted to be hyper-expressed.

## Updated Treatment for Acne: Targeted Therapy Based on Pathogenesis.
 11.06.2021, _I Kurokawa, AM Layton, R Ogawa_


Previous approaches to acne management have focused on the four main factors implicated in acne, namely, androgen-mediated sebogenesis (considered integral to acne), hyperkeratinization, colonization with Cutibacterium acnes, and inflammation related to both innate and adaptive mechanisms. Recent advances have facilitated potential novel approaches to acne management, as the pathophysiology and the immunological aspects related to acne and wound healing have evolved. Particular targets that have been shown to be closely involved in acne pathophysiology and wound healing include interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Biological antibodies targeting IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23, and TNFα could provide novel approaches for treating severe acne and related disorders. Acne is primarily a disease associated with sebogenesis. Monosaturated free acids are important components. Insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) promotes the proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes and IL-1β. Research into the microbiome may also provide insights into potential future therapeutic options for acne. Scars, both atrophic and hypertrophic, are common sequelae to acne. Risk factors associated with the development of acne scars include genetic, systemic, local, and lifestyle factors. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to play a crucial role in the development of acne-induced hypertrophic scars. Treatment for extensive inflammatory keloid scarring is limited. Surgery and postoperative radiotherapy are two possible options. Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), IGF-1, and B cells are found in keloid or hypertrophic scar tissues. Biological antibodies targeting these cytokines may be a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of this type of scar in the future. Future treatment for acne should embrace approaches that target the main etiological factors of acne. In particular, specific emphasis on aggressive treatment in the acute inflammatory phase to reduce the likelihood of scarring and other clinical sequelae, such as pigmentary changes would be highly desirable. Treatment for established acne-induced sequelae should also be considered.

## Cellular and molecular mediators of lymphangiogenesis in inflammatory bowel disease.
 14.06.2021, _DKW Ocansey, B Pei, X Xu, L Zhang, CV Olovo, F Mao_


Recent studies reporting the intricate crosstalk between cellular and molecular mediators and the lymphatic endothelium in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) suggest altered inflammatory cell drainage and lymphatic vasculature, implicating the lymphatic system as a player in the occurrence, development, and recurrence of intestinal diseases. This article aims to review recent data on the modulatory functions of cellular and molecular components of the IBD microenvironment on the lymphatic system, particularly lymphangiogenesis. It serves as a promising therapeutic target for IBD management and treatment. The interaction with gut microbiota is also explored.

## Host specific endophytic microbiome diversity and associated functions in three varieties of scented black rice are dependent on growth stage.
 15.06.2021, _KM Singha, B Singh, P Pandey_


The compositional and functional role of the endophytic bacterial community, associated with black scented rice, in correlation with its antioxidant property has been elucidated. Community dissimilarity analysis confirmed the overlapping of community in shoot and root tissues at the young stage, but not in mature plants. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum, in which Agrobacterium, Pleomorphomonas, Bradyrhizobium, Novasphingobium, Caulobacter were the most abundant genera, followed by Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetes in all three different varieties of the black rice. The antioxidant activity of mature plants was found to be higher in comparison to young plants. Intrinsically, the relative abundance of Pleomorphomonas and Streptomyces was positively correlated with total phenol content, while Gemmata, unclassified Pirellulaceae, unclassified Stramenopiles positively correlated with total flavonoid content and negatively correlated with Free radical scavenging activity. Accordingly, functional metagenome analysis of the endophytic microbiome revealed that naringenin -3-dioxygenase and anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase for phenylpropanoid (flavonoid and anthocyanin) synthesis were abundant in the endophytic microbiome of mature plants. Specific enrichment of the antioxidant producing genes in the mature plant endophytic microbiome was assigned to some bacteria such as Streptomyces, Pantoea which might have contributed to the common pathway of flavonoid synthesis. The genomes of endophytic isolates Kluyvera sp.PO2S7, Bacillus subtilis AMR1 and Enterobacter sp. SES19 were sequenced and annotated, and were found to have genes for phenylpropanoid synthesis in their genomes.

## Constraining PERMANOVA and LDM to within-set comparisons by projection improves the efficiency of analyses of matched sets of microbiome data.
 13.06.2021, _Z Zhu, GA Satten, C Mitchell, YJ Hu_


Matched-set data arise frequently in microbiome studies. For example, we may collect pre- and post-treatment samples from a set of individuals, or use important confounding variables to match data from case participants to one or more control participants. Thus, there is a need for statistical methods for data comprised of matched sets, to test hypotheses against traits of interest (e.g., clinical outcomes or environmental factors) at the community level and/or the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level. Optimally, these methods should accommodate complex data such as those with unequal sample sizes across sets, confounders varying within sets, and continuous traits of interest.

## Interrogating the bovine reproductive tract metagenomes using culture-independent approaches: a systematic review.
 16.06.2021, _CT Ong, C Turni, PJ Blackall, G Boe-Hansen, BJ Hayes, AE Tabor_


Undesirable microbial infiltration into the female bovine reproductive tracts, for example during calving or mating, is likely to disturb the commensal microflora. Persistent establishment and overgrowth of certain pathogens induce reproductive diseases, render the female bovine reproductive tract unfavourable for pregnancy or can result in transmission to the foetus, leading to death and abortion or birth abnormalities. This review of culture-independent metagenomics studies revealed that normal microflora in the female bovine reproductive tract is reasonably consistently dominated by bacteria from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, following by Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Tenericutes. Reproductive disease development in the female bovine reproductive tract was demonstrated across multiple studies to be associated with high relative abundances of bacteria from the phyla Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. Reduced bacterial diversity in the reproductive tract microbiome in some studies of cows diagnosed with reproductive diseases also indicated an association between dysbiosis and bovine reproductive health. Nonetheless, the bovine genital tract microbiome remains underexplored, and this is especially true for the male genital tract. Future research should focus on the functional aspects of the bovine reproductive tract microbiomes, for example their contributions to cattle fertility and susceptibility towards reproductive diseases.

Profiling of oral microbiota has traditionally been performed using conventional methods. These methods are relatively time-consuming and labor-intensive. Metagenomic analysis of oral microbiota using high-speed next-generation sequencing is a highly promising technology. However, it is expensive. This study sought to develop a simple and cost-effective profiling method for oral microbiota using 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes.

## Organoids and organs-on-chips: Insights into human gut-microbe interactions.
 11.06.2021, _J Puschhof, C Pleguezuelos-Manzano, H Clevers_


The important and diverse roles of the gut microbiota in human health and disease are increasingly recognized. The difficulty of inferring causation from metagenomic microbiome sequencing studies and from mouse-human interspecies differences has prompted the development of sophisticated in vitro models of human gut-microbe interactions. Here, we review recent advances in the co-culture of microbes with intestinal and colonic epithelia, comparing the rapidly developing fields of organoids and organs-on-chips with other standard models. We describe how specific individual processes by which microbes and epithelia interact can be recapitulated in vitro. Using examples of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, we highlight the advantages of each culture model and discuss current trends and future possibilities to build more complex co-cultures.

Silicon dioxide nanoparticles (SiO2NPs) are widely used as additive in the food industry with controversial health risk. Gut microbiota is a new and hot topic in the field of nanotoxicity. It also contributes a novel and insightful view to understand the potential health risk of food-grade SiO2NPs in children, who are susceptible to the toxic effects of nanoparticles.

## Decay of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and surrogates in aquatic environments.
 16.06.2021, _L Sala-Comorera, LJ Reynolds, NA Martin, JJ O'Sullivan, WG Meijer, NF Fletcher_


The introduction of SARS-CoV-2 containing human stool and sewage into water bodies may raise public health concerns. However, assessment of public health risks by faecally contaminated water is limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the persistence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in water. In the present study the decay rates of viable infectious SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA were determined in river and seawater at 4 and 20°C. These decay rates were compared to S. typhimurium bacteriophage MS2 and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV). Persistence of viable SARS-CoV-2 was temperature dependent, remaining infectious for significantly longer periods of time in both freshwater and seawater at 4°C than at 20°C. T90 for infectious SARS-CoV-2 in river water was 2.3 days and 3.8 days at 20°C and 4°C, respectively. The T90 values were 1.1 days and 2.2 days in seawater at 20°C and 4°C, respectively. In contrast to the rapid inactivation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in river and sea water, viral RNA was relatively stable. The RNA decay rates were increased in non-sterilised river and seawater, presumably due to the presence of microbiota. The decay rates of infectious MS2, MS2 RNA and PMMoV RNA differed significantly from the decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting that their use as surrogate markers for the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment is limited.
