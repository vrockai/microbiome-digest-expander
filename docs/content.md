## Mechanisms That Shape Microbial Pangenomes.
 11.01.2021, _MR Domingo-Sananes, JO McInerney_


Analyses of multiple whole-genome sequences from the same species have revealed that differences in gene content can be substantial, particularly in prokaryotes. Such variation has led to the recognition of pangenomes, the complete set of genes present in a species - consisting of core genes, present in all individuals, and accessory genes whose presence is variable. Questions now arise about how pangenomes originate and evolve. We describe how gene content variation can arise as a result of the combination of several processes, including random drift, selection, gain/loss balance, and the influence of ecological and epistatic interactions. We believe that identifying the contributions of these processes to pangenomes will need novel theoretical approaches and empirical data.

## Lessons learned from the prenatal microbiome controversy.
 15.01.2021, _MJ Blaser, S Devkota, KD McCoy, DA Relman, M Yassour, VB Young_


For more than a century, the prenatal environment was considered sterile. Over the last few years, findings obtained with next-generation sequencing approaches from samples of the placenta, the amniotic fluid, meconium, and even fetal tissues have challenged the dogma of a sterile womb, and additional reports have emerged that used culture, microscopy, and quantitative PCR to support the presence of a low-biomass microbial community at prenatal sites. Given the substantial implications of prenatal exposure to microbes for the development and health of the host, the findings have gathered substantial interest from academics, high impact journals, the public press, and funding agencies. However, an increasing number of studies have challenged the prenatal microbiome identifying contamination as a major issue, and scientists that remained skeptical have pointed to inconsistencies with in utero colonization, the impact of c-sections on early microbiome assembly, and the ability to generate germ-free mammals. A lively academic controversy has emerged on the existence of the wider importance of prenatal microbial communities. Microbiome has asked experts to discuss these issues and provide their thoughts on the implications. To allow for a broader perspective of this discussion, we have specifically selected scientists, who have a long-standing expertise in microbiome sciences but who have not directly been involved in the debate so far.

## The etiology and management of recurrent urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women.
 01.06.2020, _C Jung, L Brubaker_


_Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Epithelium, Estrogen Replacement Therapy, Estrogens, Female, Humans, Microbiota, Middle Aged, Postmenopause, Recurrence, Risk Factors, Urinary Tract Infections, Urogenital System_
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections and affect up to 50% of women in their lifetime, with almost half of these women experiencing a recurrence in 6-12 months. Menopause predisposes women to recurrent UTI (rUTI), as normally lower levels of estrogen lead to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently urogenital microbiome. The recently discovered urobiome is now known to have different compositions in both healthy and unhealthy bladders, including a role in the pathophysiology of rUTI, and may be a therapeutic target for prevention and treatment options for rUTI. In postmenopausal women with frequent UTI, the diagnosis of acute UTI should be made using a combination of the symptom assessment and urine diagnostic studies. The choice of UTI antibiotic should include consideration of efficacy, collateral effects, and side-effects. Some women may be candidates for self-start therapy, in which the patient accurately recognizes her UTI symptoms and then starts previously prescribed antibiotics. A large component of the management of women with rUTI is prevention. Urobiome research for bladder health and disease is a young field of investigation with significant potential to improve care for postmenopausal women affected by rUTI through novel, evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies.

## Alterations in Urobiome in Patients With Bladder Cancer and Implications for Clinical Outcome: A Single-Institution Study.
 02.01.2021, _J Zeng, G Zhang, C Chen, K Li, Y Wen, J Zhao, P Wu_


Numerous studies indicate that resident microbiome exists in urine of healthy individuals and dysbiosis of the urobiome (urinary microbiome) may be associated with pathological conditions. This study was performed to characterize the alterations in urobiome and explore its implications of clinical outcome in male patients with bladder cancer. 62 male patients with bladder cancer and 19 non-neoplastic controls were recruited. The follow-up study cohort included 40 patients who were diagnosed with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Mid-stream urine samples were collected from all the participants the day before cystoscopy. DNA was extracted from urine pellet samples and processed for high throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4 region using Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing reads were filtered using QIIME and clustered using UPARSE. We found bacterial richness indices (Observed Species index, Chao1 index, Ace index; all P &lt; 0.01) increased in cancer group when compared with non-neoplastic group, while there were no differences in Shannon and Simpson index between two groups. During a median follow-up time of 12 (5.25-25) months, 5/40 (12.5%)of the patients developed recurrence and no patient suffered from progression to muscle-invasive disease. Species diversity of the microbiome was significantly higher in the recurrence group compared with non-recurrence group in patients with NMIBC after TURBT. The LEfSe analysis demonstrated that 9 genera were increased (e.g., Micrococcus and Brachybacterium) in recurrence group. To our knowledge we report the relative comprehensive study to date of the male bladder cancer urinary microbiome and its relationship to pathogenesis and clinical outcomes. Given our preliminary data, additional studies evaluating the urine microbiome in relation to clinical outcomes are warranted to improve our understanding of tumor recurrence after TURBT.

## Amylases in the Human Vagina.
 14.01.2021, _KL Nunn, GC Clair, JN Adkins, K Engbrecht, T Fillmore, LJ Forney_


Dominance of Lactobacillus species in vaginal communities is a hallmark of healthy conditions in the female genital tract. Key nutrients for lactobacilli include sugars produced when glycogen is degraded by α-amylase in the vagina. While α-amylase activity has been demonstrated in vaginal fluids, it is unclear whether α-amylases are produced solely by the host, bacteria in the vagina, or both. We screened cervicovaginal mucus from 23 reproductive-age women, characterized the species composition of vaginal communities, measured vaginal pH, and determined levels of amylase activity, glycogen, and lactic acid. Based on differences in these measured variables, one sample from each of four individual donors was selected for metagenomic and proteomic analyses. Of eight putative bacterial amylases identified in the assembled bacterial metagenomes, we detected four in vaginal fluids. These amylases were produced by various bacteria in different vaginal communities. Moreover, no two communities were the same in terms of which bacteria were producing amylases. Although we detected bacterial amylases in vaginal fluids, there was no clear association between the bacterial species that was dominant in a community and the level of amylase activity. This association was likely masked by the presence of human α-amylase, which was also detected in vaginal fluids. Finally, the levels of amylase activity and glycogen were only weakly associated. Our findings show, for the first time, that multiple amylases from both bacterial and human origins can be present simultaneously in the vagina. This work also suggests that the link between glycogen, amylase, and Lactobacillus in the vagina is complex.IMPORTANCE In this study, we show that multiple bacteria in the vaginal community produce amylases that hydrolyze glycogen into simpler sugars (i.e., maltose and maltotriose). These sugars serve as "common goods" that sustain bacterial populations in vaginal communities. Given the temporal changes that are observed in the human vaginal microbiome, we expect the kinds of bacterial amylases produced will also vary over time. These differences influence the pool of resources that are broadly shared and shape the species composition of the vaginal bacterial community.

## Predicting drug-metagenome interactions: Variation in the microbial β-glucuronidase level in the human gut metagenomes.
 07.01.2021, _MM Elmassry, S Kim, B Busby_


Characterizing the gut microbiota in terms of their capacity to interfere with drug metabolism is necessary to achieve drug efficacy and safety. Although examples of drug-microbiome interactions are well-documented, little has been reported about a computational pipeline for systematically identifying and characterizing bacterial enzymes that process particular classes of drugs. The goal of our study is to develop a computational approach that compiles drugs whose metabolism may be influenced by a particular class of microbial enzymes and that quantifies the variability in the collective level of those enzymes among individuals. The present paper describes this approach, with microbial β-glucuronidases as an example, which break down drug-glucuronide conjugates and reactivate the drugs or their metabolites. We identified 100 medications that may be metabolized by β-glucuronidases from the gut microbiome. These medications included morphine, estrogen, ibuprofen, midazolam, and their structural analogues. The analysis of metagenomic data available through the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) showed that the level of β-glucuronidase in the gut metagenomes was higher in males than in females, which provides a potential explanation for the sex-based differences in efficacy and toxicity for several drugs, reported in previous studies. Our analysis also showed that infant gut metagenomes at birth and 12 months of age have higher levels of β-glucuronidase than the metagenomes of their mothers and the implication of this observed variability was discussed in the context of breastfeeding as well as infant hyperbilirubinemia. Overall, despite important limitations discussed in this paper, our analysis provided useful insights on the role of the human gut metagenome in the variability in drug response among individuals. Importantly, this approach exploits drug and metagenome data available in public databases as well as open-source cheminformatics and bioinformatics tools to predict drug-metagenome interactions.

## A novel type of colistin resistance genes selected from random sequence space.
 15.01.2021, _M Knopp, AM Babina, JS Gudmundsdóttir, MV Douglass, MS Trent, DI Andersson_


Antibiotic resistance is a rapidly increasing medical problem that severely limits the success of antibiotic treatments, and the identification of resistance determinants is key for surveillance and control of resistance dissemination. Horizontal transfer is the dominant mechanism for spread of resistance genes between bacteria but little is known about the original emergence of resistance genes. Here, we examined experimentally if random sequences can generate novel antibiotic resistance determinants de novo. By utilizing highly diverse expression libraries encoding random sequences to select for open reading frames that confer resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin in Escherichia coli, six de novo colistin resistance conferring peptides (Dcr) were identified. The peptides act via direct interactions with the sensor kinase PmrB (also termed BasS in E. coli), causing an activation of the PmrAB two-component system (TCS), modification of the lipid A domain of lipopolysaccharide and subsequent colistin resistance. This kinase-activation was extended to other TCS by generation of chimeric sensor kinases. Our results demonstrate that peptides with novel activities mediated via specific peptide-protein interactions in the transmembrane domain of a sensory transducer can be selected de novo, suggesting that the origination of such peptides from non-coding regions is conceivable. In addition, we identified a novel class of resistance determinants for a key antibiotic that is used as a last resort treatment for several significant pathogens. The high-level resistance provided at low expression levels, absence of significant growth defects and the functionality of Dcr peptides across different genera suggest that this class of peptides could potentially evolve as bona fide resistance determinants in natura.

## A framework for identifying the recent origins of mobile antibiotic resistance genes.
 12.01.2021, _S Ebmeyer, E Kristiansson, DGJ Larsson_


Since the introduction of antibiotics as therapeutic agents, many bacterial pathogens have developed resistance to antibiotics. Mobile resistance genes, acquired through horizontal gene transfer, play an important role in this process. Understanding from which bacterial taxa these genes were mobilized, and whether their origin taxa share common traits, is critical for predicting which environments and conditions contribute to the emergence of novel resistance genes. This knowledge may prove valuable for limiting or delaying future transfer of novel resistance genes into pathogens. The literature on the origins of mobile resistance genes is scattered and based on evidence of variable quality. Here, we summarize, amend and scrutinize the evidence for 37 proposed origins of mobile resistance genes. Using state-of-the-art genomic analyses, we supplement and evaluate the evidence based on well-defined criteria. Nineteen percent of reported origins did not fulfill the criteria to confidently assign the respective origin. Of the curated origin taxa, &gt;90% have been associated with infection in humans or domestic animals, some taxa being the origin of several different resistance genes. The clinical emergence of these resistance genes appears to be a consequence of antibiotic selection pressure on taxa that are permanently or transiently associated with the human/domestic animal microbiome.

## Minimal biophysical model of combined antibiotic action.
 07.01.2021, _B Kavčič, G Tkačik, T Bollenbach_


Phenomenological relations such as Ohm's or Fourier's law have a venerable history in physics but are still scarce in biology. This situation restrains predictive theory. Here, we build on bacterial "growth laws," which capture physiological feedback between translation and cell growth, to construct a minimal biophysical model for the combined action of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Our model predicts drug interactions like antagonism or synergy solely from responses to individual drugs. We provide analytical results for limiting cases, which agree well with numerical results. We systematically refine the model by including direct physical interactions of different antibiotics on the ribosome. In a limiting case, our model provides a mechanistic underpinning for recent predictions of higher-order interactions that were derived using entropy maximization. We further refine the model to include the effects of antibiotics that mimic starvation and the presence of resistance genes. We describe the impact of a starvation-mimicking antibiotic on drug interactions analytically and verify it experimentally. Our extended model suggests a change in the type of drug interaction that depends on the strength of resistance, which challenges established rescaling paradigms. We experimentally show that the presence of unregulated resistance genes can lead to altered drug interaction, which agrees with the prediction of the model. While minimal, the model is readily adaptable and opens the door to predicting interactions of second and higher-order in a broad range of biological systems.
