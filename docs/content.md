Chronic pain and depression are conditions that are highly comorbid and present with overlapping clinical presentations and common pathological biological pathways in neuroinflammation, both of which can be reversed by the use of electroacupuncture (EA) and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1), a Ca2+ permeable ion channel that can be activated by inflammation, is reported to be involved in the development of chronic pain and depression. Here, we investigated the role of TRPV1 and its related pathways in the murine models of cold stress-induced nociception and depression. Female C57BL/6 wild type and TRPV1 knockout mice were subjected to intermittent cold-stress (ICS) to initiate depressive-like and chronic pain behaviors, respectively. The Bio-Plex ELISA technique was utilized to analyze inflammatory mediators in mice plasma. The western blot and immunostaining techniques were used to analyze the presence of TRPV1 and related molecules in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus, periaqueductal gray (PAG), and amygdala. The ICS model significantly induced chronic pain (mechanical: 2.55 ± 0.31g; thermal: 8.12 ± 0.87s) and depressive-like behaviors (10.95 ± 0.95% in the center zone; 53.14 ± 4.01% in immobility). The treatment efficacy of EA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were observed in both nociceptive and depression test results. Inflammatory mediators were increased after ICS induction and further reversed by the use of EA, EPA and DHA. A majority of TRPV1 proteins and related molecules were significantly decreased in the mPFC, hippocampus and PAG of mice. This decrease can be reversed by the use of EA, EPA and DHA. In contrast, these molecules were increased in the mice's amygdala, and were attenuated by the use of EA, EPA and DHA. Our findings indicate that these inflammatory mediators can regulate the TRPV1 signaling pathway and initiate new potential therapeutic targets for chronic pain and depression treatment.

## An environment-friendly approach to isolate and purify glucan from spent cells of recombinant Pichia pastoris and the bioactivity characterization of the purified glucan.

While the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris enables the industrial-scale biosynthesis of many recombinant products, large amount of nutrient-rich biomass emerged along this process. Polysaccharides, especially glucans that are abundant in the cell wall of P. pastoris, are yet to be better utilized owing to their various biological activities. However, the isolation and purification of cell wall glucan from P. pastoris has not been reported. In this study, we established an environment-friendly approach, including induced autolysis, hot-water treatment, ultrasonication, isopropanol extraction, and protease treatment, to isolate and purify glucan from the cell wall of P. pastoris. We achieved a purity of 85.3% and a yield of 11.7% for the purified glucan. Proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and ash were efficiently removed during the purification. The activities of the purified glucan were investigated in mice fed with a high-fat diet. The purified glucan decreased the level of total cholesterol and triglycerides by 30.3 and 29.7%, respectively. This result suggested that the cell wall glucan of P. pastoris could be developed to a therapeutic agent for dyslipidemia. Our study proposed an environment-friendly and effective method to isolate and purify the glucan from P. pastoris, providing solid foundation for the high-value utilization of this yeast.

## The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sample the blow microbiome of small cetaceans.

Recent studies describe the use of UAVs in collecting blow samples from large whales to analyze the microbial and viral community in exhaled air. Unfortunately, attempts to collect blow from small cetaceans have not been successful due to their swimming and diving behavior. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study we investigated the application of a specific sampling tool attached to a UAV to analyze the blow from small cetaceans and their respiratory microbiome. Preliminary trials to set up the sampling tool were conducted on a group of 6 bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) under human care, housed at Acquario di Genova, with approximately 1 meter distance between the blowing animal and the tool to obtain suitable samples. The same sampling kit, suspended via a 2 meter rope assembled on a waterproof UAV, flying 3 meters above the animals, was used to sample the blows of 5 wild bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Ambracia (Greece) and a sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy), to investigate whether this experimental assembly also works for large whale sampling. In order to distinguish between blow-associated microbes and seawater microbes, we pooled 5 seawater samples from the same area where blow samples' collection were carried out. The the respiratory microbiota was assessed by using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene via Illumina Amplicon Sequencing. The pooled water samples contained more bacterial taxa than the blow samples of both wild animals and the sequenced dolphin maintained under human care. The composition of the bacterial community differed between the water samples and between the blow samples of wild cetaceans and that under human care, but these differences may have been mediated by different microbial communities between seawater and aquarium water. The sperm whale's respiratory microbiome was more similar to the results obtained from wild bottlenose dolphins. Although the number of samples used in this study was limited and sampling and analyses were impaired by several limitations, the results are rather encouraging, as shown by the evident microbial differences between seawater and blow samples, confirmed also by the meta-analysis carried out comparing our results with those obtained in previous studies. Collecting exhaled air from small cetaceans using drones is a challenging process, both logistically and technically. The success in obtaining samples from small cetacean blow in this study in comparison to previous studies is likely due to the distance the sampling kit is suspended from the drone, which reduced the likelihood that the turbulence of the drone propeller interfered with successfully sampling blow, suggested as a factor leading to poor success in previous studies.

## Helminth-induced and Th2-dependent alterations of the gut microbiota attenuate obesity caused by high fat diet.

Epidemiological and animal studies have indicated an inverse correlation between the rising prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome and exposure to helminths. Whether helminth-induced immune response contributes to microbiota remodeling in obesity remains unknown. The aim of this study is to explore the immune-regulatory role of helminth in the prevention of HFD-induced obesity through remodeling gut microbiome.

## Microbiome and health implications for ethnic minorities after enforced lifestyle changes.

Modern lifestyles increase the risk of chronic diseases, in part by modifying the microbiome, but the health effects of lifestyles enforced on ethnic minorities are understudied1-3. Lifestyle affects the microbiome early in life, when the microbiome is assembled and the immune system is undergoing maturation4-6. Moreover, the influence of lifestyle has been separated from genetic and geographic factors by studies of genetically similar populations and ethnically distinct groups living in the same geographic location7-11. The lifestyle of Irish Travellers, an ethnically distinct subpopulation, changed with legislation in 2002 that effectively ended nomadism and altered their living conditions. Comparative metagenomics of gut microbiomes shows that Irish Travellers retain a microbiota similar to that of non-industrialized societies. Their microbiota is associated with non-dietary factors and is proportionately linked with risk of microbiome-related metabolic disease. Our findings suggest there are microbiome-related public health implications when ethnic minorities are pressured to change lifestyles.

## High-resolution temporal profiling of the human gut microbiome reveals consistent and cascading alterations in response to dietary glycans.

Dietary glycans, widely used as food ingredients and not directly digested by humans, are of intense interest for their beneficial roles in human health through shaping the microbiome. Characterizing the consistency and temporal responses of the gut microbiome to glycans is critical for rationally developing and deploying these compounds as therapeutics.
