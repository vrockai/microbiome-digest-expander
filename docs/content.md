## Using data science for medical decision making case: role of gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis.
 16.10.2020, _J Hasic Telalovic, A Music_


A decade ago, the advancements in the microbiome data sequencing techniques initiated the development of research of the microbiome and its relationship with the host organism. The development of sophisticated bioinformatics and data science tools for the analysis of large amounts of data followed. Since then, the analyzed gut microbiome data, where microbiome is defined as a network of microorganisms inhabiting the human intestinal system, has been associated with several conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome - IBS, colorectal cancer, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, and lately in the study of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases as well. This paper aims to provide an understanding of differences between microbial data of individuals who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and those who were not by exploiting data science techniques on publicly available data.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. To define the HPV-associated microbial community among a high vaccination coverage population, we carried out a cross-sectional study with 345 young Swedish women. The microbial composition and its association with HPV infection, including 27 HPV types, were analyzed. Microbial alpha-diversity was found significantly higher in the HPV-infected group (especially with oncogenic HPV types and multiple HPV types), compared with the HPV negative group. The vaginal microbiota among HPV-infected women was characterized by a larger number of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB), Sneathia, Prevotella, and Megasphaera. In addition, the correlation analysis demonstrated that twice as many women with non-Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiota were infected with oncogenic HPV types, compared with L. crispatus-dominated vaginal microbiota. The data suggest that HPV infection, especially oncogenic HPV types, is strongly associated with a non-Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiota, regardless of age and vaccination status.

## Engineering the Microbiome to Prevent Adverse Events: Challenges and Opportunities.
 13.10.2020, _S Khan, R Hauptman, L Kelly_


In the past decade of microbiome research, we have learned about numerous adverse interactions between the microbiome and medical interventions such as drugs, radiation, and surgery. What if we could alter our microbiomes to prevent these events? In this review, we discuss potential routes to mitigate microbiome adverse events, including applications from the emerging field of microbiome engineering. We highlight cases where the microbiome acts directly on a treatment, such as via differential drug metabolism, and cases where a treatment directly harms the microbiome, such as in radiation therapy. Understanding and preventing microbiome adverse events are a difficult challenge that will require a data-driven approach involving causal statistics, multiomics techniques, and a personalized means of mitigating adverse events. We propose research considerations to encourage productive work in preventing microbiome adverse events, and we highlight the many challenges and opportunities that await. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Volume 61 is January 7, 2021.

## Inulin alleviates adverse metabolic syndrome and regulates intestinal microbiota composition in Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fed with high-carbohydrate diet.
 13.10.2020, _T Wang, N Zhang, XB Yu, F Qiao, LQ Chen, ZY Du, ML Zhang_


High carbohydrate diet could achieve protein sparing effect, but it may cause negative impacts on the growth condition of fish due to their poor utilization ability of carbohydrate. How to reduce the adverse effects caused by high carbohydrate diet is important for the development of aquaculture. In the present study, we aimed to identify whether inulin could attenuate metabolic syndrome caused by high-carbohydrate diet in fish. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (1.19 ± 0.01 g) were supplied with 35% carbohydrate (CON), 45% carbohydrate (HC) and 45% carbohydrate + 5g/kg inulin (HCI) diets for ten weeks. The results showed that addition of inulin improved the survival rate when fish were challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila, indicating inulin had an immunostimulatory effect. Compared with HC group, HCI group had lower lipid accumulation in liver and the gene expression analyses indicated that addition of inulin downregulated genes related to lipogenesis and upregulated genes relevant to β-oxidation significantly (P &lt; 0.05). Higher liver glycogen and glucose tolerance were found in HCI group compared with HC group (P &lt; 0.05). These results indicated that inulin could alleviate the metabolic syndrome induced by high-carbohydrate diet. Furthermore, addition of inulin in high-carbohydrate diet changed the intestinal bacterial composition and significantly increased the concentration of acetic acid and propionic acid in fish gut which have the potential to increase pathogen resistance and regulate metabolic characteristics in fish. Collectively, our results demonstrated a possible causal role for the gut microbiome in metabolic improvements induced by inulin in fish.

## Transmission of the sponge microbiome: moving towards a unified model.
 13.10.2020, _BFR de Oliveira, J Freitas-Silva, C Sanchez-Robinet, MS Laport_


Sponges have co-evolved for billions of years alongside several types of microorganisms, which aside from participating in the animal's diet, are mostly symbionts. Since most of the genetic repertoire in the holobiont genome is provided by microbes, it is expected that the host-associated microbiome will be at least partially heritable. Sponges can therefore acquire their symbionts in different ways. Both vertical transmission (VT) and horizontal transmission (HT) have different advantages and disadvantages in the life cycle of these invertebrates. However, a third mode of transmission, called leaky vertical transmission or mixed mode of transmission (MMT), which incorporates both VT and HT modes, has gained relevance and seems to be the most robust model. In that regard, the aim of this review is to present the evolving knowledge on these main modes of transmission of the sponge microbiome. Our conclusions lead us to suggest that MMT may be more common for all sponges, with its frequency varying across the transmission spectrum between species and the environment. This hybrid model supports the stable and specific transmission of these microbial partners and reinforces their assistance in the resilience of sponges over the years.

## Co-selection of antibiotic resistance genes, and mobile genetic elements in the presence of heavy metals in poultry farm environments.
 15.10.2020, _SH Mazhar, X Li, A Rashid, J Su, J Xu, AD Brejnrod, JQ Su, Y Wu, YG Zhu, SG Zhou, R Feng, C Rensing_


Environmental selection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is considered to be caused by antibiotic or metal residues, frequently used in livestock. In this study we examined three commercial poultry farms to correlate the co-occurrence patterns of antibiotic and metal residues to the presence of ARGs. We quantified 283 ARGs, 12 mobile genetic elements (MGEs), 49 targeted antibiotics, 7 heavy metals and sequenced 16S rRNA genes. The abundance and type of ARG were significantly enriched in manure while soil harbored the most diverse bacterial community. Procrustes analysis displayed significant correlations between ARGs/MGEs and the microbiome. Cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) were responsible for a majority of positive correlations to ARGs when compared to antibiotics. Integrons and transposons co-occurred with ARGs corresponding to 9 classes of antibiotics, especially Class1 integrase intI-1LC. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that antibiotics, metals, MGEs and bacteria explain solely 0.7%, 5.7%, 12.4%, and 21.9% of variances of ARGs in the microbial community, respectively. These results suggested that bacterial composition and horizontal gene transfer were the major factors shaping the composition of ARGs; Metals had a bigger effect on ARG profile than detected antibiotics in this study.

## Towards meaningful scales in ecosystem microbiome research.
 13.10.2020, _F Dini-Andreote, GA Kowalchuk, JI Prosser, JM Raaijmakers_


Studies of microbial communities in natural ecosystems have been generally focused on mapping patterns of species and gene distributions. Although highly instrumental in expanding our understanding of microbial diversity and distribution patterns, such census studies often lack a meaningful and explicit definition of scale. Here, we discuss the importance of scale in environmental microbiology assessments and consider how patterning ecology can be redirected towards advancing concept and theory formation in ecosystem microbiome research.
