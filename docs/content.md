## Colonic Transendoscopic Enteral Tubing Is a New Pathway to Microbial Therapy, Colonic Drainage, and Host-Microbiota Interaction Research.
 14.02.2023, _W Wang, G Lu, X Wu, Q Wen, F Zhang_


The limitation of traditional delivery methods for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) gave birth to colonic transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET) to address the requirement of frequent FMTs. Colonic TET as a novel endoscopic intervention has received increasing attention in practice since 2015 in China. Emerging studies from multiple centers indicate that colonic TET is a promising, safe, and practical delivery method for microbial therapy and administering medication with high patient satisfaction. Intriguingly, colonic TET has been used to rescue endoscopy-related perforations by draining colonic air and fluid through the TET tube. Recent research based on collecting ileocecal samples through a TET tube has contributed to demonstrating community dynamics in the intestine, and it is expected to be a novel delivery of proof-of-concept in host-microbiota interactions and pharmacological research. The present article aims to review the concept and techniques of TET and to explore microbial therapy, colonic drainage, and microbial research based on colonic TET.

## GTDB-Tk v2: memory friendly classification with the genome taxonomy database.
 23.12.2022, _PA Chaumeil, AJ Mussig, P Hugenholtz, DH Parks_


_Documentation, Software_
The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) and associated taxonomic classification toolkit (GTDB-Tk) have been widely adopted by the microbiology community. However, the growing size of the GTDB bacterial reference tree has resulted in GTDB-Tk requiring substantial amounts of memory (∼320 GB) which limits its adoption and ease of use. Here, we present an update to GTDB-Tk that uses a divide-and-conquer approach where user genomes are initially placed into a bacterial reference tree with family-level representatives followed by placement into an appropriate class-level subtree comprising species representatives. This substantially reduces the memory requirements of GTDB-Tk while having minimal impact on classification.

## Comparison of pregnancy outcomes of letrozole-induced frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles in PCOS women with two different abnormal ovulation patterns: A retrospective cohort study.
 17.02.2023, _DD Wang, JX Cao, WJ Jiang, JW Hou, MH Yan, ZG Sun, JY Song_


No studies have been conducted on the impact of different types of ovulatory dysfunction on the outcomes of frozen-thawed embryo transfers (FETs) in a letrozole-stimulated cycle in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). This study aimed to compare whether pregnancy outcomes of the letrozole-induced protocol in FET cycles differed between oligo-ovulatory and anovulatory women with PCOS. In a retrospective cohort study, women with PCOS who had undergone letrozole-induced FET at a university-affiliated fertility clinic from February 2014 to October 2020 were identified. The primary end point was live birth rate (LBR) per embryo transfer. Propensity score matching and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to control for the relevant confounders. A total of 652 women with PCOS undergoing letrozole-induced FET were included in the final analysis. Three hundred sixty-three of these women had oligo-ovulatory periods, while 289 had anovulatory periods. Propensity score matching analysis showed that LBR did not differ between groups (36.8% in oligo-ovulatory group vs 32.8% in anovulatory group, P = .431). Nevertheless, after controlling for potential confounding factors, LBR was significantly lower in anovulatory than oligo-ovulatory women (adjusted odds ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.29, P = .018). Furthermore, the pregnancy loss rate among the oligo-ovulatory group remained lower than those among the anovulatory group (adjusted odds ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.44, P &lt; .001). Despite adjustment for confounding factors, those with oligo-ovulatory PCOS had a higher LBR and lower pregnancy loss rate compared with those with anovulatory PCOS. This may indicate that when oligo-ovulation is detected, PCOS patients should be intervened in time to conceive as soon as possible. Prospective studies must be conducted in the future to verify our findings.

## Prepregnancy Obesity and Breastfeeding in the First Month of Life: A Birth Cohort.
 17.02.2023, _TBA Cortes, DDS Rocha, VM Bezerra, M Pereira Netto_


Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association between prepregnancy obesity and disruption of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) within the first month of life. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective cohort study conducted among Brazilian mothers and their babies born between February and December 2017. Research was conducted in all maternity hospitals in Vitória da Conquista, Brazil. Data collection started in the maternity hospitals of the city and, subsequently, an interview was conducted during a home visit on the 30th day of the child's life. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and a log rank test was applied to compare the curves. The association between independent variables and the response variable was assessed using Cox regression, following the conceptual model created for the study. Results: The study analyzed 329 pairs of mothers and babies. The prevalence of prepregnancy obesity was 12%. The prevalence of EBF disruption in the first month of life was 41.1% in nonobese mothers (confidence interval [95% CI]: 35.3-46.9) and 52.6% in obese mothers (95% CI: 36.3-68.4), with a shorter survival time among mothers with prepregnancy obesity (log rank p &lt; 0.05). The risk of EBF disruption in the first month of life was 83% higher among mothers with prepregnancy obesity, after adjusting for confounding variables-demographic, socioeconomic, prenatal maternal data, and childbirth variables (hazard ratio = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.08-3.11). Conclusions: We observed an association between pregestational obesity and disruption of EBF in the first month of life. This finding reinforces the need for a thorough professional approach to the practice of breastfeeding in this population in the prenatal period as well as early puerperium.

## The Impact of Non-Pathogenic Bacteria on the Spread of Virulence and Resistance Genes.
 14.02.2023, _F Dionisio, CPF Domingues, JS Rebelo, F Monteiro, T Nogueira_


_Humans, Virulence, Bacteria, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Microbiota_
This review discusses the fate of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes frequently present among microbiomes. A central concept in epidemiology is the mean number of hosts colonized by one infected host in a population of susceptible hosts: R0. It characterizes the disease's epidemic potential because the pathogen continues its propagation through susceptible hosts if it is above one. R0 is proportional to the average duration of infections, but non-pathogenic microorganisms do not cause host death, and hosts do not need to be rid of them. Therefore, commensal bacteria may colonize hosts for prolonged periods, including those harboring drug resistance or even a few virulence genes. Thus, their R0 is likely to be (much) greater than one, with peculiar consequences for the spread of virulence and resistance genes. For example, computer models that simulate the spread of these genes have shown that their diversities should correlate positively throughout microbiomes. Bioinformatics analysis with real data corroborates this expectation. Those simulations also anticipate that, contrary to the common wisdom, human's microbiomes with a higher diversity of both gene types are the ones that took antibiotics longer ago rather than recently. Here, we discuss the mechanisms and robustness behind these predictions and other public health consequences.

## Identifying glycan consumers in human gut microbiota samples using metabolic labeling coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

The composition and metabolism of the human gut microbiota are strongly influenced by dietary complex glycans, which cause downstream effects on the physiology and health of hosts. Despite recent advances in our understanding of glycan metabolism by human gut bacteria, we still need methods to link glycans to their consuming bacteria. Here, we use a functional assay to identify and isolate gut bacteria from healthy human volunteers that take up different glycans. The method combines metabolic labeling using fluorescent oligosaccharides with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), followed by amplicon sequencing or culturomics. Our results demonstrate metabolic labeling in various taxa, such as Prevotella copri, Collinsella aerofaciens and Blautia wexlerae. In vitro validation confirms the ability of most, but not all, labeled species to consume the glycan of interest for growth. In parallel, we show that glycan consumers spanning three major phyla can be isolated from cultures of sorted labeled cells. By linking bacteria to the glycans they consume, this approach increases our basic understanding of glycan metabolism by gut bacteria. Going forward, it could be used to provide insight into the mechanism of prebiotic approaches, where glycans are used to manipulate the gut microbiota composition.

## Disturbance of lipid metabolism in germ-free mice transplanted with gut microbiota of DSS-induced colitis mice.

Hepatobiliary abnormality and metabolic disorders are frequently observed complications in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Given that microbiota dysbiosis is a common pathophysiological feature of both IBD and metabolic diseases, we examined how the IBD-induced dysbiosis affects the host metabolism and contributes to the development of associated metabolic diseases using germ-free (GF) mice transplanted with fecal microbiota of DSS-induced colitis mice. There was no significant change in inflammation or barrier integrity in the gut of GF mice that received microbiota from colitis mice compared to their counterparts that were transplanted with microbiota from non-colitis healthy mice. Interestingly, it was observed that the GF recipients of colitis-induced altered microbiota showed a significant decrease in the weight of adipose tissues including mesenteric, epididymal, subcutaneous, and brown fat without any change in body weight, which was accompanied by abnormalities in adipose tissue functions such as fat storage and adiponectin production. Transplantation of colitis-induced altered microbiota also disrupted hepatic lipid metabolism in the GF recipient mice, which was observed by increases in synthesis and accumulation of cholesterol and bile acids in hepatocytes and a decrease in plasma HDL-cholesterol. Additional observations including elevated plasma levels of insulin, decreased hepatic production of FGF21, and decreased levels of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and hepatic expression of SCFA receptors led to a conclusion that the transplantation of the colitis-associated dysbiotic microbiota was causally associated with impairments of insulin action and FGF21-adiponectin axis, possibly due to the low SCFA-producing capacity of the colonized microbiota, leading to metabolic abnormalities including adipose tissue dysfunction and dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism. Our findings suggest potential mechanisms that explain how colitis-associated gut dysbiosis may contribute to the development of metabolic dysfunctions, which could be applied to clinical practice to improve the efficacy of treatment of IBD patients with comorbid metabolic disorders or vice versa.

## uBin - a manual refining tool for genomes from metagenomes.
 10.02.2023, _TLV Bornemann, SP Esser, TL Stach, T Burg, AJ Probst_


Resolving bacterial and archaeal genomes from metagenomes has revolutionized our understanding of Earth's biomes yet producing high quality genomes from assembled fragments has been an ever-standing problem. While automated binning software and their combination produce prokaryotic bins in high throughput, their manual refinement has been slow, sometimes difficult or missing entirely facilitating error propagation in public databases. Here, we present uBin, a GUI-based, standalone bin refiner that runs on all major operating platforms and was additionally designed for educational purposes. When applied to the public CAMI dataset, refinement of bins using GC content, coverage and taxonomy was able to improve 78.9% of bins by decreasing their contamination. We also applied the bin refiner as a standalone binner to public metagenomes from the International Space Station and demonstrate the recovery of near-complete genomes, whose replication indices indicate active proliferation of microbes in Earth's lower orbit. uBin is an easy to install software for bin refinement, binning of simple metagenomes and communication of metagenomic results to other scientists and in classrooms. The software and its helper scripts are open source and available under https://github.com/ProbstLab/uBin. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

## The virtual microbiome: A computational framework to evaluate microbiome analyses.
 10.02.2023, _B Serrano-Antón, F Rodríguez-Ventura, P Colomer-Vidal, RA Cigliano, CF Arias, F Bertocchini_


_Animals, Reproducibility of Results, Microbiota, Bacteria, Larva, Moths_
Microbiomes have been the focus of a substantial research effort in the last decades. The composition of microbial populations is normally determined by comparing DNA sequences sampled from those populations with the sequences stored in genomic databases. Therefore, the amount of information available in databanks should be expected to constrain the accuracy of microbiome analyses. Albeit normally ignored in microbiome studies, this constraint could severely compromise the reliability of microbiome data. To test this hypothesis, we generated virtual bacterial populations that exhibit the ecological structure of real-world microbiomes. Confronting the analyses of virtual microbiomes with their original composition revealed critical issues in the current approach to characterizing microbiomes, issues that were empirically confirmed by analyzing the microbiome of Galleria mellonella larvae. To reduce the uncertainty of microbiome data, the effort in the field must be channeled towards significantly increasing the amount of available genomic information and optimizing the use of this information.
