In the absence of an effective vaccine or curative treatment for HIV, the global HIV/AIDS epidemic continues despite significant advances in treatment and prevention. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs have transformed HIV from a terminal illness to a manageable chronic condition. Likewise, pre-exposure prophylaxis treatment (PrEP) has dramatically reduced transmission in some of the highest risk populations. However, quality of life and life expectancy in people living with HIV (PWH) still lag significantly behind the general population. The mechanisms that reduce the efficacy of PrEP and ART are multifaceted, but one factor that warrants additional attention is the impact of the microbiome on ART and PrEP efficacy, as well as pharmacokinetics more broadly. In this review, we assess the current state of research on the HIV-associated microbiome, how this impacts treatment efficacy, and how microbiome states can alter HIV susceptibility. We also explore how the mechanisms we propose could extend to the efficacy of other drugs and identify promising areas of research that remain understudied. Video Abstract.

## A systematic review of the relationship between gut microbiota and prevalence of pancreatic diseases.
 10.12.2024, _WM Jankowski, J Fichna, A Tarasiuk-Zawadzka_


Acute pancreatitis (AP) represents one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) diseases; it can manifest in varying degrees of severity, sometimes leading to a life-threatening condition for the patient. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), due to its high malignancy and uncertain prognosis, is widely regarded as one of the most fatal diseases. The increasing prevalence of AP and PDAC represents a major burden on public health and the healthcare system worldwide. The aim of this systematic review was to discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the relationship between the gut microbiota and the incidence, prognosis, diagnosis and treatment of AP and PDAC. To identify studies that analyzed the relationship between the gut microbiota and the occurrence/development of pancreatic diseases or PDAC, the online databases PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched between November 2023 and January 2024. Finally, 14 publications met the inclusion criteria (1. were conducted exclusively in humans and/or animals; 2. original, published in English in peer-reviewed journals after 2019; 3. described the relationship between gut microbiota and the occurrence of AP or PDAC). The collected studies indicated significant changes in the gut microbiota of patients with AP and PDAC. Moreover, they highlighted the presence of a relationship between the gut microbiota and the occurrence, course, treatment efficiency and prognosis of the disease in question. Further research is needed to understand precisely the relationship between the gut microbiota and the occurrence of pancreatic diseases and whether it may be a starting point for the development of modern forms of therapy based on the use of prebiotics and/or diet to restore the normal composition of the intestinal bacteria.

## Beneficial microbiome and diet interplay in early-onset colorectal cancer.
 09.12.2024, _Z Zhou, L Kleis, A Depetris-Chauvin, S Jaskulski, V Damerell, KB Michels, B Gigic, U NÃ¶thlings, G Panagiotou_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although the risk of developing CRC increases with age, approximately 10% of newly diagnosed cases occur in individuals under the age of 50. Significant changes in dietary habits in young adults since industrialization create a favorable microenvironment for colorectal carcinogenesis. We aim here to shed light on the complex interplay between diet and gut microbiome in the pathogenesis and prevention of early-onset CRC (EO-CRC). We provide an overview of dietary risk factors associated with EO-CRC and contrast them with the general trends for CRC. We delve into gut bacteria, fungi, and phages with potential benefits against CRC and discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, based on recent findings from human studies, we offer insights into how dietary modifications could potentially enhance gut microbiome composition to mitigate CRC risk. All together, we outline the current research landscape in this area and propose directions for future investigations that could pave the way for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), a persistent organic pollutant, poses significant ecological risks. This study investigates the effects of PFOS on rhizosphere microbial communities of two wetland plants, Lythrum salicaria (LS) and Phragmites communis (PC). We conducted microcosm experiments to analyze the physiological status of soil microbes under varying PFOS concentrations and examined the role of root exudates in modulating PFOS mobility. Flow cytometry and soil respiration measurements revealed that PFOS exposure increased microbial mortality, with differential impacts observed between LS and PC rhizospheres. LS root exudates intensified microbial stress, whereas PC exudates mitigated PFOS toxicity. Thin-layer chromatography indicated that LS exudates decreased PFOS mobility, leading to higher local concentrations and increased microbial toxicity, while PC exudates enhanced PFOS mobility, reducing its local impact. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy of root exudates identified compositional shifts under PFOS stress, highlighting distinct defense strategies in LS and PC. These findings underscore the importance of plant-microbe interactions and root exudate composition in determining microbial resilience to PFOS contamination.

The burgeoning crises of antimicrobial resistance and plastic pollution are converging in healthcare settings, presenting a complex challenge to global health. This study investigates the microbial populations in healthcare waste to understand the extent of antimicrobial resistance and the potential for plastic degradation by bacteria. Our metagenomic analysis, using both amplicon and shallow shotgun sequencing, provided a comprehensive view of the taxonomic diversity and functional capacity of the microbial consortia. The viable bacteria in healthcare waste samples were analyzed employing full-length 16S rRNA sequencing, revealing a diverse bacterial community dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla. Notably, Proteus mirabilis VFC3/3 and Pseudomonas sp. VFA2/3 were detected, while Stenotrophomonas maltophilia VFV3/2 surfaced as the predominant species, holding implications for the spread of hospital-acquired infections and antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility testing identified multidrug-resistant strains conferring antimicrobial genes, including the broad-spectrum antibiotic carbapenem, underscoring the critical need for improved waste management and infection control measures. Remarkably, we found genes linked to the breakdown of plastic that encoded for enzymes of the esterase, depolymerase, and oxidoreductase classes. This suggests that specific bacteria found in medical waste may be able to reduce the amount of plastic pollution that comes from biological and medical waste. The information is helpful in formulating strategies to counter the combined problems of environmental pollution and antibiotic resistance. This study emphasises the importance of monitoring microbial communities in hospital waste in order to influence waste management procedures and public health policy. The findings highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to mitigate the risks associated with antimicrobial resistance and plastic waste, especially in hospital settings where they intersect most acutely.

## Development and evaluation of pH-sensitive Euryale ferox starch-based films containing nano-SiO2 and Chinese rose (Rosa chinensis) extract for freshness monitoring of chicken breast meat.
 28.12.2024, _Y Zou, S Wang, T Liu, Q Zhang, Y Zhang, C Jiang_


In this study, smart films of EFS, EFS-SiO2 and EFS-SiO2-CRE were successfully developed by using Euryale ferox starch (EFS), nano-SiO2 and Chinese rose extract (CRE). The Chinese rose flower had a high content of anthocyanins (1.73 mg/g) and CRE exhibited different colors in varying pH buffers (2-13). The addition of nano-SiO2 decreased tensile strength (TS) (41.08 to 16.75 MPa) and elongation at break (EAB) (6.71 to 2.69 %) of the EFS film. Incorporation with CRE could significantly increase water vapor permeability (4.47 to 5.35 10-11 g m-1 s-1 Pa-1), TS (16.75 to 26.19 MPa) and EAB (2.69 to 4.62 %) of the EFS-SiO2 film. Incorporation of nano-SiO2 and CRE significantly enhanced the thermal stability and light barrier performance of the EFS film. The EFS-SiO2-CRE films showed excellent pH and ammonia sensitivities with different colors varying from red to blue. The EFS-SiO2-CRE-III film displayed strong antioxidant activity with a maximum DPPH scavenging rate of 96.54 Â± 0.44 %. When employed for monitoring freshness of chicken breast meat, the EFS-SiO2-CRE-III film showed the most significant visible color changes at 24 h when the TVB-N content was 21.7 mg/100 g. Findings supported the application of this strategy in fabrication of the EFS-SiO2-CRE-III film for smart packaging.

## MCSPACE: inferring microbiome spatiotemporal dynamics from high-throughput co-localization data.
 04.01.2025, _G Uppal, GK Urtecho, M Richardson, IY Comba, J Lee, T Moody, HH Wang, GK Gerber_


Recent advances in high-throughput approaches for estimating co-localization of microbes, such as SAMPL-seq, allow characterization of the biogeography of the gut microbiome longitudinally and at unprecedented scale. However, these high-dimensional data are complex and have unique noise properties. To address these challenges, we developed MCSPACE, a probabilistic AI method that infers from microbiome co-localization data spatially coherent assemblages of taxa, their dynamics over time, and their responses to perturbations. To evaluate MCSPACE's capabilities, we generated the largest longitudinal microbiome co-localization dataset to date, profiling spatial relationships of microbes in the guts of mice subjected to serial dietary perturbations over 76 days. Analyses of these data and an existing human longitudinal dataset demonstrated superior benchmarking performance of MCSPACE over existing methods, and moreover yielded insights into spatiotemporal structuring of the gut microbiome, including identifying temporally persistent and dynamic microbial assemblages in the human gut, and shifts in assemblages in the murine gut induced by specific dietary components. Our results highlight the utility of our method, which we make available to the community as an open-source software tool, for elucidating dynamics of microbiome biogeography and gaining insights into the role of spatial relationships in host-microbial ecosystem function.
