## Multi-dimensional experimental and computational exploration of metabolism pinpoints complex probiotic interactions.
 31.01.2023, _G Zampieri, G Efthimiou, C Angione_


Multi-strain probiotics are widely regarded as effective products for improving gut microbiota stability and host health, providing advantages over single-strain probiotics. However, in general, it is unclear to what extent different strains would cooperate or compete for resources, and how the establishment of a common biofilm microenvironment could influence their interactions. In this work, we develop an integrative experimental and computational approach to comprehensively assess the metabolic functionality and interactions of probiotics across growth conditions. Our approach combines co-culture assays with genome-scale modelling of metabolism and multivariate data analysis, thus exploiting complementary data- and knowledge-driven systems biology techniques. To show the advantages of the proposed approach, we apply it to the study of the interactions between two widely used probiotic strains of Lactobacillus reuteri and Saccharomyces boulardii, characterising their production potential for compounds that can be beneficial to human health. Our results show that these strains can establish a mixed cooperative-antagonistic interaction best explained by competition for shared resources, with an increased individual exchange but an often decreased net production of amino acids and short-chain fatty acids. Overall, our work provides a strategy that can be used to explore microbial metabolic fingerprints of biotechnological interest, capable of capturing multifaceted equilibria even in simple microbial consortia.

## Advancing CAR T cell therapy through the use of multidimensional omics data.
 01.02.2023, _J Yang, Y Chen, Y Jing, MR Green, L Han_


Despite the notable success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies in the treatment of certain haematological malignancies, challenges remain in optimizing CAR designs and cell products, improving response rates, extending the durability of remissions, reducing toxicity and broadening the utility of this therapeutic modality to other cancer types. Data from multidimensional omics analyses, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, T cell receptor-repertoire profiling, proteomics, metabolomics and/or microbiomics, provide unique opportunities to dissect the complex and dynamic multifactorial phenotypes, processes and responses of CAR T cells as well as to discover novel tumour targets and pathways of resistance. In this Review, we summarize the multidimensional cellular and molecular profiling technologies that have been used to advance our mechanistic understanding of CAR T cell therapies. In addition, we discuss current applications and potential strategies leveraging multi-omics data to identify optimal target antigens and other molecular features that could be exploited to enhance the antitumour activity and minimize the toxicity of CAR T cell therapy. Indeed, fully utilizing multi-omics data will provide new insights into the biology of CAR T cell therapy, further accelerate the development of products with improved efficacy and safety profiles, and enable clinicians to better predict and monitor patient responses.

## Microbial transmission, colonisation and succession: from pregnancy to infancy.
 31.01.2023, _L Xiao, F Zhao_


The microbiome has been proven to be associated with many diseases and has been used as a biomarker and target in disease prevention and intervention. Currently, the vital role of the microbiome in pregnant women and newborns is increasingly emphasised. In this review, we discuss the interplay of the microbiome and the corresponding immune mechanism between mothers and their offspring during the perinatal period. We aim to present a comprehensive picture of microbial transmission and potential immune imprinting before and after delivery. In addition, we discuss the possibility of in utero microbial colonisation during pregnancy, which has been highly debated in recent studies, and highlight the importance of the microbiome in infant development during the first 3 years of life. This holistic view of the role of the microbial interplay between mothers and infants will refine our current understanding of pregnancy complications as well as diseases in early life and will greatly facilitate the microbiome-based prenatal diagnosis and treatment of mother-infant-related diseases.

## Changes in the Gut Microbiome Associated with Intussusception in Patients with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome.
 31.01.2023, _Z Wang, L Liang, L Liu, Z Wang, Y Wang, Z Yu, B Wu, Y Chen_


Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by intestinal polyposis, and intestinal intussusception is one of the most urgent complications. While it is known that imbalance of the gut microbiota is highly associated with intestinal disorders, the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of PJS has not been reported. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing on stools from 168 patients and 68 healthy family members who lived together to determine the gut microbiome composition of PJS patients. Metagenomics sequencing was further performed on the representative samples (61 PJS patients and 27 healthy family members) to analyze the functional changes. We found that the fecal microbiome of patients with PJS showed a greater variation in β-diversity. An enhancement of Escherichia coli and a reduction of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was identified in PJS patients. Further reduction of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was the characteristic microbial change observed in patients with intussusception. Functional analysis revealed that the abundance of propanoate metabolism was enriched in PJS patients and further enriched in those with intussusception. Escherichia coli was the major contributor to the enrichment of this metabolism pathway, which was associated with the abnormal expression of methylglyoxal synthase (encoded by mgsA) and phosphate acetyltransferase (encoded by pta). Our findings showed a distinct gut microbiome signature in PJS patients and identified the connection between the gut microbiome and intussusception. Alterations in the gut microbiome might be involved in the pathogenesis of PJS and may serve as biomarkers for gastrointestinal surveillance. IMPORTANCE Recent research has established a link between the gut microbiome and polyps and neoplasia, and antibiotic use influences the microbiome and the development of colorectal polyps. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which is characterized by the early development of benign precursor lesions (polyps), is associated with enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli biofilms. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and the pathophysiology of PJS has not yet been established. In this study, we found that PJS patients had a distinct microbiome composition, with a greater variation in β-diversity, an increase in Escherichia coli, and a decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. A further reduction of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was observed in patients with intussusception. Moreover, PJS involved increased propanoate metabolism as well as abnormal mgsA and pta expression. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the etiology of PJS and improve disease control strategies.

## Host-microbe co-metabolism via MCAD generates circulating metabolites including hippuric acid.

The human gut microbiota produces dozens of small molecules that circulate in blood, accumulate to comparable levels as pharmaceutical drugs, and influence host physiology. Despite the importance of these metabolites to human health and disease, the origin of most microbially-produced molecules and their fate in the host remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover a host-microbe co-metabolic pathway for generation of hippuric acid, one of the most abundant organic acids in mammalian urine. Combining stable isotope tracing with bacterial and host genetics, we demonstrate reduction of phenylalanine to phenylpropionic acid by gut bacteria; the host re-oxidizes phenylpropionic acid involving medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). Generation of germ-free male and female MCAD-/- mice enabled gnotobiotic colonization combined with untargeted metabolomics to identify additional microbial metabolites processed by MCAD in host circulation. Our findings uncover a host-microbe pathway for the abundant, non-toxic phenylalanine metabolite hippurate and identify β-oxidation via MCAD as a novel mechanism by which mammals metabolize microbiota-derived metabolites.

## Disruption of the Intestinal Mucosal Barrier Induced by High Fructose and Restraint Stress Is Regulated by the Intestinal Microbiota and Microbiota Metabolites.
 31.01.2023, _J Yu, T Liu, Q Guo, Z Wang, Y Chen, Y Dong_


Environmental (restraint stress) and dietary (high fructose) factors are key triggers for flares of inflammatory bowel disease; however, the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are not fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which restraint stress and high fructose damage the intestinal mucosal immune barrier. The feces of C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolome sequencing, and the intestinal histological structure was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. The mRNA and protein levels of the intestinal protein were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The metabolites of the microbiota were tested in vitro, and Akkermansia muciniphila was used for colonization in vivo. Dietary fructose exacerbated the development of restraint stress, with an extensive change in the composition of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites. The disturbance of the microbiota composition led to an increase in the abundance of histamine and a decrease in the abundance of taurine, which inhibited the expression of tight junction and MUC2 proteins, destroyed the function of NLRP6, and reduced intestinal autophagy level; this in turn disrupted the function of colonic goblet cells to secrete mucus, leading to defects in the intestinal mucosal barrier, which ultimately codrives colon autoinflammation. However, A. muciniphila supplementation counteracted damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier by high fructose and restraint stress. Therefore, the gut microbiota and microbiota metabolites play an important role in maintaining microenvironment homeostasis of the intestinal mucosal barrier. IMPORTANCE A high-fructose diet aggravated restraint stress-induced changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiome, in which the abundance of A. muciniphila was significantly increased. The high-fructose diet exacerbated restraint stress-induced the changes in the composition of the microbial metabolites, with taurine abundance being downregulated and histamine abundance upregulated. High fructose and restraint stress induced colonic mucosal immune barrier damage, possibly due to changes in the abundance of the microbial metabolites taurine and histamine. Colonization with A. muciniphila stimulated the expression of the NLRP6 inflammasome and activated autophagy in goblet cells, thereby producing more new mucins, which could protect the intestinal mucosal barrier.

## Viral infection switches the balance between bacterial and eukaryotic recyclers of organic matter during coccolithophore blooms.

Algal blooms are hotspots of marine primary production and play central roles in microbial ecology and global elemental cycling. Upon demise of the bloom, organic carbon is partly respired and partly transferred to either higher trophic levels, bacterial biomass production or sinking. Viral infection can lead to bloom termination, but its impact on the fate of carbon remains largely unquantified. Here, we characterize the interplay between viral infection and the composition of a bloom-associated microbiome and consequently the evolving biogeochemical landscape, by conducting a large-scale mesocosm experiment where we monitor seven induced coccolithophore blooms. The blooms show different degrees of viral infection and reveal that only high levels of viral infection are followed by significant shifts in the composition of free-living bacterial and eukaryotic assemblages. Intriguingly, upon viral infection the biomass of eukaryotic heterotrophs (thraustochytrids) rivals that of bacteria as potential recyclers of organic matter. By combining modeling and quantification of active viral infection at a single-cell resolution, we estimate that viral infection causes a 2-4 fold increase in per-cell rates of extracellular carbon release in the form of acidic polysaccharides and particulate inorganic carbon, two major contributors to carbon sinking into the deep ocean. These results reveal the impact of viral infection on the fate of carbon through microbial recyclers of organic matter in large-scale coccolithophore blooms.

The phytoplankton spring bloom in freshwater habitats is a complex, recurring, and dynamic ecological spectacle that unfolds at multiple biological scales. Although enormous taxonomic shifts in microbial assemblages during and after the bloom have been reported, genomic information on the microbial community of the spring bloom remains scarce.
