Whether the human fetus and the prenatal intrauterine environment (amniotic fluid and placenta) are stably colonized by microbial communities in a healthy pregnancy remains a subject of debate. Here we evaluate recent studies that characterized microbial populations in human fetuses from the perspectives of reproductive biology, microbial ecology, bioinformatics, immunology, clinical microbiology and gnotobiology, and assess possible mechanisms by which the fetus might interact with microorganisms. Our analysis indicates that the detected microbial signals are likely the result of contamination during the clinical procedures to obtain fetal samples or during DNA extraction and DNA sequencing. Furthermore, the existence of live and replicating microbial populations in healthy fetal tissues is not compatible with fundamental concepts of immunology, clinical microbiology and the derivation of germ-free mammals. These conclusions are important to our understanding of human immune development and illustrate common pitfalls in the microbial analyses of many other low-biomass environments. The pursuit of a fetal microbiome serves as a cautionary example of the challenges of sequence-based microbiome studies when biomass is low or absent, and emphasizes the need for a trans-disciplinary approach that goes beyond contamination controls by also incorporating biological, ecological and mechanistic concepts.

## Microbial foods for improving human and planetary health.
 19.01.2023, _LJ Jahn, VM Rekdal, MOA Sommer_


The current food production system is negatively impacting planetary and human health. A transition to a sustainable and fair food system is urgently needed. Microorganisms are likely enablers of this process, as they can produce delicious and healthy microbial foods with low environmental footprints. We review traditional and current approaches to microbial foods, such as fermented foods, microbial biomass, and food ingredients derived from microbial fermentations. We discuss how future advances in science-driven fermentation, synthetic biology, and sustainable feedstocks enable a new generation of microbial foods, potentially impacting the sustainability, resilience, and health effects of our food system.

## Associations of the skin, oral and gut microbiome with aging, frailty and infection risk reservoirs in older adults.

Older adults represent a vulnerable population with elevated risk for numerous morbidities. To explore the association of the microbiome with aging and age-related susceptibilities including frailty and infectious disease risk, we conducted a longitudinal study of the skin, oral, and gut microbiota in 47 community- or skilled nursing facility-dwelling older adults vs. younger adults. We found that microbiome changes were not associated with chronological age so much as frailty: we identified prominent changes in microbiome features associated with susceptibility to pathogen colonization and disease risk, including diversity, stability, heterogeneity, and biogeographic determinism, which were moreover associated with a loss of Cutibacterium (C.) acnes in the skin microbiome. Strikingly, the skin microbiota were also the primary reservoir for antimicrobial resistance, clinically important pathobionts, and nosocomial strains, suggesting a potential role particularly for the skin microbiome in disease risk and dissemination of multidrug resistant pathogens.

## Phage therapy: From biological mechanisms to future directions.
 11.01.2023, _SA Strathdee, GF Hatfull, VK Mutalik, RT Schooley_


_Phage Therapy, Bacteriophages, Bacteria_
Increasing antimicrobial resistance rates have revitalized bacteriophage (phage) research, the natural predators of bacteria discovered over 100 years ago. In order to use phages therapeutically, they should (1) preferably be lytic, (2) kill the bacterial host efficiently, and (3) be fully characterized to exclude side effects. Developing therapeutic phages takes a coordinated effort of multiple stakeholders. Herein, we review the state of the art in phage therapy, covering biological mechanisms, clinical applications, remaining challenges, and future directions involving naturally occurring and genetically modified or synthetic phages.
