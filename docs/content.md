## Trout-like multifunctional piezoelectric robotic fish and energy harvester.
 13.05.2021, _D Tan, YC Wang, E Kohtanen, A Erturk_


This work presents our experimental studies on a trout-inspired multifunctional robotic fish as an underwater swimmer and energy harvester. Fiber-based flexible piezoelectric composites with interdigitated electrodes, specifically Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) structures, strike a balance between the deformation and actuation force capabilities to generate hydrodynamic propulsion without requiring additional mechanisms for motion amplification. A pair of MFC laminates bracketing a passive fin functions like artificial muscle when driven out of phase to expand and contract on each side to create bending. The trout-like robotic fish design explored in this work was tested for both unconstrained swimming in a quiescent water tank and under imposed flow in a water tunnel to estimate the maximum swimming speed, which exceeded 0.25 m/s, i.e., 0.8 body length per second. Hydrodynamic thrust characterization was also performed in a quiescent water setting, and it was found that the fin can easily produce tens of mN thrust, similar to its biological counterpart for similar swimming speeds. Overall, the prototype presented here generates thrust levels higher than other smart material-based concepts (such as soft polymeric material-based actuators which provide large deformation but low force), while offering simple design, geometric scalability, and silent operation unlike motor-based robotic fish (which use bulky actuators and complex mechanisms). Additionally, energy harvesting experiments were performed to convert flow-induced vibrations at the wake of a cylindrical bluff body (for different diameters) in a water tunnel. The shed vortex frequency range for a set of bluff body diameters covered the first vibration mode of the tail, yielding an average electrical power of 120 μW at resonance for a flow speed around 0.3 m/s and a bluff body diameter of 28.6 mm. Such low-power electricity can find applications to power small sensors of the robotic fish in scenarios such as ecological monitoring, among others.

## Improving Medical and Nurse Practitioner Student Confidence and Clinical Skill in Advance Care Plan Development: A Multidisciplinary Mentorship Model.
 13.05.2021, _AC Coogan, MM Shifrin, MT Williams, J Alverio, VJ Periyakoil, MB Karlekar_


Advance care planning (ACP) is an integral aspect of patient-centered care, however medical (MD) and Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (AGACNP) students receive minimal education on how to facilitate ACP discussions and ultimately feel uncomfortable having these discussions with patients.1-4 The aim of this project was to increase MD and AGACNP students' perceived ability and confidence in leading ACP conversations through an ACP educational program called the Letter Project Pilot (LPP).

## Long-read metagenomics retrieves complete single-contig bacterial genomes from canine feces.

Long-read sequencing in metagenomics facilitates the assembly of complete genomes out of complex microbial communities. These genomes include essential biologic information such as the ribosomal genes or the mobile genetic elements, which are usually missed with short-reads. We applied long-read metagenomics with Nanopore sequencing to retrieve high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (HQ MAGs) from a dog fecal sample.

## Perinatal exposure to tetracycline contributes to lasting developmental effects on offspring.
 14.05.2021, _EM Hill, CD Howard, TL Bale, E Jašarević_


For more than 30 years, the tetracycline on/off system of inducible gene expression has been leveraged to study disease mechanisms across many research areas, especially that of metabolism and neuroscience. This system requires acute or chronic exposure to tetracycline derivatives, such as doxycycline, to manipulate gene expression in a temporal and tissue-specific manner, with exposure often being restricted to gestational and early developmental windows. Despite evidence showing that early life antibiotic exposure has adverse effects on gut microbiota, metabolism, physiology, immunity and behavior, little is known regarding the lasting impact of doxycycline treatment on relevant outcomes in experimental offspring.
