DNA transfer is ubiquitous in the human gut microbiota, especially among species of the order Bacteroidales. In silico analyses have revealed hundreds of mobile genetic elements shared between these species, yet little is known about the phenotypes they encode, their effects on fitness, or pleiotropic consequences for the recipient's genome. In this work, we show that acquisition of a ubiquitous integrative conjugative element (ICE) encoding a type VI secretion system (T6SS) shuts down the native T6SS of Bacteroides fragilis. Despite inactivating this T6SS, ICE acquisition increases the fitness of the B. fragilis transconjugant over its progenitor by arming it with the new T6SS. DNA transfer causes the strain to change allegiances so that it no longer targets ecosystem members with the same element yet is armed for communal defense.

## Exploring alterations of gut/blood microbes in addressing iron overload-induced gut dysbiosis and cognitive impairment in thalassemia patients.

Iron overload causes cognitive impairment in thalassemia patients. The gut-brain axis plays an important role in cognitive function. However, the association between gut/blood microbiome, cognition, and iron burden in thalassemia patients has not been thoroughly investigated. We aimed to determine those associations in thalassemia patients with different blood-transfusion regimens. Sixty participants: healthy controls, transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients, and non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT) patients, were recruited to evaluate iron overload, cognition, and gut/blood microbiome. TDT patients exhibited greater iron overload than NTDT patients. Most thalassemia patients developed gut dysbiosis, and approximately 25% of the patients developed minor cognitive impairment. Increased Fusobacteriota and Verrucomicrobiota with decreased Fibrobacterota were observed in both TDT and NTDT groups. TDT patients showed more abundant beneficial bacteria: Verrucomicrobia. Iron overload was correlated with cognitive impairment. Increased Butyricimonas and decreased Paraclostridium were associated with higher cognitive function. No trace of blood microbiota was observed. Differences in blood bacterial profiles of thalassemia patients and controls were insignificant. These findings suggest iron overload plays a role in the imbalance of gut microbiota and impaired cognitive function in thalassemia patients. Harnessing probiotic potential from those microbes could prevent the gut-brain disturbance in thalassemia patients.

Bile acids (BAs) exert a profound influence on the body's pathophysiology by intricately shaping the composition of gut bacteria. However, the complex interplay between BAs and gut microbiota has impeded a systematic exploration of their impact on intestinal bacteria. Initially, we investigated the effects of 21 BAs on the growth of 65 gut bacterial strains in vitro. Subsequently, we examined the impact of BAs on the overall composition of intestinal bacteria, both in vivo and in vitro. The results unveiled distinct effects of various BAs on different intestinal strains and their diverse impacts on the composition of gut bacteria. Mechanistically, the inhibition of intestinal strains by BAs occurs through the accumulation of these acids within the strains. The intracellular accumulation of deoxycholic acid (DCA) significantly influenced the growth of intestinal bacteria by impacting ribosome transcription and amino-acid metabolism. The metabolomic analysis underscores the pronounced impact of DCA on amino-acid profiles in both in vivo and in vitro settings. This study not only elucidates the effects of BAs on a diverse range of bacterial strains and their role in shaping the gut microbiota but also reveals underlying mechanisms essential for understanding and maintaining a healthy gut microbiota.

## Gut-first Parkinson's disease is encoded by gut dysbiome.

In Parkinson's patients, intestinal dysbiosis can occur years before clinical diagnosis, implicating the gut and its microbiota in the disease. Recent evidence suggests the gut microbiota may trigger body-first Parkinson Disease (PD), yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate how a dysbiotic microbiome through intestinal immune alterations triggers PD-related neurodegeneration.

Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation. Diet is a key modifiable factor influencing the gut microbiome (GM) and a risk factor for CD. However, the impact of diet modulation on GM function in CD patients is understudied. Herein, we evaluated the effect of a high-fiber, low-fat diet (the Mi-IBD diet) on GM function in CD patients. All participants were instructed to follow the Mi-IBD diet for 8 weeks. One group of CD patients received one-time diet counseling only (Gr1); catered food was supplied for the other three groups, including CD patients (Gr2) and dyads of CD patients and healthy household controls (HHCs) residing within the same household (Gr3-HHC dyads). Stool samples were collected at baseline, week 8, and week 36, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
