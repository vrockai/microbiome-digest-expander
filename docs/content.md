This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## The role of probiotics in women's health: An update narrative review.
 12.01.2024, _LY Wu, TH Yang, YC Ou, H Lin_


Probiotics, live microorganisms that confer health benefits to the host when administered in adequate amounts, have gained considerable attention for their potential role in maintaining women's health. This overview summarizes key clinical findings on the beneficial effects of probiotics in various aspects of women's health. Probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus species, contribute to vaginal health by promoting a balanced vaginal microbiome to prevent infections and maintain an acidic environment. In gynecologic conditions, probiotics show potential in preventing and managing bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and sexually transmitted infections. Probiotic supplementation has also been associated with improvements in metabolic parameters and menstrual irregularities in polycystic ovary syndrome patients. During pregnancy, probiotics may be helpful in reducing the risk of gestational diabetes, maternal group B streptococcal colonization, obstetric anemia, and postpartum mastitis. In recent years, the potential role of probiotics in the prevention and management of gynecologic cancer has gained attention. Further research is needed to better understand the specific mechanisms and determine the optimal Lactobacillus strains and dosages regimens for gynecologic cancer prevention and therapy. In conclusion, probiotics offer a non-invasive and cost-effective approach to support women's health and prevent obstetric and gynecologic complications.

## Circulating Galectin-3 levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A meta-analysis.
 12.01.2024, _SS Bahreiny, MN Bastani, M Aghaei, MR Dabbagh, AH Mahdizade_


Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent endocrine disorder characterized by multifactorial and intricate pathogenesis. The discovery of novel markers has been a significant step toward understanding the mechanisms of PCOS. Galectin-3 has emerged as a novel factor in metabolic disorders. This meta-analysis examines the association between circulating Galectin-3 and PCOS. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to identify relevant articles in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. The search covered the period from January 2000 to March 2023 and followed a predefined search strategy. Eight articles were included in the analysis with a total of 594 participants (322 patients with PCOS and 272 controls). Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95 % confidence interval [CI] were used to evaluate the association between Galectin-3 levels and PCOS. The results indicated a significant association between PCOS and galectin-3 levels (SMD = 0.58; 95 % CI: 0.15-1.01; p = 0.007). In addition, subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in serum Galectin-3 levels in women with PCOS and a higher homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance ratio (SMD = 0.89; 95 % CI: 0.45-1.33; p &lt; 0.001). The researchers also performed meta-regression and subgroup analyses to specify sources of heterogeneity. The results of our meta-analysis suggest an association between increased levels of galectin-3 and PCOS. Galectin-3 plays a significant role in the progression of PCOS and could be used as a novel diagnostic biomarker. Nevertheless, it is essential to perform further studies to confirm and support our conclusions.

## BilR is a gut microbial enzyme that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen.

_Infant, Newborn, Adult, Humans, Bilirubin, Urobilinogen, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Liver, Bacteria_
Metabolism of haem by-products such as bilirubin by humans and their gut microbiota is essential to human health, as excess serum bilirubin can cause jaundice and even neurological damage. The bacterial enzymes that reduce bilirubin to urobilinogen, a key step in this pathway, have remained unidentified. Here we used biochemical analyses and comparative genomics to identify BilR as a gut-microbiota-derived bilirubin reductase that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen. We delineated the BilR sequences from similar reductases through the identification of key residues critical for bilirubin reduction and found that BilR is predominantly encoded by Firmicutes species. Analysis of human gut metagenomes revealed that BilR is nearly ubiquitous in healthy adults, but prevalence is decreased in neonates and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. This discovery sheds light on the role of the gut microbiome in bilirubin metabolism and highlights the significance of the gut-liver axis in maintaining bilirubin homeostasis.

Establishing the infant's gut microbiota has long-term implications on health and immunity. Breastfeeding is recognized as the best practice of infant nutrition in comparison with formula feeding. We evaluated the effects of the primary feeding practices by analyzing the infant growth and the potential association with gut diseases. A cross-sectional and observational study was designed. This study included 55 mothers with infants, who were divided according to their feeding practices in breastfeeding (BF), formula feeding (FF), and combined breast and formula feeding (CF). Anthropometric measurements of the participants were recorded. Additionally, non-invasive fecal samples from the infants were collected to analyze the microbiota by sequencing, immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration (ELISA), and volatile organic compounds (gas chromatography with an electronic nose). Results showed that the microbiota diversity in the BF group was the highest compared to the other two groups. The IgA levels in the BF group were twice as high as those in the FF group. Moreover, the child´s growth in the BF group showed the best infant development when the data were compared at birth to the recollection time, as noted by the correlation with a decreased concentration of toxic volatile organic compounds. Interestingly, the CF group showed a significant difference in health status when the data were compared with the FF group. We conclude that early health practices influence children's growth, which is relevant to further research about how those infants' health evolved.

## Efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection antagonization by rhACE2 ectodomain multimerized onto the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly.

Nanodecoy systems based on analogues of viral cellular receptors assembled onto fluid lipid-based membranes of nano/extravescicles are potential new tools to complement classic therapeutic or preventive antiviral approaches. The need for lipid-based membranes for transmembrane receptor anchorage may pose technical challenges along industrial translation, calling for alternative geometries for receptor multimerization. Here we developed a semisynthetic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanodecoy by multimerizing the biotin labelled virus cell receptor -ACE2- ectodomain onto a poly-avidin nanoparticle (NP) based on the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly-ANANAS. The ability of the assembly to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and the affinity of the ACE2:viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction were measured at different ACE2:NP ratios. At ACE2:NP = 30, 90 % SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition at ACE2 nanomolar concentration was registered on both Wuhan and Omicron variants, with ten-fold higher potency than the monomeric protein. Lower and higher ACE2 densities were less efficient suggesting that functional recognition between multi-ligand NPs and multi-receptor virus surfaces requires optimal geometrical relationships. In vivo studies in mice showed that the biodistribution and safety profiles of the nanodecoy are potentially suitable for preventing viral infection upon nasal instillation. Viral receptor multimerization using ANANAS is a convenient process which, in principle, could be rapidly adapted to counteract also other viral infections.

The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.
