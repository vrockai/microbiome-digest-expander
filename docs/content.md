Therapeutic manipulation of the gut microbiota holds great potential for human health. The mechanisms bacteria use to colonize the gut therefore present valuable targets for clinical intervention. We now report that bacteria use phase separation to enhance fitness in the mammalian gut. We establish that the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the broadly and highly conserved transcription termination factor Rho is necessary and sufficient for phase separation in vivo and in vitro in the human commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Phase separation increases transcription termination by Rho in an IDR-dependent manner. Moreover, the IDR is critical for gene regulation in the gut. Our findings expose phase separation as vital for host-commensal bacteria interactions and relevant for novel clinical applications.

## Gut-microbiome-expressed 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase degrades estradiol and is linked to depression in premenopausal females.
 18.03.2023, _D Li, T Sun, Y Tong, J Le, Q Yao, J Tao, H Liu, W Jiao, Y Mei, J Chen, Z Liu, G Wang, Y Li_


Estradiol decline can result in depressive disorders in females; nevertheless, the causes of this decline are unclear. In this study, we isolated estradiol-degrading Klebsiella aerogenes from the feces of premenopausal females with depression. In mice, gavaging with this strain led to estradiol decline and depression-like behaviors. The gene encoding the estradiol-degrading enzyme in K. aerogenes was identified as 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). Heterologously expressing 3β-HSD resulted in Escherichia coli obtaining the ability to degrade estradiol. Gavaging mice with 3β-HSD-expressing E. coli decreased their serum estradiol levels, causing depression-like behaviors. The prevalence of K. aerogene and 3β-HSD was higher in premenopausal women with depression than in those without depression. These results suggest that the estradiol-degrading bacteria and 3β-HSD enzymes are potential intervention targets for depression treatment in premenopausal women.

## Metagenomic association analysis of cognitive impairment in community-dwelling older adults.
 17.03.2023, _J Li, S Zhu, Y Wang, M Fan, J Dai, C Zhu, K Xu, M Cui, C Suo, L Jin, Y Jiang, X Chen_


The gut microbiota is reportedly involved in neurodegenerative disorders, and exploration of differences in the gut microbiota in different cognitive status could provide clues for early detection and intervention in cognitive impairment. Here, we used data from the Taizhou Imaging Study (N = 516), a community-based cohort, to compare the overall structure of the gut microbiota at the species level through metagenomic sequencing, and to explore associations with cognition. Interestingly, bacteria capable of producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as Bacteroides massiliensis, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans and Eggerthella lenta, that can biotransform polyphenols, were positively associated with better cognitive performance (p &lt; 0.05). Although Diallister invisus and Streptococcus gordonii were not obviously related to cognition, the former was dominant in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), while the later was more abundant in cognitively normal (CN) than MCI groups, and positively associated with cognitive performance (p &lt; 0.05). Functional analysis further supported a potential role of SCFAs and lactic acid in the association between the gut microbiota and cognition. The significant associations persisted after accounting for dietary patterns. Collectively, our results demonstrate an association between the gut microbiota and cognition in the general population, indicating a potential role in cognitive impairment. The findings provide clues for microbiome biomarkers of dementia, and insight for the prevention and treatment of dementia.

## Postbiotics Implication in the Microbiota-Host Intestinal Epithelial Cells Mutualism.
 18.03.2023, _H Kaur, G Kaur, SA Ali_


To sustain host health and provide the microbial community with a nutrient-rich environment, the host and gut microbiota must interact with one another. These interactions between commensal bacterial and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) serve as the first line of defense against gut microbiota in preserving intestinal homeostasis. In this microenvironment, the post-biotics and similar molecules such as p40 exert several beneficial effects through regulation of IECs. Importantly, post-biotics were discovered to be transactivators of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in IECs, inducing protective cellular responses and alleviating colitis. The transient exposure to post-biotics such as p40 during the neonatal period reprograms IECs by upregulation of a methyltransferase, Setd1β, leading to a sustained increase in TGF- β release for the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the intestinal lamina propria and durable protection against colitis in adulthood. This crosstalk between the IECs and post-biotic secreted factors was not reviewed previously. Therefore, this review describes the role of probiotic-derived factors in the sustainability of intestinal health and improving gut homeostasis via certain signaling pathways. In the era of precision medicine and targeted therapies, more basic, preclinical, and clinical evidence is needed to clarify the efficacy of probiotics released as functional factors in maintaining intestinal health and preventing and treating disease.

## Microbiota and growth among infants and children in low-income and middle-income settings.
 17.03.2023, _JM Njunge, JL Walson_


Adequate nutrition is essential but insufficient for optimal childhood growth and development. Increasingly, it is clear that the gut microbiota modulates childhood growth and may be particularly important in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC), where growth faltering, undernutrition, environmental contamination and enteric pathogens are more common. We summarize recent evidence demonstrating the role of the gut microbiota in impacting childhood growth and interventions targeting the gut microbiota to impact growth in children in LMIC settings.

## Cardiometabolic health, diet and the gut microbiome: a meta-omics perspective.
 18.03.2023, _M Valles-Colomer, C Menni, SE Berry, AM Valdes, TD Spector, N Segata_


Cardiometabolic diseases have become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. They have been tightly linked to microbiome taxonomic and functional composition, with diet possibly mediating some of the associations described. Both the microbiome and diet are modifiable, which opens the way for novel therapeutic strategies. High-throughput omics techniques applied on microbiome samples (meta-omics) hold the unprecedented potential to shed light on the intricate links between diet, the microbiome, the metabolome and cardiometabolic health, with a top-down approach. However, effective integration of complementary meta-omic techniques is an open challenge and their application on large cohorts is still limited. Here we review meta-omics techniques and discuss their potential in this context, highlighting recent large-scale efforts and the novel insights they provided. Finally, we look to the next decade of meta-omics research and discuss various translational and clinical pathways to improving cardiometabolic health.

## Oral polymicrobial communities: Assembly, function, and impact on diseases.
 18.03.2023, _G Hajishengallis, RJ Lamont, H Koo_


Oral microbial communities assemble into complex spatial structures. The sophisticated physical and chemical signaling systems underlying the community enable their collective functional regulation as well as the ability to adapt by integrating environmental information. The combined output of community action, as shaped by both intra-community interactions and host and environmental variables, dictates homeostatic balance or dysbiotic disease such as periodontitis and dental caries. Oral polymicrobial dysbiosis also exerts systemic effects that adversely affect comorbidities, in part due to ectopic colonization of oral pathobionts in extra-oral tissues. Here, we review new and emerging concepts that explain the collective functional properties of oral polymicrobial communities and how these impact health and disease both locally and systemically.

## Gut microbiota: a non-target victim of pesticide-induced toxicity.
 16.03.2023, _T Sharma, N Sirpu Natesh, R Pothuraju, SK Batra, S Rachagani_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Pesticides_
The human gut microbiota can be potentially disrupted due to exposure of various environmental contaminants, including pesticides. These contaminants enter into non-target species in multiple ways and cause potential health risks. The gut microbiota-derived metabolites have a significant role in maintaining the host's health by regulating metabolic homeostasis. An imbalance in this homeostasis can result in the development of various diseases and their pathogenesis. Pesticides have hazardous effects on the host's gut microbiota, which is evident in a few recent studies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the effect of pesticide on gut microbiota-mediated metabolic changes in the host, which may provide a better understanding of pesticide-induced toxicity. The present review summarizes the pesticide-induced effects on gut microbiota, which in turn, induces changes in the release of their secondary metabolites that could lead to various host health effects.

## Versatility of bacterial outer membrane vesicles in regulating intestinal homeostasis.
 20.03.2023, _X Wang, S Lin, L Wang, Z Cao, M Zhang, Y Zhang, R Liu, J Liu_


_Humans, Bacterial Outer Membrane, Intestines, Colitis, Epithelial Cells, Extracellular Vesicles_
Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) play vital roles in bacterial communication both intraspecifically and interspecifically. However, extracellular mechanisms of gut microbiota-derived OMVs in the intestine remain poorly understood. Here, we report that OMVs released from Akkermansia muciniphila are able to (i) restore disturbed balance of the gut microbiota by selectively promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacteria through membrane fusion, (ii) elicit mucosal immunoglobulin A response by translocating into Peyer's patches and subsequently activating B cells and dendritic cells, and (iii) maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier by entering intestinal epithelial cells to stimulate the expressions of tight junctions and mucus. We demonstrate that transplantation of gut microbiota-associated OMVs to the intestine can alleviate colitis and enhance anti-programmed cell death protein 1 therapy against colorectal cancer by regulating intestinal homeostasis. This work discloses the importance of gut microbiota-derived OMVs in intestinal ecology, providing an alternative target for disease intervention and treatment.

## Spatial profiling of microbial communities by sequential FISH with error-robust encoding.
 18.03.2023, _Z Cao, W Zuo, L Wang, J Chen, Z Qu, F Jin, L Dai_


Spatial analysis of microbiomes at single cell resolution with high multiplexity and accuracy has remained challenging. Here we present spatial profiling of a microbiome using sequential error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (SEER-FISH), a highly multiplexed and accurate imaging method that allows mapping of microbial communities at micron-scale. We show that multiplexity of RNA profiling in microbiomes can be increased significantly by sequential rounds of probe hybridization and dissociation. Combined with error-correction strategies, we demonstrate that SEER-FISH enables accurate taxonomic identification in complex microbial communities. Using microbial communities composed of diverse bacterial taxa isolated from plant rhizospheres, we apply SEER-FISH to quantify the abundance of each taxon and map microbial biogeography on roots. At micron-scale, we identify clustering of microbial cells from multiple species on the rhizoplane. Under treatment of plant metabolites, we find spatial re-organization of microbial colonization along the root and alterations in spatial association among microbial taxa. Taken together, SEER-FISH provides a useful method for profiling the spatial ecology of complex microbial communities in situ.

## sBGC-hm: An atlas of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters from the human gut microbiome.
 17.03.2023, _H Zou, T Sun, B Jin, S Wang_


Microbial secondary metabolites exhibit potential medicinal value. A large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in the human gut microbiome, which exhibit essential biological activity in microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions, have not been adequately characterised, making it difficult to prioritise these BGCs for experimental characterization. Here, we present the sBGC-hm, an atlas of secondary metabolite BGCs allows researchers to explore the potential therapeutic benefits of these natural products. One of its key features is the ability to assist in optimizing the BGC structure by utilizing the gene co-occurrence matrix obtained from HMP data. Results are viewable online and can be downloaded as spreadsheets.

## Multi-omics Data Deconvolution and Integration: New Methods, Insights, and Translational Implications.
 17.03.2023, _X Wang, BL Fridley_


In the current era of multi-omics, new sequencing and molecular profiling technologies have facilitated our quest for a deeper and broader understanding of the variations and dynamic regulations in human genomes. However, analyzing and integrating data generated from diverse platforms, modalities, and large-scale heterogeneous samples to extract functional and clinically valuable information remains a significant challenge. Here, we first discuss recent advances in methods and algorithms for analyzing data at the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and microbiome levels, followed by emerging methods for leveraging single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data. We also highlight the mechanistic insights that these advances can bring to the field, as well as the current challenges and outlooks relating to their translational and reproducible adoption at the population level. It is evident that novel statistical methods, which were inspired by new assays, will enable the associated molecular profiling pipelines and experimental designs to continuously improve our understanding of the human genome and the downstream consequences in the transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, metabolome, regulome, and microbiome.
