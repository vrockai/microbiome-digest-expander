Extraintestinal symptoms are common in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and include depression and fatigue. These are highly prevalent especially in active disease, potentially due to inflammation-mediated changes in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between structural and functional microbiota characteristics and severity of fatigue and depressive symptoms in patients with active IBD.

_Breast Feeding, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Lactation, Milk, Human, Oligosaccharides, Prospective Studies_
Human milk oligosaccharides play a key role in the maturation of the infant gut microbiome and immune system and are hypothesized to affect growth. This study examined the temporal changes of 24 HMOs and their associations to infant growth and appetitive traits in an exploratory, prospective, observational, study of 41 Filipino mother-infant dyads. Exclusively breastfed, healthy, term infants were enrolled at 21-26 days of age (≈ 0.75 mo) and followed for 6 months. Infant growth measures and appetitive traits were collected at visit 1 (V1) (≈ 0.75 mo), V2 (≈ 1.5 mo), V3 (2.5 mo), V4 (2.75 mo), V5 (4 mo), and V6 (6 mo), while HMOs were measured at V1, V2, V3 and V5. Overall exposure to each HMO was summarized as area under the curve from baseline to 4 months of age and examined in association with each measure of growth at 6 months using linear regression adjusted for maternal age at birth, infant sex, birth weight, and mode of delivery. We saw modest associations between several HMOs and infant growth parameters. Our results suggest that specific HMOs, partly as proxy for milk groups (defined by Secretor and Lewis status), may be associated with head circumference and length, increasing their relevance especially in populations at the lower end of the WHO growth curve. We did not identify the same HMOs associated with infant appetitive traits, indicating that at least in our cohort, changes in appetite were not driving the observed associations between HMOs and growth.Clinical trial registration: NCT03387124.

Integrative analysis of microbiome and metabolome data obtained from human fecal samples is a promising avenue for better understanding the interplay between bacteria and metabolites in the human gut, in both health and disease. However, acquiring, processing, and unifying such datasets from multiple sources is a daunting and challenging task. Here we present a publicly available, simple-to-use, curated dataset collection of paired fecal microbiome-metabolome data from multiple cohorts. This data resource allows researchers to easily obtain multiple fully processed and integrated microbiome-metabolome datasets, facilitating the discovery of universal microbe-metabolite links, benchmark various microbiome-metabolome integration tools, and compare newly identified microbe-metabolite findings to other published datasets.

## Strains to go: interactions of the skin microbiome beyond its species.
 21.10.2022, _R Caldwell, W Zhou, J Oh_


An extraordinary biodiversity of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and even small multicellular eukaryota inhabit the human skin. Genomic innovations have accelerated characterization of this biodiversity both at a species as well as the subspecies, or strain level, which further imparts a tremendous genetic diversity to an individual's skin microbiome. In turn, these advances portend significant species- and strain-specificity in the skin microbiome's functional impact on cutaneous immunity, barrier integrity, aging, and other skin physiologic processes. Future advances in defining strain diversity, spatial distribution, and metabolic diversity for major skin species will be foundational for understanding the microbiome's essentiality to the skin ecosystem and for designing topical therapeutics that leverage or target the skin microbiome.

## Gut bacterial extracellular vesicles: important players in regulating intestinal microenvironment.
 20.10.2022, _X Liang, N Dai, K Sheng, H Lu, J Wang, L Chen, Y Wang_


_Bacteria, Dysbiosis, Extracellular Vesicles, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Lipid Bilayers_
Intestinal microenvironment dysbiosis is one of the major causes of diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer. Microbiota-based strategies have excellent clinical potential in the treatment of repetitive and refractory diseases; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Identification of the internal regulatory mechanism of the gut microbiome and the interaction mechanisms involving bacteria-host is essential to achieve precise control of the gut microbiome and obtain effective clinical data. Gut bacteria-derived extracellular vesicles (GBEVs) are lipid bilayer nanoparticles secreted by the gut microbiota and are considered key players in bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host communication. This review focusses on the role of GBEVs in gut microbiota interactions and bacteria-host communication, and the potential clinical applications of GBEVs.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a phenotype caused by the interaction of host intrinsic factors such as genetics and gut microbiome, and extrinsic factors such as diet and lifestyle. To demonstrate the interplay of intestinal microbiota with obesity, MetS markers, and some dietary ingredients among samples of Egyptian women. This study was a cross-sectional one that included 115 Egyptian women; 82 were obese (59 without MetS and 23 with MetS) and 33 were normal weight. All participants were subjected to anthropometric assessment, 24 h dietary recall, laboratory evaluation of liver enzymes (AST and ALT), leptin, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), C-reactive protein, fasting blood glucose, insulin, and lipid profile, in addition to fecal microbiota analysis for Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroid. Data showed that the obese women with MetS had the highest significant values of the anthropometric and the biochemical parameters. Obese MetS women consumed a diet high in calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrate, and low in fiber and micronutrients. The Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the abundant bacteria among the different gut microbiota, with low Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and insignificant differences between the obese with and without MetS and normal weight women were reported. Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio significantly correlated positively with total cholesterol and LDL-C and negatively with SCFA among obese women with MetS. Findings of this study revealed that dietary factors, dysbiosis, and the metabolic product short chain fatty acids have been implicated in causing metabolic defects.

## The intestinal clock drives the microbiome to maintain gastrointestinal homeostasis.

Diurnal (i.e., 24-hour) oscillations of the gut microbiome have been described in various species including mice and humans. However, the driving force behind these rhythms remains less clear. In this study, we differentiate between endogenous and exogenous time cues driving microbial rhythms. Our results demonstrate that fecal microbial oscillations are maintained in mice kept in the absence of light, supporting a role of the host's circadian system rather than representing a diurnal response to environmental changes. Intestinal epithelial cell-specific ablation of the core clock gene Bmal1 disrupts rhythmicity of microbiota. Targeted metabolomics functionally link intestinal clock-controlled bacteria to microbial-derived products, in particular branched-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids. Microbiota transfer from intestinal clock-deficient mice into germ-free mice altered intestinal gene expression, enhanced lymphoid organ weights and suppressed immune cell recruitment. These results highlight the importance of functional intestinal clocks for microbiota composition and function, which is required to balance the host's gastrointestinal homeostasis.

Clinical studies revealed that early-life adverse events contribute to the development of IBS in adulthood. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between prenatal stress (PS), gut microbiota and visceral hypersensitivity with a focus on bacterial lipopeptides containing γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
