## The anti-inflammatory effect of bacterial short chain fatty acids is partially mediated by endocannabinoids.
 18.11.2021, _A Vijay, A Kouraki, S Gohir, J Turnbull, A Kelly, V Chapman, DA Barrett, WJ Bulsiewicz, AM Valdes_


The endocannabinoid (EC) system has pleiotropic functions in the body. It plays a key role in energy homeostasis and the development of metabolic disorders being a mediator in the relationship between the gut microbiota and host metabolism. In the current study we explore the functional interactions between the endocannabinoid system and the gut microbiome in modulating inflammatory markers. Using data from a 6 week exercise intervention (treatment n = 38 control n = 40) and a cross sectional validation cohort (n = 35), we measured the associations of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), anandamide (AEA), N-oleoylethanolamine (OEA) and N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) with gut microbiome composition, gut derived metabolites (SCFAs) and inflammatory markers both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. At baseline AEA and OEA were positively associated with alpha diversity (β(SE) = .32 (.06), P = .002; .44 (.04), P &lt; .001) and with SCFA producing bacteria such as Bifidobacterium (2-AG β(SE) = .21 (.10), P &lt; .01; PEA β(SE) = .23 (.08), P &lt; .01), Coprococcus 3 and Faecalibacterium (PEA β(SE) = .29 (.11), P = .01; .25 (.09), P &lt; .01) and negatively associated with Collinsella (AEA β(SE) = -.31 (.12), P = .004). Additionally, we found AEA to be positively associated with SCFA Butyrate (β(SE) = .34 (.15), P = .01). AEA, OEA and PEA all increased significantly with the exercise intervention but remained constant in the control group. Changes in AEA correlated with SCFA butyrate and increases in AEA and PEA correlated with decreases in TNF-ɑ and IL-6 statistically mediating one third of the effect of SCFAs on these cytokines. Our data show that the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs are partly mediated by the EC system suggesting that there may be other pathways involved in the modulation of the immune system via the gut microbiome.

## Bile acids as regulatory molecules and potential targets in metabolic diseases.
 18.11.2021, _AJ Xie, CT Mai, YZ Zhu, XC Liu, Y Xie_


Bile acids are important hydroxylated steroids that are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol for intestinal absorption of lipids and other fatty-nutrient. They also display remarkable and immense functions such as regulating immune responses, managing the apoptosis of cells, participating in glucose metabolism, and so on. Some bile acids were used for the treatment or prevention of diseases such as gallstones, primary biliary cirrhosis, and colorectal cancer. Meanwhile, the accumulation of toxic bile acids leads to apoptosis, necrosis, and inflammation. Alteration of bile acids metabolism, as well as the gut microbiota that interacted with bile acids, contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the current functions and pre-clinical or clinical applications of bile acids, and to further discuss the alteration of bile acids in metabolic disorders as well as the manipulation of bile acids metabolism as potential therapeutic targets.

## Renaissance for Phage-Based Bacterial Control.
 18.11.2021, _C Schwarz, J Mathieu, JA Laverde Gomez, P Yu, PJJ Alvarez_


Bacteriophages (phages) are an underutilized biological resource with vast potential for pathogen control and microbiome editing. Phage research and commercialization have increased rapidly in biomedical and agricultural industries, but adoption has been limited elsewhere. Nevertheless, converging advances in DNA sequencing, bioinformatics, microbial ecology, and synthetic biology are now poised to broaden phage applications beyond pathogen control toward the manipulation of microbial communities for defined functional improvements. Enhancements in sequencing combined with network analysis make it now feasible to identify and disrupt microbial associations to elicit desirable shifts in community structure or function, indirectly modulate species abundance, and target hub or keystone species to achieve broad functional shifts. Sequencing and bioinformatic advancements are also facilitating the use of temperate phages for safe gene delivery applications. Finally, integration of synthetic biology stands to create novel phage chassis and modular genetic components. While some fundamental, regulatory, and commercialization barriers to widespread phage use remain, many major challenges that have impeded the field now have workable solutions. Thus, a new dawn for phage-based (chemical-free) precise biocontrol and microbiome editing is on the horizon to enhance, suppress, or modulate microbial activities important for public health, food security, and more sustainable energy production and water reuse.

## Sulphur metabolism in colon cancer tissues: a case report and literature review.

Sulphur-containing compounds have been linked to colorectal cancer by factors such as the presence of methyl mercaptan in intestinal gas and long-term dietary intake associated with sulphur-metabolizing microbiota. Therefore, this current case report hypothesized that active sulphur metabolism in colorectal cancer results in the formation of sulphur compounds in the intestine and, thus, examined sulphur metabolites possibly associated with sulphur respiration in colon cancer tissues. The patient was a 73-year-old female that underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for ascending colon cancer. During the surgery, colon cancer tissues and normal intestinal mucosa samples were collected. After optimizing the sample concentrations for homogenization (pre-treatment), the samples were stabilized using a hydroxyphenyl-containing derivative and the relevant metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that cysteine persulfide and cysteine trisulfide levels were higher in colon cancer tissues than in normal mucosal tissues. Thus, sulphur metabolism, possibly sulphur respiration, is enhanced in colon cancer tissues.

## Dietary fatty acids in gut health: Absorption, metabolism and function.
 18.11.2021, _E Xu, C Chen, J Fu, L Zhu, J Shu, M Jin, Y Wang, X Zong_


In biological responses, fatty acids (FA) are absorbed and metabolized in the form of substrates for energy production. The molecular structures (number of double bonds and chain length) and composition of dietary FA impact digestion, absorption and metabolism, and the biological roles of FA. Recently, increasing evidence indicates that FA are essentially utilized as an energy source and are signaling molecules that exert physiological activity of gut microbiota and immune responses. In addition, FA could serve as natural ligands for orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), also called free fatty acid receptors (FFAR), which intertwine metabolic and immune systems via multiple mechanisms. The present review explores the recent findings on FA absorption and its impact on gut health, particularly addressing the mechanism by which dietary FA potentially influences intestinal microbiota and epithelial functions. Also, this work attempts to uncover research ideas for devising future strategies for manipulating the composition of dietary FA to regulate gut health and support a normal immune system for metabolic and immune disorders.

## The search for aliens within us: a review of evidence and theory regarding the foetal microbiome.
 17.11.2021, _R Cariño, L Takayasu, W Suda, H Masuoka, K Hirayama, S Konishi, M Umezaki_


The microbiome is believed to be established during the birthing process through exposure to the maternal microbiome and immediate external environment. The absence of a microbiome prior to birth is based on the sterile womb hypothesis, which was formulated at the beginning of the 20th century and is supported primarily by the culture-based approach in microbiological studies.Findings of bacterial presence in products of fertilization such as the placenta, amniotic fluid, foetal membranes, and umbilical cord blood in studies using next-generation DNA sequencing technologies began to challenge the sterile nature of the intrauterine environment during gestation. These studies have been mainly criticized by their approach to contamination and inconclusive evidence of viability. The implications of bacterial presence in utero are far reaching in medicine and basic sciences. If commensal bacteria exist in the foetus, antibiotic therapies in pregnancy particularly for asymptomatic cases will need to be re-evaluated. Experimental studies utilizing gnotobiology may also be impacted by a realignment of theory.This review of existing literature aims to provide insight into the existence of bacteria in utero, specifically the foetal microbiome through analysis of experimental evidence and theoretical concepts, and to suggest approaches that may further provide clarity into this inquiry.
