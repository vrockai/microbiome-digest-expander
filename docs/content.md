## Comprehensive Analysis of Bortezomib-Induced Adverse Events Using the Japanese Real-World Database.
 16.12.2021, _A Satoki, M Uchida, M Fujiwara, Y Uesawa, T Shimizu_


Bortezomib is used as first-line therapy for multiple myeloma. Observational studies based on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database analysis and systematic reviews indicate that the incidence of peripheral neuropathy and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) tends to be higher with bortezomib than that of other drugs. In a comprehensive analysis assessing drugs that cause peripheral neuropathy in Japanese patients, the incidence of bortezomib-induced adverse events (AEs) was reportedly high. However, a comprehensive assessment of bortezomib is lacking.
