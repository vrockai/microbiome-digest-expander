## An ancient antimicrobial protein co-opted by a fungal plant pathogen for in planta mycobiome manipulation.

Microbes typically secrete a plethora of molecules to promote niche colonization. Soil-dwelling microbes are well-known producers of antimicrobials that are exploited to outcompete microbial coinhabitants. Also, plant pathogenic microbes secrete a diversity of molecules into their environment for niche establishment. Upon plant colonization, microbial pathogens secrete so-called effector proteins that promote disease development. While such effectors are typically considered to exclusively act through direct host manipulation, we recently reported that the soil-borne, fungal, xylem-colonizing vascular wilt pathogen Verticillium dahliae exploits effector proteins with antibacterial properties to promote host colonization through the manipulation of beneficial host microbiota. Since fungal evolution preceded land plant evolution, we now speculate that a subset of the pathogen effectors involved in host microbiota manipulation evolved from ancient antimicrobial proteins of terrestrial fungal ancestors that served in microbial competition prior to the evolution of plant pathogenicity. Here, we show that V. dahliae has co-opted an ancient antimicrobial protein as effector, named VdAMP3, for mycobiome manipulation in planta. We show that VdAMP3 is specifically expressed to ward off fungal niche competitors during resting structure formation in senescing mesophyll tissues. Our findings indicate that effector-mediated microbiome manipulation by plant pathogenic microbes extends beyond bacteria and also concerns eukaryotic members of the plant microbiome. Finally, we demonstrate that fungal pathogens can exploit plant microbiome-manipulating effectors in a life stage-specific manner and that a subset of these effectors has evolved from ancient antimicrobial proteins of fungal ancestors that likely originally functioned in manipulation of terrestrial biota.

## Seed inhabiting bacterial endophytes of maize promote seedling establishment and provide protection against fungal disease.
 02.12.2021, _G Pal, K Kumar, A Verma, SK Verma_


Bacteria from different crops and plant varieties have been shown to possess enormous growth promotional attributes. The study aimed to investigate the role of the endophytic microbiome of seeds of corn in improving the growth of seedlings of two different varieties of maize crops (K-25 and baby corn). Furthermore, the study also assessed the role of these bacteria in the protection of seedlings from fungal pathogens. Total twenty-three endophytic bacterial strains were isolated from maize seeds and identified using 16S rDNA sequencing. Most of the isolates had the ability to synthesize auxin (70 %) and solubilize phosphate (74 %), while all the isolates showed nitrogen fixation ability. Some isolates also showed antagonistic activity against phytopathogenic fungi including Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium sp. suggesting their biocontrol potential. The presence of different lipopeptide genes including bacillomycin D, fengycin, iturin A and surfactin was confirmed in some of the isolates. We observed that treating seeds with an antibiotic compromised the seedlings' growth; however, re-inoculation with endophytic isolates (ZM1/Lysinibacillus sp. and ZM2/Paenibacillus dendritiformis) restored the growth of the seedlings in terms of improved root and shoot development in comparison to non-inoculated controls. The colonization of inoculated bacteria on the root surface was visualized using fluorescent microscopy. Seedling protection assay showed that treated seeds (with ZMW8/ Bacillus velezensis) were protected from fungal infestation (Fusarium verticillioides) even after 12 days of inoculation in comparison to the uninoculated control. The study concludes that indigenous seed-associated bacteria of maize play a major role during seed germination, seedling formation and protect them from phytopathogens.
