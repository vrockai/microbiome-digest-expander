Mankind has recognized the value of land plants as renewable sources of food, medicine, and materials for millennia. Throughout human history, agricultural methods were continuously modified and improved to meet the changing needs of civilization. Today, our rapidly growing population requires further innovation to address the practical limitations and serious environmental concerns associated with current industrial and agricultural practices. Microalgae are a diverse group of unicellular photosynthetic organisms that are emerging as next-generation resources with the potential to address urgent industrial and agricultural demands. The extensive biological diversity of algae can be leveraged to produce a wealth of valuable bioproducts, either naturally or via genetic manipulation. Microalgae additionally possess a set of intrinsic advantages, such as low production costs, no requirement for arable land, and the capacity to grow rapidly in both large-scale outdoor systems and scalable, fully contained photobioreactors. Here, we review technical advancements, novel fields of application, and products in the field of algal biotechnology to illustrate how algae could present high-tech, low-cost, and environmentally friendly solutions to many current and future needs of our society. We discuss how emerging technologies such as synthetic biology, high-throughput phenomics, and the application of internet of things (IoT) automation to algal manufacturing technology can advance the understanding of algal biology and, ultimately, drive the establishment of an algal-based bioeconomy.

## Evaluation of multi-starter S. cerevisiae/ D. bruxellensis cultures for mimicking and accelerating transformations occurring during barrel ageing of beer.
 26.04.2020, _E Coelho, M Azevedo, JA Teixeira, T Tavares, JM Oliveira, L Domingues_


During beer ageing, endogenous barrel microbes grow spontaneously and transform wort/beer composition, being Dekkera bruxellensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae among the main contributors to the chemical and sensory profile of aged beer. This work aims at the application of multi-starter cultures to mimic and accelerate biological modifications occurring during barrel ageing of beer, in controlled fermentation processes. Co-cultures of D.bruxellensis/S.cerevisiae were conducted under conditions commonly found in barrel aged beer production: different pitching rates, high glucose concentration and presence of ethanol and wood extracts. Selective pressures and competition between yeasts influenced microbial growth and metabolite production, namely ethanol, acetic acid and target volatile compounds (esters, alcohols, terpenols, volatile acids and volatile phenols). Metabolic profiles of co-cultures combined traits of both species, and differed from those of pure cultures. Lastly, multi-starters were successfully applied in combination with wood in a controlled and accelerated fermentation process for mimicking barrel ageing transformations.

## Combining omics technologies with CRISPR-based genome editing to study food microbes.
 24.03.2020, _M Pan, R Barrangou_


The implementation of omics technologies such as genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of microbiomes, and shed light on the functional attributes and mechanisms of action underlying the ability of probiotics to impact host health and starter cultures to drive food fermentation. Recently, molecular machines from CRISPR-Cas systems have redefined the gene editing toolbox and democritized our ability to alter the genome of food microorganisms. An integrated approach in which CRISPR-based genome editing is informed by omics studies is poised to enable the engineering of microorganisms and the formulation of microbiomes impacting the food supply chain. Here, we highlight the current applications of omics technologies in food microorganisms and CRISPR-based genome editing technologies in bacteria, and discuss how this integrated approach enables effective engineering of food microbes to generate enhanced probiotic strains, develop novel biotherapeutics and alter microbial communities in food matrices.

## Stochasticity in microbiology: managing unpredictability to reach the Sustainable Development Goals.
 20.04.2020, _J De Vrieze, T De Mulder, S Matassa, J Zhou, LT Angenent, N Boon, W Verstraete_


Pure (single) cultures of microorganisms and mixed microbial communities (microbiomes) have been important for centuries in providing renewable energy, clean water and food products to human society and will continue to play a crucial role to pursue the Sustainable Development Goals. To use microorganisms effectively, microbial engineered processes require adequate control. Microbial communities are shaped by manageable deterministic processes, but also by stochastic processes, which can promote unforeseeable variations and adaptations. Here, we highlight the impact of stochasticity in single culture and microbiome engineering. First, we discuss the concepts and mechanisms of stochasticity in relation to microbial ecology of single cultures and microbiomes. Second, we discuss the consequences of stochasticity in relation to process performance and human health, which are reflected in key disadvantages and important opportunities. Third, we propose a suitable decision tool to deal with stochasticity in which monitoring of stochasticity and setting the boundaries of stochasticity by regulators are central aspects. Stochasticity may give rise to some risks, such as the presence of pathogens in microbiomes. We argue here that by taking the necessary precautions and through clever monitoring and interpretation, these risks can be mitigated.

## Role of Microbiome and Antibiotics in Autoimmune Diseases.
 22.04.2020, _R Vangoitsenhoven, GAM Cresci_


The global rise in the incidence of autoimmune diseases has paralleled the widespread use of antibiotics. Recently, the gut microbiome has been shown to be key in the development and maturation of a normal immune system, and a range of microbial disturbances have been associated with the development and activity of several autoimmune diseases. Here, we aim to provide an overview of the mechanistic crosstalk between the human microbiome, the immune system, and antibiotics. The disease-associated microbial gut dysbiosis, the potential role of antibiotics in the development and treatment of autoimmune diseases, and the manipulation of the gut microbiome with prebiotics and probiotics is discussed using 2 key autoimmune diseases as an example: inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes. Although some data suggest that widespread use of antibiotics may facilitate autoimmunity through gut dysbiosis, there are also data to suggest antibiotics may hold the potential to improve disease activity. Currently, the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on several autoimmune diseases is being studied in clinical trials, and several preclinical studies are revealing promising results with probiotic and prebiotic therapies.

## Isolation and characterization of diverse microbial representatives from the human skin microbiome.
 23.04.2020, _CM Timm, K Loomis, W Stone, T Mehoke, B Brensinger, M Pellicore, PPA Staniczenko, C Charles, S Nayak, DK Karig_


The skin micro-environment varies across the body, but all sites are host to microorganisms that can impact skin health. Some of these organisms are true commensals which colonize a unique niche on the skin, while open exposure of the skin to the environment also results in the transient presence of diverse microbes with unknown influences on skin health. Culture-based studies of skin microbiota suggest that skin microbes can affect skin properties, immune responses, pathogen growth, and wound healing.

## Altered gut microbial profile is associated with abnormal metabolism activity of Autism Spectrum Disorder.
 21.04.2020, _Z Dan, X Mao, Q Liu, M Guo, Y Zhuang, Z Liu, K Chen, J Chen, R Xu, J Tang, L Qin, B Gu, K Liu, C Su, F Zhang, Y Xia, Z Hu, X Liu_


Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. To enhance the understanding of the gut microbiota structure in ASD children at different ages as well as the relationship between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, we first used the 16S rRNA sequencing to evaluate the gut microbial population in a cohort of 143 children aged 2-13 years old. We found that the α-diversity of ASD group showed no significant change with age, while the TD group showed increased α-diversity with age, which indicates that the compositional development of the gut microbiota in ASD varies at different ages in ways that are not consistent with TD group. Recent studies have shown that chronic constipation is one of the most commonly obvious gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms along with ASD core symptoms. To further investigate the potential interaction effects between ASD and GI symptoms, the 30 C-ASD and their aged-matched TD were picked out to perform metagenomics analysis. We observed that C-ASD group displayed decreased diversity, depletion of species of Sutterella, Prevotella, and Bacteroides as well as dysregulation of associated metabolism activities, which may involve in the pathogenesis of C-ASD. Consistent with metagenomic analysis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) revealed some of the differential metabolites between C-ASD and TD group were involved in the metabolic network of neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, histidine, and GABA. Furthermore, we found these differences in metabolites were associated with altered abundance of specific bacteria. The study suggested possible future modalities for ASD intervention through targeting the specific bacteria associated with neurotransmitter metabolism.

## Seasonal variation in gut microbiota composition: cross-sectional evidence from Ukrainian population.
 25.04.2020, _A Koliada, V Moseiko, M Romanenko, L Piven, O Lushchak, N Kryzhanovska, V Guryanov, A Vaiserman_


Gut microbiota composition is known to depend on environmental (diet, day length, infections, xenobiotic exposure) and lifestyle (alcohol/drug intake, physical activity) factors. All these factors fluctuate seasonally, especially in areas with highly variable climatic conditions between seasons. Seasonal microbiota changes were reported in several previous studies. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether there is a seasonal variability in the gut microbiota composition in Ukrainian population. In contrast to previous studies performed on small-size samples using a longitudinal design, we used cross-sectional design with a large sample size (n = 769). Determination of microbial composition at the level of major microbial phyla was performed by qRT-PCR.

## Effects of hydrolyzed fish protein and autolyzed yeast as substitutes of fishmeal in the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) diet, on fish intestinal microbiome.
 25.04.2020, _S Rimoldi, E Gini, JFA Koch, F Iannini, F Brambilla, G Terova_


This study evaluated the effects of partial substitution of dietary fishmeal (FM) with either fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) or autolysed dried yeast (HiCell®, Biorigin, Brazil) on intestinal microbiota of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). A total number of 720 fish of 122.18 ± 6.22 g were fed for 92 days with three different diets in triplicate (3 tanks/diet). A diet based on FM/vegetable meal was used as control. The other two diets were formulated by replacing FM with 5% of either FPH or HiCell®. To analyze the gut microbiota associated to autochthonous and allochthonous microbial communities, the Illumina MiSeq platform for sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and QIIME pipeline were used.

## (My Microbiome) Would Walk 10,000 miles: Maintenance and Turnover of Microbial Communities in Introduced Dung Beetles.
 21.04.2020, _ES Parker, ILG Newton, AP Moczek_


Host-associated microbes facilitate diverse biotic and abiotic interactions between hosts and their environments. Experimental alterations of host-associated microbial communities frequently decrease host fitness, yet much less is known about if and how host-microbiome interactions are altered by natural perturbations, such as introduction events. Here, we begin to assess this question in Onthophagus dung beetles, a species-rich and geographically widely distributed genus whose members rely on vertically transmitted microbiota to support normal development. Specifically, we investigated to what extent microbiome community membership shifts during host introduction events and the relative significance of ancestral associations and novel environmental conditions in the structuring of microbial communities of introduced host species. Our results demonstrate that both evolutionary history and local environmental forces structure the microbial communities of these animals, but that their relative importance is shaped by the specific circumstances that characterize individual introduction events. Furthermore, we identify microbial taxa such as Dysgonomonas that may constitute members of the core Onthophagus microbiome regardless of host population or species, but also Wolbachia which associates with Onthophagus beetles in a species or even population-specific manner. We discuss the implications of our results for our understanding of the evolutionary ecology of symbiosis in dung beetles and beyond.

## Nocardiopsis deserti sp. nov., isolated from a high altitude Atacama Desert soil.
 22.04.2020, _MD Asem, N Salam, H Idris, XT Zhang, AT Bull, WJ Li, M Goodfellow_


The taxonomic status of a Nocardiopsis strain, designated H13T, isolated from a high altitude Atacama Desert soil, was established by using a polyphasic approach. The strain was found to have chemotaxonomic, cultural and morphological characteristics consistent with its classification within the genus Nocardiopsis and formed a well-supported clade in the Nocardiopsis phylogenomic tree together with the type strains of Nocardiopsis alborubida, Nocardiopsis dassonvillei and Nocardiopsis synnematoformans. Strain H13T was distinguished from its closest relatives by low average nucleotide identity (93.2-94.9 %) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (52.5-62.4 %) values calculated from draft genome assemblies and by a range of phenotypic properties. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that the isolate be assigned to the genus Nocardiopsis as Nocardiopsis deserti sp. nov. with isolate H13T (=CGMCC 4.7585T=KCTC 49249T) as the type strain.

## Unraveling Heterogeneity of Coral Microbiome Assemblages in Tropical and Subtropical Corals in the South China Sea.
 24.04.2020, _S Gong, X Jin, L Ren, Y Tan, X Xia_


Understanding the coral microbiome is critical for predicting the fidelity of coral symbiosis with growing surface seawater temperature (SST). However, how the coral microbiome will respond to increasing SST is still understudied. Here, we compared the coral microbiome assemblages among 73 samples across six typical South China Sea coral species in two thermal regimes. The results revealed that the composition of microbiome varied across both coral species and thermal regimes, except for Porites lutea. The tropical coral microbiome displayed stronger heterogeneity and had a more un-compacted ecological network than subtropical coral microbiome. The coral microbiome was more strongly determined by environmental factors than host specificity. γ- (32%) and α-proteobacteria (19%), Bacteroidetes (14%), Firmicutes (14%), Actinobacteria (6%) and Cyanobacteria (2%) dominated the coral microbiome. Additionally, bacteria inferred to play potential roles in host nutrients metabolism, several keystone bacteria detected in human and plant rhizospheric microbiome were retrieved in explored corals. This study not only disentangles how different host taxa and microbiome interact and how such an interaction is affected by thermal regimes, but also identifies previously unrecognized keystone bacteria in corals, and also infers the community structure of coral microbiome will be changed from a compacted to an un-compacted network under elevated SST.

## Microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of hypersaline sediments in Orca Basin.
 21.04.2020, _LM Nigro, FJ Elling, KU Hinrichs, SB Joye, A Teske_


In deep ocean hypersaline basins, the combination of high salinity, unusual ionic composition and anoxic conditions represents significant challenges for microbial life. We used geochemical porewater characterization and DNA sequencing based taxonomic surveys to enable environmental and microbial characterization of anoxic hypersaline sediments and brines in the Orca Basin, the largest brine basin in the Gulf of Mexico. Full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from hypersaline sediments and the overlying brine were dominated by the uncultured halophilic KB1 lineage, Deltaproteobacteria related to cultured sulfate-reducing halophilic genera, and specific lineages of heterotrophic Bacteroidetes. Archaeal clones were dominated by members of the halophilic methanogen genus Methanohalophilus, and the ammonia-oxidizing Marine Group I (MG-I) within the Thaumarchaeota. Illumina sequencing revealed higher phylum- and subphylum-level complexity, especially in lower-salinity sediments from the Orca Basin slope. Illumina and clone library surveys consistently detected MG-I Thaumarchaeota and halotolerant Deltaproteobacteria in the hypersaline anoxic sediments, but relative abundances of the KB1 lineage differed between the two sequencing methods. The stable isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon and methane in porewater, and sulfate concentrations decreasing downcore indicated methanogenesis and sulfate reduction in the anoxic sediments. While anaerobic microbial processes likely occur at low rates near their maximal salinity thresholds in Orca Basin, long-term accumulation of reaction products leads to high methane concentrations and reducing conditions within the Orca Basin brine and sediments.

## Ecological Processes Affecting Long-Term Eukaryote and Prokaryote Biofilm Persistence in Nitrogen Removal from Sewage.
 24.04.2020, _IL Angell, L Bergaust, JF Hanssen, EM Aasen, K Rudi_


The factors affecting long-term biofilm stability in sewage treatment remain largely unexplored. We therefore analyzed moving bed bioreactors (MBBRs) biofilm composition and function two years apart from four reactors in a nitrogen-removal sewage treatment plant. Multivariate ANOVA revealed a similar prokaryote microbiota composition on biofilm carriers from the same reactors, where reactor explained 84.6% of the variance, and year only explained 1.5%. Eukaryotes showed a less similar composition with reactor explaining 56.8% of the variance and year 9.4%. Downstream effects were also more pronounced for eukaryotes than prokaryotes. For prokaryotes, carbon source emerged as a potential factor for deterministic assembly. In the two reactors with methanol as a carbon source, the bacterial genus Methylotenera dominated, with M. versatilis as the most abundant species. M. versatilis showed large lineage diversity. The lineages mainly differed with respect to potential terminal electron acceptor usage (nitrogen oxides and oxygen). Searches in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database indicate a global distribution of the M. versatilis strains, with methane-containing sediments as the main habitat. Taken together, our results support long-term prokaryote biofilm persistence, while eukaryotes were less persistent.
