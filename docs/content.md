## Severe COVID-19, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, and Kawasaki disease: immunological mechanisms, clinical manifestations and management.
 21.11.2020, _J Kabeerdoss, RK Pilania, R Karkhele, TS Kumar, D Danda, S Singh_


Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) is a pediatric hyperinflammation disorder caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has now been reported from several countries the world over. Some of the clinical manifestations of MIS-C mimic Kawasaki disease (KD) shock syndrome. MIS-C develops 4-6 weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and is presumably initiated by adaptive immune response. Though it has multisystem involvement, it is the cardiovascular manifestations that are most prominent. High titres of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are seen in these patients. As this is a new disease entity, its immunopathogenesis is not fully elucidated. Whether it has some overlap with KD is still unclear. Current treatment guidelines recommend use of intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose corticosteroids as first-line treatment. Mortality rates of MIS-C are lower compared to adult forms of severe COVID-19 disease.

## Amoebae in Chronic, Polymicrobial Endodontic Infections Are Associated with Altered Microbial Communities of Increased Virulence.
 23.11.2020, _G Koller, F Foschi, P Mitchell, E Witherden, K Bruce, F Mannocci_


Infections of the root canal space involve polymicrobial biofilms and lead to chronic, low grade inflammatory responses arising from the seeding of microbes and by-products. Acute exacerbation and/or disseminating infections occur when established microbial communities undergo sudden changes in phenotypic behaviour.

## Distinct Features of Autoimmune Gastritis in Patients with Open-Type Chronic Gastritis in Japan.
 01.11.2020, _M Tsuboi, R Niikura, Y Hayakawa, Y Hirata, T Ushiku, K Koike_


In Asia, the incidences of Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancer are high, but their association with autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is unclear. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients endoscopically diagnosed with chronic gastritis between 2005 and 2017. AIG was diagnosed according to anti-parietal cell antibody positivity. Laboratory, histological findings, and gastric cancer incidence were compared between AIG and non-AIG patients. The AIG group had more females and a higher rate of thyroid disease. Serum levels of gastrin were significantly higher in AIG patients (mean 1412 and 353 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.001). The endoscopic findings included a significantly higher percentage of corpus-dominant atrophy in AIG (31.67%) than in non-AIG (7.04%) patients (p &lt; 0.001). Clusters of ECL cells were observed in 28% of AIG patients and 7% of non-AIG patients (p = 0.032). The cumulative incidence of gastric cancer at 5 and 10 years was 0% and 0.03% in the AIG group and 0.03% and 0.05% in the non-AIG group, and no significant difference in gastric cancer incidence was observed. Despite significant differences in gastrin levels between AIG and non-AIG patients, there was no evidence of an impact of AIG on the incidence of gastric cancer.

## The Gut Ecosystem: A Critical Player in Stroke.
 18.11.2020, _R Delgado Jiménez, C Benakis_


The intestinal microbiome is emerging as a critical factor in health and disease. The microbes, although spatially restricted to the gut, are communicating and modulating the function of distant organs such as the brain. Stroke and other neurological disorders are associated with a disrupted microbiota. In turn, stroke-induced dysbiosis has a major impact on the disease outcome by modulating the immune response. In this review, we present current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiome in stroke, one of the most devastating brain disorders worldwide with very limited therapeutic options, and we discuss novel insights into the gut-immune-brain axis after an ischemic insult. Understanding the nature of the gut bacteria-brain crosstalk may lead to microbiome-based therapeutic approaches that can improve patient recovery.

## Lung microbiome and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Possible link and implications.
 28.09.2020, _S Khatiwada, A Subedi_


Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease begins as an infection of lungs, which is self-limiting in the majority of infections; however, some develop severe respiratory distress and organ failures. Lung microbiome, though neglected previously have received interest recently because of its association with several respiratory diseases and immunity. Lung microbiome can modify the risk and consequences of COVID-19 disease by activating an innate and adaptive immune response. In this review, we examine the current evidence on COVID-19 disease and lung microbiome, and how lung microbiome can affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcomes of this disease. To date there is no direct evidence from human or animal studies on the role of lung microbiome in modifying COVID-19 disease; however, related studies support that microbiome can play an essential role in developing immunity against viral infections. Future studies need to be undertaken to find the relationship between lung microbiome and COVID-19 disease.
