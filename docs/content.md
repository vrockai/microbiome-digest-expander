## Low booster uptake in cancer patients despite health benefits.
 14.11.2023, _JC Figueiredo, J Levy, SY Choi, AM Xu, NM Merin, O Hamid, T Lemos, N Nguyen, M Nadri, A Gonzalez, S Mahov, JM Darrah, J Gong, RL Paquette, AC Mita, RA Vescio, SJ Salvy, I Mehmi, AE Hendifar, R Natale, WG Tourtellotte, V Krishnan Ramanujan, CA Huynh, K Sobhani, KL Reckamp, AA Merchant_


Patients with cancer are at increased risk of death from COVID-19 and have reduced immune responses to SARS-CoV2 vaccines, necessitating regular boosters. We performed comprehensive chart reviews, surveys of patients attitudes, serology for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and T-cell receptor (TCR) β sequencing for cellular responses on a cohort of 982 cancer patients receiving active cancer therapy accrued between November-3-2020 and Mar-31-2023. We found that 92·3% of patients received the primer vaccine, 70·8% received one monovalent booster, but only 30·1% received a bivalent booster. Booster uptake was lower under age 50, and among African American or Hispanic patients. Nearly all patients seroconverted after 2+ booster vaccinations (&gt;99%) and improved cellular responses, demonstrating that repeated boosters could overcome poor response to vaccination. Receipt of booster vaccinations was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR=0·61, P=0·024). Booster uptake in high-risk cancer patients remains low and strategies to encourage booster uptake are needed.

Companion animals can contribute to the physical and mental health of people and often live in very close association with their owners. However, the antibiotic resistome carried by companion animals and the impact they have on their owners and living environment remain unclear. In this study, we compared the ARG profiles of cats, humans, and their living environments using metagenomic analysis to identify the core ARGs in the cat and human gut and explore the potential impact of cats on ARGs in the human gut through the environment.

## A high-throughput and low-waste viability assay for microbes.
 03.11.2023, _CT Meyer, GK Lynch, DF Stamo, EJ Miller, A Chatterjee, JM Kralj_


Counting viable cells is a universal practice in microbiology. The colony-forming unit (CFU) assay has remained the gold standard to measure viability across disciplines, but it is time-intensive and resource-consuming. Here we describe the geometric viability assay (GVA) that replicates CFU measurements over 6 orders of magnitude while reducing over 10-fold the time and consumables required. GVA computes a sample's viable cell count on the basis of the distribution of embedded colonies growing inside a pipette tip. GVA is compatible with Gram-positive and Gram-negative planktonic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis), biofilms and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Laborious CFU experiments such as checkerboard assays, treatment time-courses and drug screens against slow-growing cells are simplified by GVA. The ease and low cost of GVA evinces that it can replace existing viability assays and enable viability measurements at previously impractical scales.

## Comparison of gene clustering criteria reveals intrinsic uncertainty in pangenome analyses.

_Phylogeny, Reproducibility of Results, Uncertainty, Genome Size, Cluster Analysis_
A key step for comparative genomics is to group open reading frames into functionally and evolutionarily meaningful gene clusters. Gene clustering is complicated by intraspecific duplications and horizontal gene transfers that are frequent in prokaryotes. In consequence, gene clustering methods must deal with a trade-off between identifying vertically transmitted representatives of multicopy gene families, which are recognizable by synteny conservation, and retrieving complete sets of species-level orthologs. We studied the implications of adopting homology, orthology, or synteny conservation as formal criteria for gene clustering by performing comparative analyses of 125 prokaryotic pangenomes.

## ACR: metagenome-assembled prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome refinement tool.
 02.11.2023, _HJ Seong, JJ Kim, WJ Sul_


_Metagenome, Eukaryota, Microbiota, Algorithms, Metagenomics, Cluster Analysis_
Microbial genome recovery from metagenomes can further explain microbial ecosystem structures, functions and dynamics. Thus, this study developed the Additional Clustering Refiner (ACR) to enhance high-purity prokaryotic and eukaryotic metagenome-assembled genome (MAGs) recovery. ACR refines low-quality MAGs by subjecting them to iterative k-means clustering predicated on contig abundance and increasing bin purity through validated universal marker genes. Synthetic and real-world metagenomic datasets, including short- and long-read sequences, evaluated ACR's effectiveness. The results demonstrated improved MAG purity and a significant increase in high- and medium-quality MAG recovery rates. In addition, ACR seamlessly integrates with various binning algorithms, augmenting their strengths without modifying core features. Furthermore, its multiple sequencing technology compatibilities expand its applicability. By efficiently recovering high-quality prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, ACR is a promising tool for deepening our understanding of microbial communities through genome-centric metagenomics.

## Education and Training Adaptations for Health Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review of Lessons Learned and Innovations.
 14.11.2023, _P Boutros, N Kassem, J Nieder, C Jaramillo, J von Petersdorff, FJ Walsh, T Bärnighausen, S Barteit_


Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted the clinical education and training of health workers globally, causing severe disruptions to learning environments in healthcare facilities and limiting the acquisition of new clinical skills. Consequently, urgent adaptation measures, including simulation training and e-learning, have been implemented to mitigate the adverse effects of clinical education. This scoping review aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on medical education and training, examine the implemented adaptation measures, and evaluate their effectiveness in improving health workers' education and training during the pandemic. Methods: Employing the PRISMA-ScR framework and Arksey and O'Malley's methodological guidance, we conducted a scoping review, systematically searching PubMed, medRxiv, Google, and DuckDuckGo databases to account for the grey literature. The search included studies published between 1 December 2019 and 13 October 2021, yielding 10,323 results. Of these, 88 studies focused on health worker education and training during the pandemic. Results: Our review incorporated 31,268 participants, including physicians, medical trainees, nurses, paramedics, students, and health educators. Most studies (71/88, 81%) were conducted in high-income and lower-middle-income countries. The pandemic's effects on health workers' clinical skills and abilities have necessitated training period extensions in some cases. We identified several positive outcomes from the implementation of simulation training and e-learning as adaptation strategies, such as enhanced technical and clinical performance, increased confidence and comfort, and an expanded global educational outreach. Conclusions: Despite challenges like insufficient practical experience, limited interpersonal interaction opportunities, and internet connectivity issues, simulation training, e-learning, and virtual training have proven effective in improving clinical education and training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is required to bolster preparedness for future pandemics or similar situations.
