Several species of intestinal bacteria have been associated with enhanced efficacy of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms by which the microbiome enhances antitumor immunity are unclear. In this study, we isolated three bacterial species-Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Olsenella species-that significantly enhanced efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in four mouse models of cancer. We found that intestinal B. pseudolongum modulated enhanced immunotherapy response through production of the metabolite inosine. Decreased gut barrier function induced by immunotherapy increased systemic translocation of inosine and activated antitumor T cells. The effect of inosine was dependent on T cell expression of the adenosine A2A receptor and required costimulation. Collectively, our study identifies a previously unknown microbial metabolite immune pathway activated by immunotherapy that may be exploited to develop microbial-based adjuvant therapies.

## Vitamin D receptor promotes healthy microbial metabolites and microbiome.
 26.08.2020, _I Chatterjee, R Lu, Y Zhang, J Zhang, Y Dai, Y Xia, J Sun_


Microbiota derived metabolites act as chemical messengers that elicit a profound impact on host physiology. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a key genetic factor for shaping the host microbiome. However, it remains unclear how microbial metabolites are altered in the absence of VDR. We investigated metabolites from mice with tissue-specific deletion of VDR in intestinal epithelial cells or myeloid cells. Conditional VDR deletion severely changed metabolites specifically produced from carbohydrate, protein, lipid, and bile acid metabolism. Eighty-four out of 765 biochemicals were significantly altered due to the Vdr status, and 530 significant changes were due to the high-fat diet intervention. The impact of diet was more prominent due to loss of VDR as indicated by the differences in metabolites generated from energy expenditure, tri-carboxylic acid cycle, tocopherol, polyamine metabolism, and bile acids. The effect of HFD was more pronounced in female mice after VDR deletion. Interestingly, the expression levels of farnesoid X receptor in liver and intestine were significantly increased after intestinal epithelial VDR deletion and were further increased by the high-fat diet. Our study highlights the gender differences, tissue specificity, and potential gut-liver-microbiome axis mediated by VDR that might trigger downstream metabolic disorders.

## Longitudinal analysis of fecal microbiome and metabolome during renal fibrotic progression in a unilateral ureteral obstruction animal model.
 16.09.2020, _X Hu, Y Xie, Y Xiao, W Zeng, Z Gong, J Du_


Renal fibrosis is a major pathological process in the progression of various chronic kidney diseases to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Growing evidence has suggested that gut microbiota dysbiosis is closely related to ESRD. However, the interplay between altered fecal microbiome and metabolome during the renal fibrotic process remains unclear. Herein, an integrated approach of 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing combined with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics platform was applied to investigate the dynamic changes of fecal microbiota and metabolites throughout renal fibrosis progression in a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). The composition of gut microbiota changed markedly before and after UUO surgery. UUO mice showed a decrease in short-chain fatty acids-producing genera, including Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, Roseburia, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, as well as an increase in the genera Parasutterella and Alistipes, which changed dynamically over time. Additionally, 41 differential metabolites, mainly involved in 12 metabolic pathways, including inositol phosphate metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, purine metabolism, were identified in the UUO mice before and after surgery. Four fecal metabolites, myo-inositol, dodecanoic acid, N-acetylputrescine, and anthranilic acid, were positively associated with the progression of renal fibrosis. Moreover, by using multi-omics analyses, we found the alteration in UUO-related gut microbiota was correlated with a change in fecal metabolites. Therefore, our results provide insights into disturbances of the microbiome-metabolome interface in the progression of UUO-related renal fibrosis.

## Systematic review with meta-analysis: efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.

Increasing evidence supports the role of the gut microbiota in the aetiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment against recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and may be beneficial in ulcerative colitis. However, its efficacy in IBS is uncertain.
