Uropygial gland secretions of birds consist of host and bacteria derived compounds and play a major sanitary and feather-protective role. Here we report on our microbiome studies of the New Guinean toxic bird Pachycephala schlegelii and the isolation of a member of the Amycolatopsis genus from the uropygial gland secretions. Bioactivity studies in combination with co-cultures, MALDI imaging and HR-MS/MS-based network analyses unveil the basis of its activity against keratinolytic bacteria and fungal skin pathogens. We trace the protective antimicrobial activity of Amycolatopsis sp. PS_44_ISF1 to the production of rifamycin congeners, ciromicin A and of two yet unreported compound families. We perform NMR and HR-MS/MS studies to determine the relative structures of six members belonging to a yet unreported lipopeptide family of pachycephalamides and of one representative of the demiguisins, a new hexapeptide family. We then use a combination of phylogenomic, transcriptomic and knock-out studies to identify the underlying biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for the production of pachycephalamides and demiguisins. Our metabolomics data allow us to map molecular ion features of the identified metabolites in extracts of P. schlegelii feathers, verifying their presence in the ecological setting where they exert their presumed active role for hosts. Our study shows that members of the Actinomycetota may play a role in avian feather protection.

## Diversity and community distribution of soil bacterial in the Yellow River irrigation area of Ningxia, China.

The bacterial community performs an essential ecological role in maintaining agriculture systems. The roles of bacteria in the forest, marine, and agricultural systems have been studied extensively and intensively. However, similar studies in the areas irrigated by the Yellow River remain limited. In this study, we used Illumina sequencing analysis with the 16S rRNA method to analyze the bacterial diversity, community structure, and influencing factors in soil samples from eight regions of the Yellow River irrigation area in northwestern China. The bacterial community structure and diversity varied among samples from the eight regions. The samples differed significantly in terms of the bacterial community composition. Proteobacteria (approximately 12.4%-55.7%) accounted for the largest proportion and was the dominant bacteria, followed by Actinobacteria (approximately 9.2%-39.7%), Bacteroidetes (approximately 1.8%-21.5%), and Chloroflexi (approximately 2.7%-12.6%). Among the physicochemical variables, the soil pH in the eight regions was mildly alkaline, and the total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium contents in the soils differed significantly. However, the trend in the variations of the above variables was essentially similar. Soil bacteria in Yongning county had greater Chao1, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices than those in the other regions. Notably, soil moisture, organic matter, and total nitrogen were recognized as the primary factors influencing the bacterial community in the Yellow River irrigation area. Our results revealed the laws of variation in soil bacterial diversity and community composition in the Yellow River irrigation area. Our findings could be beneficial for maintaining sustainable ecological practices in the Yellow River irrigation area.

## Strain-resolved de-novo metagenomic assembly of viral genomes and microbial 16S rRNAs.

Metagenomics is a powerful approach to study environmental and human-associated microbial communities and, in particular, the role of viruses in shaping them. Viral genomes are challenging to assemble from metagenomic samples due to their genomic diversity caused by high mutation rates. In the standard de Bruijn graph assemblers, this genomic diversity leads to complex k-mer assembly graphs with a plethora of loops and bulges that are challenging to resolve into strains or haplotypes because variants more than the k-mer size apart cannot be phased. In contrast, overlap assemblers can phase variants as long as they are covered by a single read.
