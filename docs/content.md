This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Relationship between Facet Joint Tropism with Lumbar Disc Herniation at A Particular Motion Segment.
 10.01.2024, _S Shrestha, RB Lakhey, S Paudel, S Paudel_


Lumbar disc herniation is one of the important and common causes of low back pain. There are various modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for the development of lumbar disc herniation. Any change in the orientation or asymmetry of the facet joint i.e. facet tropism may lead to abnormal shearing stress on the intervertebral disc and may lead to development of disc herniation.

## Gut microbiome-derived butyrate inhibits the immunosuppressive factors PD-L1 and IL-10 in tumor-associated macrophages in gastric cancer.

Early detection and surgical treatment are essential to achieve a good outcome in gastric cancer (GC). Stage IV and recurrent GC have a poor prognosis. Therefore, new treatments for GC are needed. We investigated the intestinal microbiome of GC patients and attempted to reverse the immunosuppression of the immune and cancer cells of GC patients through the modulation of microbiome metabolites. We evaluated the levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and interleukin (IL)-10 in the peripheral blood immunocytes of GC patients. Cancer tissues were obtained from patients who underwent surgical resection of GC, and stained sections of cancer tissues were visualized via confocal microscopy. The intestinal microbiome was analyzed using stool samples of healthy individuals and GC patients. Patient-derived avatar model was developed by injecting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from advanced GC (AGC) patients into NSG mice, followed by injection of AGS cells. PD-L1 and IL-10 had higher expression levels in immune cells of GC patients than in those of healthy controls. The levels of immunosuppressive factors were increased in the immune and tumor cells of tumor tissues of GC patients. The abundances of Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium in the intestinal flora were lower in GC patients than in healthy individuals. Butyrate, a representative microbiome metabolite, suppressed the expression levels of PD-L1 and IL-10 in immune cells. In addition, the PBMCs of AGC patients showed increased levels of immunosuppressive factors in the avatar mouse model. Butyrate inhibited tumor growth in mice. Restoration of the intestinal microbiome and its metabolic functions inhibit tumor growth and reverse the immunosuppression due to increased PD-L1 and IL-10 levels in PBMCs and tumor cells of GC patients.

## Calcium-sensing receptor alleviates gut damage caused by endotoxemia by regulating gut microbiota.
 10.01.2024, _Y Sun, J Song, H Liu, L Li, K Xiao, W Mao, C Jiang_


Growing evidence points to an association between the gut microbiota and neonatal diseases. Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a major modulator of tissue responses associated with calcium homeostasis and is highly expressed in the mammalian gut. CaSR may affect the composition and balance of the intestinal microenvironment.

## BilR is a gut microbial enzyme that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen.

_Infant, Newborn, Adult, Humans, Bilirubin, Urobilinogen, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Liver, Bacteria_
Metabolism of haem by-products such as bilirubin by humans and their gut microbiota is essential to human health, as excess serum bilirubin can cause jaundice and even neurological damage. The bacterial enzymes that reduce bilirubin to urobilinogen, a key step in this pathway, have remained unidentified. Here we used biochemical analyses and comparative genomics to identify BilR as a gut-microbiota-derived bilirubin reductase that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen. We delineated the BilR sequences from similar reductases through the identification of key residues critical for bilirubin reduction and found that BilR is predominantly encoded by Firmicutes species. Analysis of human gut metagenomes revealed that BilR is nearly ubiquitous in healthy adults, but prevalence is decreased in neonates and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. This discovery sheds light on the role of the gut microbiome in bilirubin metabolism and highlights the significance of the gut-liver axis in maintaining bilirubin homeostasis.

Establishing the infant's gut microbiota has long-term implications on health and immunity. Breastfeeding is recognized as the best practice of infant nutrition in comparison with formula feeding. We evaluated the effects of the primary feeding practices by analyzing the infant growth and the potential association with gut diseases. A cross-sectional and observational study was designed. This study included 55 mothers with infants, who were divided according to their feeding practices in breastfeeding (BF), formula feeding (FF), and combined breast and formula feeding (CF). Anthropometric measurements of the participants were recorded. Additionally, non-invasive fecal samples from the infants were collected to analyze the microbiota by sequencing, immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration (ELISA), and volatile organic compounds (gas chromatography with an electronic nose). Results showed that the microbiota diversity in the BF group was the highest compared to the other two groups. The IgA levels in the BF group were twice as high as those in the FF group. Moreover, the child´s growth in the BF group showed the best infant development when the data were compared at birth to the recollection time, as noted by the correlation with a decreased concentration of toxic volatile organic compounds. Interestingly, the CF group showed a significant difference in health status when the data were compared with the FF group. We conclude that early health practices influence children's growth, which is relevant to further research about how those infants' health evolved.

Aquaculture plays an important role in global protein supplies and food security. The ban on antibiotics as feed additive proposes urgent need to develop alternatives. Gut microbiota plays important roles in the metabolism and immunity of fish and has the potential to give rise to novel solutions for challenges confronted by fish culture. However, our understanding of fish gut microbiome is still lacking.

The observation that the intestinal microbiota is central in the development of IBD suggests that dietary fiber, the microbiota's primary source of nourishment, could play a central role in these diseases. Accordingly, enriching diets with specific soluble fibers remodels microbiota and modulates colitis sensitivity. In humans, a recent study suggests that the microbiota of select IBD patients might influence the impacts they would experience upon fiber exposure. We sought here to define the extent to which individual microbiotas varied in their responsiveness to purified soluble fiber inulin and psyllium. Moreover, the extent to which such variance might impact proneness to colitis.

The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.

## Impact analysis of hydraulic residence time and dissolved oxygen on performance efficiency and microbial community in N, N-dimethylformamide wastewater treated by an AnSBR-ASBR.
 09.01.2024, _Y Wang, L Cao, Y Lu, J Liao, Y Lu, C Su, S Gao_


Suitable operating parameters are one of the key factors to efficient and stable biological wastewater treatment of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) wastewater. In this study, an improved AnSBR-ASBR reactor (anaerobic sequencing batch reactor, AnSBR, and aerobic SBR, ASBR, run in series) was used to investigated the effects of operating conditions such as hydraulic residence time (HRT), AnSBR stirring speed and ASBR dissolved oxygen (DO) for DMF wastewater treatment. When HRT decreased from 24 h to 12 h, the average removal rates of COD by the AnSBR were 34.59% and 39.54%, respectively. Meanwhile, the removal rate of NH4+-N by ASBR decreased from 88.38% to 62.81%. The DMF removal rate reached the best at 18 h and the expression of dehydrogenase was the highest in the AnSBR. The abundance of Megasphaera, the dominant sugar-degrading bacteria in the AnSBR, continued to decline due to the decrease of HRT. The relative abundance of Methanobacterium gradually increased to 80.2% with the decrease of HRT and that hydrotrophic methanogenesis dominated the methanogenic process. The HRT decrease promoted butyrate and pyruvate metabolism in anaerobic sludge, but the proportion of glycolysis and methane metabolism decreased. The AnSBR-ASBR reactor had the best operation performance when HRT was 18 h, AnSBR speed was 220 r/min, and ASBR DO content was 3-4 mg/L. This study provided an effective reference for the reasonable selection of operating parameters in the treatment of DMF-containing wastewater by the AnSBR-ASBR.

## Nutritional quality of the traditionally cooked Zamnè, a wild legume and a delicacy in Burkina Faso: assessment of the process effectiveness and the properties of cooking alkalis.
 10.01.2024, _MS Drabo, H Shumoy, B De Meulenaer, A Savadogo, K Raes_


Zamnè is a wild legume and a famine food that attracts interest for its health benefits and has become a delicacy in Burkina Faso. This study aimed to determine the nutritional quality of the traditionally cooked Zamnè, appreciate the effectiveness of the traditional cooking process, and compare the properties of the traditionally used cooking alkalis (i.e., potash or plant ash leachate and sodium bicarbonate). Yet, as shown, the traditional cooking of Zamnè is a very aggressive process that results in high disintegration of cell walls and membranes and leaching of most water-soluble constituents and nutrients (i.e., free amino acids, soluble nitrogen, sugars, soluble dietary fibers, and soluble phenolics). In addition, the extensive boiling and the cooking alkalis induced the sequestration of calcium, iron, magnesium, and zinc, significantly impairing their bioaccessibility. Despite the difference in the modus operandi of the cooking alkalis, there was no significant difference in the cooking outcomes. The traditionally cooked Zamnè presented high dietary protein (4.8 g), lipid (3.3 g), fiber (6.7-7.7 g), and metabolizable energy (63-65 kcal) contents (per 100 g fresh weight). Most antinutritional factors (i.e., non-protein nitrogen, tannins, and trypsin inhibitors) were eliminated. The proteins were relatively well preserved despite the aggressive alkaline processing. They demonstrated an appreciable digestibility (75%) and predicted PER (1.5) and a fairly balanced essential amino acid composition - which should completely meet the requirements for adults. The lipid content and composition were also well preserved and contained predominantly linoleic (C18:2n-6), oleic (C18:1c9), stearic (C18:0), and palmitic (C16:0) acids (33, 34, 10, and 15% total fatty acids, respectively). Overall, though extensive alkaline cooking seems a straightforward option to overcome the hard-to-cook problem of Zamnè, processing alternatives might be useful to reduce nutrient losses, improve the digestibility of the final product, and capture its full nutritional value.

Early detection and surgical treatment are essential to achieve a good outcome in gastric cancer (GC). Stage IV and recurrent GC have a poor prognosis. Therefore, new treatments for GC are needed. We investigated the intestinal microbiome of GC patients and attempted to reverse the immunosuppression of the immune and cancer cells of GC patients through the modulation of microbiome metabolites. We evaluated the levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and interleukin (IL)-10 in the peripheral blood immunocytes of GC patients. Cancer tissues were obtained from patients who underwent surgical resection of GC, and stained sections of cancer tissues were visualized via confocal microscopy. The intestinal microbiome was analyzed using stool samples of healthy individuals and GC patients. Patient-derived avatar model was developed by injecting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from advanced GC (AGC) patients into NSG mice, followed by injection of AGS cells. PD-L1 and IL-10 had higher expression levels in immune cells of GC patients than in those of healthy controls. The levels of immunosuppressive factors were increased in the immune and tumor cells of tumor tissues of GC patients. The abundances of Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium in the intestinal flora were lower in GC patients than in healthy individuals. Butyrate, a representative microbiome metabolite, suppressed the expression levels of PD-L1 and IL-10 in immune cells. In addition, the PBMCs of AGC patients showed increased levels of immunosuppressive factors in the avatar mouse model. Butyrate inhibited tumor growth in mice. Restoration of the intestinal microbiome and its metabolic functions inhibit tumor growth and reverse the immunosuppression due to increased PD-L1 and IL-10 levels in PBMCs and tumor cells of GC patients.

The rhizosheath, a cohesive soil layer firmly adhering to plant roots, plays a vital role in facilitating water and mineral uptake. In pearl millet, rhizosheath formation is genetically controlled and influenced by root exudates. Here, we investigated the impact of root exudates on the microbiota composition, interactions, and assembly processes, and rhizosheath structure in pearl millet using four distinct lines with contrasting soil aggregation abilities.

Metagenomics has enabled the comprehensive study of microbiomes. However, many applications would benefit from a method that sequences specific bacterial taxa of interest, but not most background taxa. We developed mEnrich-seq (in which 'm' stands for methylation and seq for sequencing) for enriching taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self versus nonself differentiation by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, individually or in combination, to deplete host and background taxa while enriching targeted taxa. This idea is integrated with library preparation procedures and applied in several applications to enrich (up to 117-fold) pathogenic or beneficial bacteria from human urine and fecal samples, including species that are hard to culture or of low abundance. We assessed 4,601 bacterial strains with mapped methylomes so far and showed broad applicability of mEnrich-seq. mEnrich-seq provides microbiome researchers with a versatile and cost-effective approach for selective sequencing of diverse taxa of interest.

Diverse host factors drive microbial variation in plant-associated environments, whereas their genetic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. To address this, we coupled the analyses of plant genetics and microbiomes in this study. Using 100 tea plant (Camellia sinensis) cultivars, the microbiomes of rhizosphere, root endosphere and phyllosphere showed clear compartment-specific assembly, whereas the subpopulation differentiation of tea cultivars exhibited small effects on microbial variation in each compartment. Through microbiome genome-wide association studies, we examined the interactions between tea genetic loci and microbial variation. Notably, genes related to the cell wall and carbon catabolism were heavily linked to root endosphere microbial composition, whereas genes related to the metabolism of metal ions and small organic molecules were overrepresented in association with rhizosphere microbial composition. Moreover, a set of tea genetic variants, including the cytoskeleton-related formin homology interacting protein 1 gene, were strongly associated with the β-diversity of phyllosphere microbiomes, implying their interactions with the overall structure of microbial communities. Our results create a catalogue of tea genetic determinants interacting with microbiomes and reveal the compartment-specific microbiome assembly driven by host genetics.

## Short-Term Outcomes of COVID-19 Pandemic on Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Screening and Management.
 10.01.2024, _F Orelaru, M Edwards, R Raleigh, A Abunayla, R Bush, S Porter, K Schumaker, J Albright, KN Adams_


Background To assess the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) screening, staging, and management in a single health care system. Materials and Methods From November 2015 to December 2020, a total of 1,547 NSCLC cases was reported at our institution including 1,329 cases pre-COVID-19 and 218 cases during COVID-19. Pre-COVID-19 was defined as November 2015 to February 2020, while during COVID-19 was March 2020 to December 2020. Data were collected from tumor registry and medical record review. Patients with mesothelioma, lymphoma, small cell, or mixed small cell cancer were excluded from the study. Results Both pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 cohorts had similar comorbidities including age (70 vs. 71 years), current smokers (35 vs. 32%), and chronic obstructive lung disease (32 vs. 28%). The number of low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening scans decreased by 25% during COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 era. There were more cases of stage 1A NSCLC pre-COVID-19 (31 vs. 25%) and more stage 4 cancer during COVID-19 (42 vs. 33%); p = 0.01. The proportion of patients treated with radiotherapy was similar between pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 (49 vs. 50%), but fewer patients underwent surgery during COVID-19 (17 vs. 27%; p = 0.004). The median time to radiotherapy (67 days) and surgery (29 days) was similar between the groups. The unadjusted overall 6-month mortality after lung cancer diagnoses was higher during COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 (28 vs. 22%; p = 0.04). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in delayed lung cancer screening scans, and more patients had diagnosis of advanced NSCLC; however, short-term mortality was unchanged.
