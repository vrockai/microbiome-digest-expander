## Differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome based on metagenomic analysis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
 16.07.2021, _H Fan, X Hong, J Zeng, X Wang, J Chen_


Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common cause of infertility and shows a high incidence in women of reproductive age. Acupuncture is an appropriate adjunctive treatment for PCOS. However, the add-on effect of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for obese women with PCOS has not been studied, and previous studies indicate that there are individual differences in the curative effect of acupuncture, while deeper research on the mechanism of differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS is still lacking. This trial aims to assess the add-on treatment efficacy of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS and to explore the role of the gut microbiome on the differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture based on metagenomic analysis.

Although recent studies have indicated that intestinal microbiota dweller are involved in the pathogenesis of allergy rhinitis (AR), the influence of gut microbiota on AR adult has not been fully elucidated yet. Hence, we carried out this study to uncover the distinctive bacterial taxa that differentiate allergy rhinitis patients from healthy individuals. Feces samples from thirty three AR patients and thirty one healthy individuals were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

## Chlortetracycline alters microbiota of gut or faeces in pigs and leads to accumulation and migration of antibiotic resistance genes.
 17.07.2021, _X Ma, Z Yang, T Xu, M Qian, X Jiang, X Zhan, X Han_


In this study, we investigated the effect of long-term use of chlortetracycline (CTC) on the gut microbiota composition and metabolism profiles in pigs, and the variation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities in faeces and manure during aerobic composting (AC) and anaerobic digestion (AD). The pigs were fed the same basal diet supplemented with or without 75 mg/kg CTC, and fresh faeces of 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-day-old pigs were collected from the CTC group. The results showed that CTC reduced the diversity of the gut microbiota significantly and changed its structure. Metabolomics analysis of intestinal contents revealed 23 differentially abundant metabolites, mainly organic acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Metabolic pathways, such as the TCA cycle, propionate metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism, were changed. From 30 to 120 days of age, the amount of CTC residues in faeces and the abundance of 3 tetracycline resistance genes increased significantly, and it was positively correlated with tetC, tetG, tetW, sul1 and intI2. CTC residue levels and ARGs abundance gradually decreased with fermentation time, and AC was better than AD at reducing ARGs abundance. The results suggest that in-feed CTC can reduce the diversity of the gut microbiota, change the structure, function and metabolism of the bacterial community, and increase the abundance of ARGs in faeces.

## Identification of pathogen(s) in infectious diseases using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and conventional culture: a comparative study.
 13.07.2021, _H Chen, J Li, S Yan, H Sun, C Tan, M Liu, K Liu, H Zhang, M Zou, X Xiao_


Early and accurate diagnosis of microorganism(s) is important to optimize antimicrobial therapy. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing technology, an unbiased and comprehensive method for pathogen identification, seems to potentially assist or even replace conventional microbiological methodology in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. However, evidence in clinical application of this platform is relatively limited.

## Predicting antibiotic resistance gene abundance in activated sludge using shotgun metagenomics and machine learning.
 15.07.2021, _Y Sun, B Clarke, J Clarke, X Li_


While the microbiome of activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) plays a vital role in shaping the resistome, identifying the potential bacterial hosts of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in WWTPs remains challenging. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using a machine learning approach, random forests (RF's), to identify the strength of associations between ARGs and bacterial taxa in metagenomic datasets from the activated sludge of WWTPs. Our results show that the abundance of select ARGs can be predicted by RF's using abundant genera (Candidatus Accumulibacter, Dechloromonas, Pesudomonas, and Thauera, etc.), (opportunistic) pathogens and indicators (Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Streptococcus, etc.), and nitrifiers (Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira, etc.) as explanatory variables. The correlations between predicted and observed abundance of ARGs (erm(B), tet(O), tet(Q), etc.) ranged from medium (0.400 &lt; R2 &lt; 0.600) to strong (R2 &gt; 0.600) when validated on testing datasets. Compared to those belonging to the other two groups, individual genera in the group of (opportunistic) pathogens and indicator bacteria had more positive functional relationships with select ARGs, suggesting genera in this group (e.g., Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Streptococcus) may be hosts of select ARGs. Furthermore, RF's with (opportunistic) pathogens and indicators as explanatory variables were used to predict the abundance of select ARGs in a full-scale WWTP successfully. Machine learning approaches such as RF's can potentially identify bacterial hosts of ARGs and reveal possible functional relationships between the ARGs and microbial community in the AS of WWTPs.

## Assessing the relationship between the rumen microbiota and feed efficiency in Nellore steers.
 15.07.2021, _DRG Lopes, M de Souza Duarte, AJ La Reau, IZ Chaves, TA de Oliveira Mendes, E Detmann, CBP Bento, MEZ Mercadante, SFM Bonilha, G Suen, HC Mantovani_


Ruminants rely upon a complex community of microbes in their rumen to convert host-indigestible feed into nutrients. However, little is known about the association between the rumen microbiota and feed efficiency traits in Nellore (Bos indicus) cattle, a breed of major economic importance to the global beef market. Here, we compare the composition of the bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the rumen of Nellore steers with high and low feed efficiency (FE) phenotypes, as measured by residual feed intake (RFI).

Computational methods are key in microbiome research, and obtaining a quantitative and unbiased performance estimate is important for method developers and applied researchers. For meaningful comparisons between methods, to identify best practices and common use cases, and to reduce overhead in benchmarking, it is necessary to have standardized datasets, procedures and metrics for evaluation. In this tutorial, we describe emerging standards in computational meta-omics benchmarking derived and agreed upon by a larger community of researchers. Specifically, we outline recent efforts by the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) initiative, which supplies method developers and applied researchers with exhaustive quantitative data about software performance in realistic scenarios and organizes community-driven benchmarking challenges. We explain the most relevant evaluation metrics for assessing metagenome assembly, binning and profiling results, and provide step-by-step instructions on how to generate them. The instructions use simulated mouse gut metagenome data released in preparation for the second round of CAMI challenges and showcase the use of a repository of tool results for CAMI datasets. This tutorial will serve as a reference for the community and facilitate informative and reproducible benchmarking in microbiome research.

The ocean microbiota modulates global biogeochemical cycles and changes in its configuration may have large-scale consequences. Yet, the underlying ecological mechanisms structuring it are unclear. Here, we investigate how fundamental ecological mechanisms (selection, dispersal and ecological drift) shape the smallest members of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota: prokaryotes and minute eukaryotes (picoeukaryotes). Furthermore, we investigate the agents exerting abiotic selection on this assemblage as well as the spatial patterns emerging from the action of ecological mechanisms. To explore this, we analysed the composition of surface-ocean prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities using DNA-sequence data (16S- and 18S-rRNA genes) collected during the circumglobal expeditions Malaspina-2010 and TARA-Oceans.
