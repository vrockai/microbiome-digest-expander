## The pangenome analysis of the environmental source Salmonella enterica highlights a diverse accessory genome and a distinct serotype clustering.
 12.11.2024, _JR Aguirre-Sánchez, C Chaidez, N Castro-Del Campo_


Salmonella remains the leading cause of foodborne infections globally. Environmental reservoirs, particularly aquatic bodies, serve as conduits for the fecal-oral transmission of this pathogen. While the gastrointestinal tract is traditionally considered the primary habitat of Salmonella, mounting evidence suggests the bacterium's capacity for survival in external environments. The application of advanced technological platforms, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), facilitates a comprehensive analysis of Salmonella's genomic features. This study aims to characterize the genomic composition of Salmonella isolates from river water, contributing to a potential paradigm shift and advancing public health protection. A total of 25 river water samples were collected and processed, followed by microbiological isolation of Salmonella strains, which were then sequenced. Genomic characterization revealed adaptive mechanisms, including gene duplication. Furthermore, an open pangenome, predisposed to incorporating foreign genetic material, was identified. Notably, antibiotic resistance genes were found to be part of the core genome, challenging previous reports that placed them in the accessory genome.

## Urea assimilation and oxidation support activity of phylogenetically diverse microbial communities of the dark ocean.
 12.11.2024, _N Arandia-Gorostidi, AL Jaffe, AE Parada, BJ Kapili, KL Casciotti, RSR Salcedo, CMJ Baumas, AE Dekas_


Urea is hypothesized to be an important source of nitrogen and chemical energy to microorganisms in the deep sea; however, direct evidence for urea use below the epipelagic ocean is lacking. Here, we explore urea utilization from 50 to 4000 meters depth in the northeastern Pacific Ocean using metagenomics, nitrification rates, and single-cell stable-isotope-uptake measurements with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry. We find that on average 25% of deep-sea cells assimilated urea-derived N (60% of detectably active cells), and that cell-specific nitrogen-incorporation rates from urea were higher than that from ammonium. Both urea concentrations and assimilation rates relative to ammonium generally increased below the euphotic zone. We detected ammonia- and urea-based nitrification at all depths at one of two sites analyzed, demonstrating their potential to support chemoautotrophy in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic regions. Using newly generated metagenomes we find that the ureC gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of urease, is found within 39% of deep-sea cells in this region, including the Nitrososphaeria (syn., Thaumarchaeota; likely for nitrification) as well as members of thirteen other phyla such as Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Plantomycetota, Nitrospinota, and Chloroflexota (likely for assimilation). Analysis of public metagenomes estimated ureC within 10-46% of deep-sea cells around the world, with higher prevalence below the photic zone, suggesting urea is widely available to the deep-sea microbiome globally. Our results demonstrate that urea is a nitrogen source to abundant and diverse microorganisms in the dark ocean, as well as a significant contributor to deep-sea nitrification and therefore fuel for chemoautotrophy.

## Expression of the polyphenol oxidase gene MdPPO7 is modulated by MdWRKY3 to regulate browning in sliced apple fruit.
 13.11.2024, _H Zou, C Li, X Wei, Q Xiao, X Tian, L Zhu, B Ma, F Ma, M Li_


Browning is a pervasive problem in horticultural products, substantially diminishing the appearance, flavor and nutritional value of fruit, including important fruits like apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.). In this study, we compared the physiological characteristics of the browning-resistant line 'Rb-18' with the susceptible variety 'Fuji' and found that the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme activity and phenolic content of Rb-18 were significantly lower than those in Fuji. In addition, the PPO enzyme in Fuji showed a stronger affinity for its substrate, catechol, compared to Rb-18. Through transcriptome and RT-qPCR analyses, MdPPO7 expression was identified as contributing to flesh browning after cutting. Subsequent fruit injection and stable genetic transformation of the MdPPO7 gene into apple fruit and calli determined that syringic acid, procyanidin, phloridzin, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, catechin, and caffeic act as its catalytic substrates in the process involved in browning. Furthermore, luciferase reporter, yeast one-hybrid, β-glucuronidase reporter assays and chip-qPCR analysis demonstrated that a WRKY transcription factor(MdWRKY3) binds to the promoter region of polyphenol oxidase gene (MdPPO7) and positively regulates its expression to promote apple flesh browning. This study provides insights into the molecular regulatory mechanisms of fruit browning in fresh-cut apples and provides a theoretical basis for the generation of high-quality apple germplasm resources.

## Predictable regulation of gut microbiome in immunotherapeutic efficacy of gastric cancer.
 12.11.2024, _W Gao, X Wang, Y Shi, G Wu, M Zhou, X Lin_


Immunotherapy has showcased remarkable progress in the management of gastric cancer (GC), prompting the need to proactively identify and classify patients suitable for immunotherapy. Here, 30 patients were enrolled and stratified into three groups (PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; PD, progressive disease) based on efficacy assessment. 16S rRNA sequencing were performed to analyze the gut microbiome signature of patients at three timepoints. We found that immunotherapy interventions perturbed the gut microbiota of patients. Additionally, although differences at the enterotype level did not distinguish patients' immunotherapy response, we identified 6, 7, and 19 species that were significantly enriched in PR, SD, and PD, respectively. Functional analysis showed that betalain biosynthesis and indole alkaloid biosynthesis were significantly different between the responders and non-responders. Furthermore, machine learning model utilizing only bacterial biomarkers accurately predicted immunotherapy efficacy with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.941. Notably, Akkermansia muciniphila and Dorea formicigenerans played a significant role in the classification of immunotherapy efficacy. In conclusion, our study reveals that gut microbiome signatures can be utilized as effective biomarkers for predicting the immunotherapy efficacy for GC.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is one of the most efficient therapeutic options available to cure many hematological malignancies. However, severe complications derived from this procedure, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and infections, can limit its success and negatively impact survival. Previous studies have shown that alterations in the microbiome are associated with the development of allo-HSCT-derived complications. However, most studies relied on single techniques that can only analyze a unique aspect of the microbiome, which hinders our ability to understand how microbiome alterations drive allo-HSCT-associated diseases.

## Viral infection and antiviral immunity in the oral cavity.
 12.11.2024, _HD Hickman, NM Moutsopoulos_


Individual tissues have distinct antiviral properties garnered through various mechanisms, including physical characteristics, tissue-resident immune cells and commensal organisms. Although the oral mucosa has long been appreciated as a critical barrier tissue that is exposed to a continuous barrage of pathogens, many fundamental aspects of the antiviral immune response in this tissue remain unknown. Several viral pathogens, such as herpesviruses and human papillomaviruses, have been acknowledged both historically and at present for infections in the oral cavity that result in substantial clinical burden. However, recent viral outbreaks, including those with SARS-CoV-2 and mpox, featured oral symptoms even though these viruses are not generally considered oral pathogens. Ensuing studies have shown that the oral cavity is an important locale for viral infection and potential transmission of newly emergent or re-emergent pathogens, highlighting the need for an increased understanding of the mechanisms of antiviral immunity at this site. In this Review, we provide a broad overview of antiviral immune responses in the oral cavity and discuss common viral infections and their manifestations in the oral mucosa. In addition, we present current mouse models for the study of oral viral infections.

Lifestyle plays an important role in shaping the gut microbiome. However, its contributions to the oral microbiome remain less clear, due to the confounding effects of geography and methodology in investigations of populations studied to date. Furthermore, while the oral microbiome seems to differ between foraging and industrialized populations, we lack insight into whether transitions to and away from agrarian lifestyles shape the oral microbiota. Given the growing interest in so-called "vanishing microbiomes" potentially being a risk factor for increased disease prevalence in industrialized populations, it is important that we distinguish lifestyle from geography in the study of microbiomes across populations.

Patients with COVID-19 under invasive mechanical ventilation are at higher risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), associated with increased healthcare costs, and unfavorable prognosis. The underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly dissected. Therefore, this study attempted to bridge this gap by performing a lung microbiota analysis and evaluating the host immune responses that could drive the development of VAP. In this prospective cohort study, mechanically ventilated patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Nasal swabs (NS), endotracheal aspirates (ETA), and blood samples were collected initially within 12 h of intubation and again at 72 h post-intubation. Plasma samples underwent cytokine and metabolomic analyses, while NS and ETA samples were sequenced for lung microbiome examination. The cohort was categorized based on the development of VAP. Data analysis was conducted using RStudio version 4.3.1. In a study of 36 COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation, significant differences were found in the nasal and pulmonary microbiome, notably in Staphylococcus and Enterobacteriaceae, linked to VAP. Patients with VAP showed a higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory samples, elevated neutralizing antibodies, and reduced inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-δ, IL-1β, IL-12p70, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α, and CCL4. Metabolomic analysis revealed changes in 22 metabolites in non-VAP patients and 27 in VAP patients, highlighting D-Maltose-Lactose, Histidinyl-Glycine, and various phosphatidylcholines, indicating a metabolic predisposition to VAP. This study reveals a critical link between respiratory microbiome alterations and ventilator-associated pneumonia in COVID-19 patients with higher SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in respiratory samples, elevated neutralizing antibodies, and reduced inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-δ, IL-1β, IL-12p70, IL-18, IL-6, TNF-α, and CCL4. These findings provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of VAP, with potential implications for management and prevention.

Skin microbiota plays an essential role in the development and function of the cutaneous immune system, in the maintenance of the skin barrier through the release of antimicrobial peptides, and in the metabolism of some natural products. With the aim of characterizing changes in the cutaneous microbiota specifically associated with wound healing in the diabetic condition, we performed a 16 S rRNA gene Next Generation Sequencing of skin swabs taken within the ulcer bed of ten diabetic patients before (t0) and after 20 days of therapy (t20) with a fluorescein-based galenic treatment. Considering the twenty most representative genera, we found at t20 an increase of Corynebacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Streptococcus, and a decrease of Enterococcus, Finegoldia, and Peptoniphilus genera. However, differences were not significant due to the high variability among samples and the small patient cohort. S. aureus was the most abundant species at t0 and was reduced by therapy in four patients. Comparing the microbiome in the ulcer bed and in the perilesional tissue of the same patient at t0, no major differences were observed. Taken together, our data indicate that in the absence of antibiotic-based therapy the healing process of diabetic ulcers is accompanied by changes in the microbiome composition.

The impact of microplastics on antibiotic resistance has attracted widespread attention. However, previous studies primarily focused on the effects of individual microplastics. In reality, diverse microplastic types accumulate in soil, and it remains less well studied whether microplastic diversity (i.e., variations in color, shape or polymer type) can be an important driver of increased antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) abundance. Here, we employed microcosm studies to investigate the effects of microplastic diversity on soil ARG dynamics through metagenomic analysis. Additionally, we evaluated the associated potential health risks by profiling virulence factor genes (VFGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Our findings reveal that as microplastic diversity increases, there is a corresponding rise in the abundance of soil ARGs, VFGs and MGEs. We further identified microbial adaptive strategies involving genes (changed genetic diversity), community (increased specific microbes), and functions (enriched metabolic pathways) that correlate with increased ARG abundance and may thus contribute to ARG dissemination. Additional global change factors, including fungicide application and plant diversity reduction, also contributed to elevated ARG abundance. Our findings suggest that, in addition to considering contamination levels, it is crucial to monitor microplastic diversity in ecosystems due to their potential role in driving the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through multiple pathways.

Increased risk of asthma and other respiratory diseases is associated with exposures to microbial communities growing in damp and moldy indoor environments. The exact causal mechanisms remain unknown, and occupant health effects have not been consistently associated with any species-based mold measurement methods. We need new quantitative methods to identify homes with potentially harmful fungal growth that are not dependent upon species. The goal of this study was to identify genes consistently associated with fungal growth and associated function under damp conditions for use as potential indicators of mold in homes regardless of fungal species present. A de novo metatranscriptomic analysis was performed using house dust from across the US, incubated at 50%, 85%, or 100% equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) for 1 week.

Heat stress (HS) commonly occurring in summer has gradually become a factor threatening the reproductive performance of male dairy goats by reducing their fecundity. Despite the melatonin is applied to relieve HS, it is still unclear whether melatonin protects against reproductive damage induced by HS in dairy goats and how it works. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the role of melatonin in alleviating HS-induced spermatogenesis dysfunction in male dairy goats and further explore its mechanism.

## Pathobiont and symbiont contribute to microbiota homeostasis through Malpighian tubules-gut countercurrent flow in Bactrocera dorsalis.
 12.11.2024, _Y Liu, R Luo, S Bai, B Lemaitre, H Zhang, X Li_


Host-gut microbiota interactions are more complex than good or bad. Both gut symbiotic bacteria and pathobionts can provide essential functions to their host in one scenario and yet be detrimental to host health in another. So, these gut-dwelling bacteria must be tightly controlled to avoid harmful effects on the host. However, how pathobionts and other symbiotic bacteria coordinate to establish a host immune defense system remains unclear. Here, using a Tephritidae fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis, we report that both pathobionts and other gut symbiotic bacteria release tyramine, which is recognized by the host insects. These tyramines induce the formation of insect-conserved Malpighian tubules-gut countercurrent flow upon bacterial infection, which requires tyramine receptors and aquaporins. At the same time, pathobionts but not gut symbiotic bacteria induce the generation of reactive oxygen species, which are preserved by the countercurrent flow, promoting bacteria elimination through increasing gut peristalsis. More importantly, our results show that the Malpighian tubules-gut countercurrent flow maintains proper microbiota composition. Our work suggests a model where pathobiont-induced reactive oxygen species are preserved by Malpighian tubules-gut countercurrent flow involving both pathobionts and symbiotic bacteria. Furthermore, our work provides a Malpighian tubules-gut interaction that ensures efficient maintenance of the gut microbiota.

As a feed additive, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs)/medium-chain fatty acid triglycerides (MCTs) have been used in ruminant production, but mostly added in the form of mixed esters. Studies have shown that MCTs may have a positive effect on feed intake or oxidative stress in animals, but it is unclear which MCT could play a role, and the mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, the effects of individual MCT on growth performance, serum intake-related hormones, and oxidative stress indices in finishing bulls were investigated and further studied the effects of MCT supplementation on gastrointestinal tract bacteria and rumen fluid metabolomics.

## Latitudinal gradients and ocean fronts strongly influence protist communities in the southern Pacific Ocean.
 11.11.2024, _D Sturm, P Morton, G Langer, WM Balch, G Wheeler_


Protist communities in the southern Pacific Ocean make a major contribution to global biogeochemical cycling, but remain understudied due to their remote location. We therefore have limited understanding of how large-scale physical gradients (e.g. temperature) and mesoscale oceanographic features (e.g. fronts) influence microeukaryote diversity in this region. We performed a high-resolution examination of protist communities along a latitudinal transect (&gt;3000 km) at 150°W in the central southern Pacific Ocean that encompassed major frontal regions, including the sub-tropical front (STF), the sub-Antarctic front (SAF), and the polar front (PF). We identified distinct microbial communities along the transect that were primarily delineated by the positions of the STF and PF. Some taxa were not constricted by these environmental boundaries and were able to span frontal regions, such as the colonial haptophyte Phaeocystis. Our findings also support the presence of a Latitudinal Diversity Gradient (LDG) of decreasing diversity of the protist community with increasing latitude, although some individual taxa, notably the diatoms, do not adhere to this rule. Our findings show that oceanographic features and large-scale physical gradients have important impacts on marine protist communities in the southern Pacific Ocean that are likely to strongly influence their response to future environmental change.

## MAGqual: a stand-alone pipeline to assess the quality of metagenome-assembled genomes.
 06.11.2024, _A Cansdale, JPJ Chong_


_Metagenomics, Metagenome, Software, Microbiota, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Bacteria, Humans_
Metagenomics, the whole genome sequencing of microbial communities, has provided insight into complex ecosystems. It has facilitated the discovery of novel microorganisms, explained community interactions and found applications in various fields. Advances in high-throughput and third-generation sequencing technologies have further fuelled its popularity. Nevertheless, managing the vast data produced and addressing variable dataset quality remain ongoing challenges. Another challenge arises from the number of assembly and binning strategies used across studies. Comparing datasets and analysis tools is complex as it requires the quantitative assessment of metagenome quality. The inherent limitations of metagenomic sequencing, which often involves sequencing complex communities, mean community members are challenging to interrogate with traditional culturing methods leading to many lacking reference sequences. MIMAG standards aim to provide a method to assess metagenome quality for comparison but have not been widely adopted.
