 03.07.2021, _X Zhu, B Li, P Lou, T Dai, Y Chen, A Zhuge, Y Yuan, L Li_


Many recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome plays important roles in human physiology and pathology. Also, microbiome-based therapies have been used to improve health status and treat diseases. In addition, aging and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, have become topics of intense interest in biomedical research. Several researchers have explored the links between these topics to study the potential pathogenic or therapeutic effects of intestinal microbiota in disease. But the exact relationship between neurodegenerative diseases and gut microbiota remains unclear. As technology advances, new techniques for studying the microbiome will be developed and refined, and the relationship between diseases and gut microbiota will be revealed. This article summarizes the known interactions between the gut microbiome and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting assay techniques for the gut microbiome, and we also discuss the potential therapeutic role of microbiome-based therapies in diseases.

Giving the potential contribute in cancer initiation and progression, lung microbiota represents a promising topic in cancer research, although still unexplored. We performed a systematic literature search to identify clinical studies evaluating lung microbiota composition, its correlation with lung cancer patients' clinico-pathological features and prognosis. Of the identified 370 studies, 21 were eligible and included. Although studies were heterogeneous, lung cancer resulted to be enriched in peculiar microbial communities, with differences in composition and diversity according to clinico-pathological parameters. Few studies explored how lung microbiota influences cancer outcome. In light of these findings and borrowing the suggestions coming from gut microbiota, we speculate that respiratory microbiome may influence pathogenesis, progression and outcome of lung cancer. Taking advantage of the experience of chronical lung diseases, prospective studies should be designed to evaluate lung microbiota changes throughout any phase of lung cancer course, particularly with the advent of immunotherapy as pivotal treatment.

## Commensal microbiota regulates skin barrier function and repair via signaling through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.

The epidermis forms a barrier that defends the body from desiccation and entry of harmful substances, while also sensing and integrating environmental signals. The tightly orchestrated cellular changes needed for the formation and maintenance of this epidermal barrier occur in the context of the skin microbiome. Using germ-free mice, we demonstrate the microbiota is necessary for proper differentiation and repair of the epidermal barrier. These effects are mediated by microbiota signaling through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in keratinocytes, a xenobiotic receptor also implicated in epidermal differentiation. Mice lacking keratinocyte AHR are more susceptible to barrier damage and infection, during steady-state and epicutaneous sensitization. Colonization with a defined consortium of human skin isolates restored barrier competence in an AHR-dependent manner. We reveal a fundamental mechanism whereby the microbiota regulates skin barrier formation and repair, which has far-reaching implications for the numerous skin disorders characterized by epidermal barrier dysfunction.

## Tryptophan-metabolizing gut microbes regulate adult neurogenesis via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.

While modulatory effects of gut microbes on neurological phenotypes have been reported, the mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that indole, a tryptophan metabolite produced by tryptophanase-expressing gut microbes, elicits neurogenic effects in the adult mouse hippocampus. Neurogenesis is reduced in germ-free (GF) mice and in GF mice monocolonized with a single-gene tnaA knockout (KO) mutant Escherichia coli unable to produce indole. External administration of systemic indole increases adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus in these mouse models and in specific pathogen-free (SPF) control mice. Indole-treated mice display elevated synaptic markers postsynaptic density protein 95 and synaptophysin, suggesting synaptic maturation effects in vivo. By contrast, neurogenesis is not induced by indole in aryl hydrocarbon receptor KO (AhR-/-) mice or in ex vivo neurospheres derived from them. Neural progenitor cells exposed to indole exit the cell cycle, terminally differentiate, and mature into neurons that display longer and more branched neurites. These effects are not observed with kynurenine, another AhR ligand. The indole-AhR-mediated signaling pathway elevated the expression of β-catenin, Neurog2, and VEGF-α genes, thus identifying a molecular pathway connecting gut microbiota composition and their metabolic function to neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. Our data have implications for the understanding of mechanisms of brain aging and for potential next-generation therapeutic opportunities.

## Mucosa-associated gut microbiota reflects clinical course of ulcerative colitis.
 05.07.2021, _Y Nishihara, H Ogino, M Tanaka, E Ihara, K Fukaura, K Nishioka, T Chinen, Y Tanaka, J Nakayama, D Kang, Y Ogawa_


This longitudinal study was designed to elucidate whether gut microbiota is associated with relapse and treatment response in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Fifty-one patients with UC were enrolled between 2012 and 2017, and followed up through 2020. Colon mucosal biopsy were obtained at enrollment, and 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing was performed using extracted RNA. Of the 51 patients, 24 were in remission and 27 had active UC at enrollment. Of the 24 patients in remission, 17 maintained remission and 7 developed relapse during follow-up. The 7 patients with relapse showed lower diversity, with a lower proportion of Clostridiales (p = 0.0043), and a higher proportion of Bacteroides (p = 0.047) at enrollment than those without relapse. The 27 patients with active UC were classified into response (n = 6), refractory (n = 13), and non-response (n = 8) groups according to their treatment response in 6 months. The refractory and non-response groups showed lower diversity with a lower proportion of Prevotella (p = 0.048 and 0.043) at enrollment than the response group. This study is the first demonstration that reduced diversity and particular microbes are associated with the later clinical course of relapse events and treatment response in UC.

## The Gut Microbiome of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.
 02.07.2021, _AL Beale, JA O'Donnell, ME Nakai, S Nanayakkara, D Vizi, K Carter, E Dean, RV Ribeiro, S Yiallourou, MJ Carrington, FZ Marques, DM Kaye_


Background Risk factors for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) include hypertension, age, sex, and obesity. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota independently contributes to each one of these risk factors, potentially mediated via gut microbial-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids. In this study, we determined whether the gut microbiota were associated with HFpEF and its risk factors. Methods and Results We recruited 26 patients with HFpEF and 67 control participants from 2 independent communities. Patients with HFpEF were diagnosed by exercise right heart catheterization. We assessed the gut microbiome by bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and food intake by the food frequency questionnaire. There was a significant difference in α-diversity (eg, number of microbes) and β-diversity (eg, type and abundance of microbes) between both cohorts of controls and patients with HFpEF (P=0.001). We did not find an association between β-diversity and specific demographic or hemodynamic parameters or risk factors for HFpEF. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, a commonly used marker of gut dysbiosis, was lower, but not significantly so (P=0.093), in the patients with HFpEF. Compared with controls, the gut microbiome of patients with HFpEF was depleted of bacteria that are short-chain fatty acid producers. Consistent with this, participants with HFpEF consumed less dietary fiber (17.6±7.7 versus 23.2±8.8 g/day; P=0.016). Conclusions We demonstrate key changes in the gut microbiota in patients with HFpEF, including the depletion of bacteria that generate metabolites known to be important for cardiovascular homeostasis. Further studies are required to validate the role of these gut microbiota and metabolites in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.

## Association of gut microbiomes with lung and esophageal cancer: a pilot study.
 02.07.2021, _W Shen, D Tang, Y Deng, H Li, T Wang, P Wan, R Liu_


Gut microbiota, especially human pathogens, has been shown to be involved in the occurrence and development of cancer. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and lung cancer are two malignant cancers, and their relationship with gut microbiota is still unclear. Virulence factor database (VFDB) is an integrated and comprehensive online resource for curating information about human pathogens. Here, based on VFDB database, we analyzed the differences of bacteria at genus level in the gut of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and healthy controls. We proposed the possible cancer-associated bacteria in gut and put forward their possible effects. Apart from this, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and analysis of similarities (ANSOIM) suggested that some bacteria in the gut can be used as potential biomarkers to screen esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and lung cancer, and their effectiveness was preliminary verified. The relative abundance of Klebsiella and Streptococcus can be used to distinguish patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and lung cancer from healthy controls. The absolute abundance of Klebsiella can further distinguish patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from patients with lung cancer. In particular, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium can directly distinguish between patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and healthy controls. Additionally, the absolute abundance of Haemophilus can distinguish lung cancer from healthy controls. Our study provided a new way based on VFDB database to explore the relationship between gut microbiota and cancer, and initially proposed a feasible cancer screening method.

## Vaginal Lactobacilli and Vaginal Dysbiosis-Associated Bacteria Differently Affect Cervical Epithelial and Immune Homeostasis and Anti-Viral Defenses.

Persistent infection with High Risk-Human Papilloma Viruses (HR-HPVs) is a primary cause of cervical cancer worldwide. Vaginal-dysbiosis-associated bacteria were correlated with the persistence of HR-HPVs infection and with increased cancer risk. We obtained strains of the most represented bacterial species in vaginal microbiota and evaluated their effects on the survival of cervical epithelial cells and immune homeostasis. The contribution of each species to supporting the antiviral response was also studied. Epithelial cell viability was affected by culture supernatants of most vaginal-dysbiosis bacteria, whereas Lactobacillus gasseri or Lactobacillus jensenii resulted in the best stimulus to induce interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production by human mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PBMCs). Although vaginal-dysbiosis-associated bacteria induced the IFN-γ production, they were also optimal stimuli to interleukin-17 (IL-17) production. A positive correlation between IL-17 and IFN-γ secretion was observed in cultures of PBMCs with all vaginal-dysbiosis-associated bacteria suggesting that the adaptive immune response induced by these strains is not dominated by TH1 differentiation with reduced availability of IFN-γ, cytokine most effective in supporting virus clearance. Based on these results, we suggest that a vaginal microbiota dominated by lactobacilli, especially by L. gasseri or L. jensenii, may be able to assist immune cells with clearing HPV infection, bypasses the viral escape and restores immune homeostasis.

## Finding a Balance in the Vaginal Microbiome: How Do We Treat and Prevent the Occurrence of Bacterial Vaginosis?
 05.07.2021, _RJ Joseph, HL Ser, YH Kuai, LT Tan, VJT Arasoo, V Letchumanan, L Wang, P Pusparajah, BH Goh, NS Ab Mutalib, KG Chan, LH Lee_


Bacterial vaginosis (BV) has been reported in one-third of women worldwide at different life stages, due to the complex balance in the ecology of the vaginal microbiota. It is a common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge and is associated with other health issues. Since the first description of anaerobic microbes associated with BV like Gardnerella vaginalis in the 1950s, researchers have stepped up the game by incorporating advanced molecular tools to monitor and evaluate the extent of dysbiosis within the vaginal microbiome, particularly on how specific microbial population changes compared to a healthy state. Moreover, treatment failure and BV recurrence rate remain high despite the standard antibiotic treatment. Consequently, researchers have been probing into alternative or adjunct treatments, including probiotics or even vaginal microbiota transplants, to ensure successful treatment outcomes and reduce the colonization by pathogenic microbes of the female reproductive tract. The current review summarizes the latest findings in probiotics use for BV and explores the potential of vaginal microbiota transplants in restoring vaginal health.

## Characterizing the Effects of Calcium and Prebiotic Fiber on Human Gut Microbiota Composition and Function Using a Randomized Crossover Design-A Feasibility Study.
 05.07.2021, _LS Yoon, KB Michels_


Consumption of prebiotic inulin has been found to increase calcium absorption, which may protect against gut diseases such as colorectal cancer. This dietary relation may be modulated by compositional changes in the gut microbiota; however, no human study has addressed this hypothesis. We determined the feasibility of a randomized crossover trial to evaluate the effect of three interventions (combined calcium and inulin supplementation, calcium supplementation alone, and inulin supplementation alone) on the intestinal microbiota composition and function. We conducted a 16-week pilot study in 12 healthy adults who consumed the three interventions in a random sequence. Participants provided fecal and blood samples before and after each intervention. Each intervention period lasted four weeks and was flanked by one-week washout periods. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and quantification of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) was determined in fecal samples. Systemic lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) was quantified in serum. Of the 12 individuals assigned to an intervention sequence, seven completed the study. Reasons for dropout included time (n = 3), gastrointestinal discomfort (n = 1), and moving (n = 1). Overall, participants reported positive attitudes towards the protocol (n = 9) but were unsatisfied by the practicalities of supplement consumption (44%) and experienced digestive discomfort (56%). We found no appreciable differences in microbial composition, SCFA concentration, nor LBP concentrations when comparing intervention periods. In conclusion, an intervention study using a randomized crossover design with calcium and a prebiotic fiber is feasible. Improvements of our study design include using a lower dose prebiotic fiber supplement and a larger sample size.

We aimed to differentiate gut microbiota composition of overweight/obese and lean subjects and to determine its association with clinical variables and dietary intake. A cross-sectional study was performed with 96 overweight/obese subjects and 32 lean subjects. Anthropometric parameters were positively associated with Collinsella aerofaciens, Dorea formicigenerans and Dorea longicatena, which had higher abundance the overweight/obese subjects. Moreover, different genera of Lachnospiraceae were negatively associated with body fat, LDL and total cholesterol. Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were negatively associated with the genus Intestinimonas, a biomarker of the overweight/obese group, whereas SFAs were positively associated with Roseburia, a biomarker for the lean group. In conclusion, Dorea formicigenerans, Dorea longicatena and Collinsella aerofaciens could be considered obesity biomarkers, Lachnospiraceae is associated with lipid cardiovascular risk factors. SFAs exhibited opposite association profiles with butyrate-producing bacteria depending on the BMI. Thus, the relationship between diet and microbiota opens new tools for the management of obesity.

## Modulation of Gut Microbiota for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19.
 02.07.2021, _J Chen, L Vitetta_


The gut microbiota is well known to exert multiple benefits on human health including protection from disease causing pathobiont microbes. It has been recognized that healthy intestinal microbiota is of great importance in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Gut dysbiosis caused by various reasons is associated with severe COVID-19. Therefore, the modulation of gut microbiota and supplementation of commensal bacterial metabolites could reduce the severity of COVID-19. Many approaches have been studied to improve gut microbiota in COVID-19 including probiotics, bacterial metabolites, and prebiotics, as well as nutraceuticals and trace elements. So far, 19 clinical trials for testing the efficacy of probiotics and synbiotics in COVID-19 prevention and treatment are ongoing. In this narrative review, we summarize the effects of various approaches on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and discuss associated mechanisms.

## COVID-19 Lockdowns May Reduce Resistance Genes Diversity in the Human Microbiome and the Need for Antibiotics.
 02.07.2021, _JS Rebelo, CPF Domingues, F Dionisio, MC Gomes, A Botelho, T Nogueira_


Recently, much attention has been paid to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet bacterial resistance to antibiotics remains a serious and unresolved public health problem that kills hundreds of thousands of people annually, being an insidious and silent pandemic. To contain the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, populations confined and tightened hygiene measures. We performed this study with computer simulations and by using mobility data of mobile phones from Google in the region of Lisbon, Portugal, comprising 3.7 million people during two different lockdown periods, scenarios of 40 and 60% mobility reduction. In the simulations, we assumed that the network of physical contact between people is that of a small world and computed the antibiotic resistance in human microbiomes after 180 days in the simulation. Our simulations show that reducing human contacts drives a reduction in the diversity of antibiotic resistance genes in human microbiomes. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's pairwise tests show very strong evidence (p &lt; 0.000, adjusted using the Bonferroni correction) of a difference between the four confinement regimes. The proportion of variability in the ranked dependent variable accounted for by the confinement variable was η2 = 0.148, indicating a large effect of confinement on the diversity of antibiotic resistance. We have shown that confinement and hygienic measures, in addition to reducing the spread of pathogenic bacteria in a human network, also reduce resistance and the need to use antibiotics.

## Reversion of Gut Microbiota during the Recovery Phase in Patients with Asymptomatic or Mild COVID-19: Longitudinal Study.
 05.07.2021, _HN Kim, EJ Joo, CW Lee, KS Ahn, HL Kim, DI Park, SK Park_


Patients with COVID-19 have been reported to experience gastrointestinal symptoms as well as respiratory symptoms, but the effects of COVID-19 on the gut microbiota are poorly understood. We explored gut microbiome profiles associated with the respiratory infection of SARS-CoV-2 during the recovery phase in patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. A longitudinal analysis was performed using the same patients to determine whether the gut microbiota changed after recovery from COVID-19. We applied 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to analyze two paired fecal samples from 12 patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Fecal samples were selected at two time points: during SARS-CoV-2 infection (infected state) and after negative conversion of the viral RNA (recovered state). We also compared the microbiome data with those from 36 healthy controls. Microbial evenness of the recovered state was significantly increased compared with the infected state. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the depletion of Bacteroidetes, while an abundance was observed with a tendency to rapidly reverse in the recovered state. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the infected state was markedly higher than that in the recovered state. Gut dysbiosis was observed after infection even in patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19, while the composition of the gut microbiota was recovered after negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Modifying intestinal microbes in response to COVID-19 might be a useful therapeutic alternative.

## Flavonoids from Whole-Grain Oat Alleviated High-Fat Diet-Induced Hyperlipidemia via Regulating Bile Acid Metabolism and Gut Microbiota in Mice.
 02.07.2021, _R Duan, X Guan, K Huang, Y Zhang, S Li, J Xia, M Shen_


A high-fat diet (HFD) causes hyperlipidemia, which worsens disturbances in bile acid (BA) metabolism and gut microbiota. This study aimed to investigate the regulation of flavonoids from whole-grain oat (FO) on BA metabolism and gut microbiota in HFD-induced hyperlipidemic mice. The experiment results showed that FO improved serum lipid profiles and decreased body weight and lipid deposition in HFD-fed mice. Through real-time qualitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot assays, by up-regulating the expression of PPARα, CPT-1, CYP7A1, FXR, TGR5, NTCP, and BSTP, and down-regulating those of SREBP-1c, FAS, and ASBT, FO suppressed lipogenesis, promoted lipolysis and BA synthesis, and efflux to faeces via the FXR pathway. 16s rRNA sequencing revealed that FO significantly increased Akkermansia and significantly decreased Lachnoclostridium, Blautia, Colidextribacter, and Desulfovibrio. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that these bacteria were strongly correlated with hyperlipidemia-related parameters. Therefore, our results indicated that FO possessed an antihyperlipidemic effect via regulating the gut-liver axis, i.e., BA metabolism and gut microbiota.

## Novel Targeted Biological Agents for the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis.
 02.07.2021, _N Yang, Z Chen, X Zhang, Y Shi_


Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory dermatologic disease clinically characterized by intense itch, recurrent eczematous lesions, and a chronic or relapsing disease course. Mild-to-moderate AD can be controlled by using moisturizers and topical immunomodulators such as topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. If topical therapies fail, phototherapy and systemic immunosuppressant therapies, such as ciclosporin, methotrexate, and azathioprine, can be considered. However, relapse and side effects could still occur. The pathogenesis of AD involves epidermal barrier dysfunction, skin microbiome abnormalities, and cutaneous inflammation. Inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-33, IL-17, IL-23, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, are involved in AD development. Therefore, a series of biological agents targeting these cytokines are promising approaches for treating AD. Dupilumab is the first biological agent approved for the treatment of AD in patients aged 6 years and older in the United States. Tralokinumab, lebrikizumab, and nemolizumab have also been confirmed to have significant efficacy against AD in phase III or IIb clinical trials. Also, fezakinumab was effective in severe AD patients in a phase IIa trial. However, phase II trials of ustekinumab, tezepelumab, etokimab, secukinumab, and omalizumab have failed to meet their primary endpoints. Phase II trials of GBR 830 and KHK 4083 are ongoing. In general, further studies are needed to explore new therapeutic targets and improve the efficacy of biological agents.

## Influence of Lactobacillus paracasei HII01 Supplementation on Glycemia and Inflammatory Biomarkers in Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
 02.07.2021, _P Toejing, N Khampithum, S Sirilun, C Chaiyasut, N Lailerd_


It has been shown that gut dysbiosis can be associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Consequently, intervention with probiotics may be a useful approach to improve metabolic variables in diabetes. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of L. paracasei HII01 on glycemia in T2DM patients. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 participants were allocated to receive L. paracasei HII01 (50 × 109 CFU/day) or a placebo (corn starch 10 mg/day). Blood and fecal samples were assessed at baseline and at the end of the trial. After 12 weeks of intervention, fasting blood glucose level had significantly decreased in the probiotic group compared with the placebo group. Importantly, probiotic supplementation significantly decreased the plasma levels of LPS, TNF-α, IL-6 and hsCRP compared the placebo group. Additionally, an increase in beneficial bacteria and a decrease in pathogenic bacteria, which related to the improvement of SCFAs, was found following L. paracasei HII01 supplementation. These findings demonstrated that L. paracasei HII01 improved hyperglycemia and inflammatory markers by favorably modifying gut microbiota and subsequently ameliorating the leaky gut and endotoxemia, thereby suggesting a potential role as an adjuvant treatment in type 2 diabetes.

Antimicrobial resistance poses super challenges in both human health and livestock production. Rumen microbiota is a large reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which show significant varations in different host species and lifestyles. To compare the microbiome and resistome between dairy cows and dairy buffaloes, the microbial composition, functions and harbored ARGs of rumen microbiota were explored between 16 dairy cows (3.93 ± 1.34 years old) and 15 dairy buffaloes (4.80 ± 3.49 years old) using metagenomics.

## Microbiome-mediated effects of habitat fragmentation on native plant performance.
 02.07.2021, _KN Kiesewetter, ME Afkhami_


●Habitat fragmentation is a leading cause of biodiversity and ecosystem function loss in the Anthropocene. Despite the importance of plant-microbiome interactions to ecosystem productivity, we have limited knowledge of how fragmentation affects microbiomes and even less knowledge of its consequences for microbial interactions with plants. ●Combining field surveys, microbiome sequencing, manipulative experiments, and random forest models, we (1) investigated fragmentation legacy effects on soil microbiomes in imperiled Pine Rocklands, (2) tested how compositional shifts across 14 fragmentation-altered soil microbiomes affected performance and resource allocation of three native plant species, and (3) identified fragmentation-responding microbial families underpinning plant performance. ●Legacies of habitat fragmentation were associated with significant changes in microbial diversity and composition (across three of four community axes). Experiments showed plants often strongly benefited from the microbiome's presence, but fragmentation-associated changes in microbiome composition also significantly affected plant performance and resource allocation across all seven metrics examined. Finally, random forest models identified ten fungal and six bacterial families important for plant performance that changed significantly with fragmentation. ●Our findings not only support the existence of significant fragmentation effects on natural microbiomes, but also demonstrate for the first time that fragmentation-associated changes in microbiomes can have meaningful consequences for native plant performance and investment.

Chemical exposure can indirectly affect leaf microbiota communities, but the mechanism driving this phenomenon remains largely unknown. Results revealed that the co-exposure of glyphosate and multi-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) caused a synergistic inhibitory effect on the growth and metabolism of Arabidopsis thaliana shoots. However, only a slight inhibitory effect was induced by nanotubes or glyphosate alone at the tested concentrations. Several intermediate metabolites of nitrogen metabolism and fatty acid synthesis pathways were upregulated under the combined treatment, which increased the amount of energy required to alleviate the disruption caused by the combined treatment. Additionally, compared with the two individual treatments, the glyphosate/nanotube combination treatment induced greater fluctuations in the phyllosphere bacterial community members with low abundance (relative abundance (RA) &lt;1%) at both the family and genus levels, and among these bacteria some plant growth promotion and nutrient supplement related bacteria were markable increased. Strikingly, strong correlations between phyllosphere bacterial diversity and metabolites suggested a potential role of leaf metabolism, particularly nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism, in restricting the range of leaf microbial taxa. These correlations between phyllosphere bacterial diversity and leaf metabolism will improve our understanding of plant-microbe interactions and the extent of their drivers of variation and the underlying causes of variability in bacterial community composition.

## phyLoSTM: a novel deep learning model on disease prediction from longitudinal microbiome data.
 02.07.2021, _D Sharma, W Xu_


Research shows that human microbiome is highly dynamic on longitudinal timescales, changing dynamically with diet, or due to medical interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework "phyLoSTM", using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) for feature extraction and analysis of temporal dependency in longitudinal microbiome sequencing data along with host's environmental factors for disease prediction. Additional novelty in terms of handling variable timepoints in subjects through LSTMs, as well as, weight balancing between imbalanced cases and controls is proposed.

## Joint modeling of zero-inflated longitudinal proportions and time-to-event data with application to a gut microbiome study.
 02.07.2021, _J Hu, C Wang, MJ Blaser, H Li_


Recent studies have suggested that the temporal dynamics of the human microbiome may have associations with human health and disease. An increasing number of longitudinal microbiome studies, which record time to disease onset, aim to identify candidate microbes as biomarkers for prognosis. Owing to the ultra-skewness and sparsity of microbiome proportion (relative abundance) data, directly applying traditional statistical methods may result in substantial power loss or spurious inferences. We propose a novel joint modeling framework [JointMM], which is comprised of two sub-models: a longitudinal sub-model called zero-inflated scaled-Beta generalized linear mixed-effects regression to depict the temporal structure of microbial proportions among subjects; and a survival sub-model to characterize the occurrence of an event and its relationship with the longitudinal microbiome proportions. JointMM is specifically designed to handle the zero-inflated and highly skewed longitudinal microbial proportion data and examine whether the temporal pattern of microbial presence and/or the non-zero microbial proportions are associated with differences in the time to an event. The longitudinal sub-model of JointMM also provides the capacity to investigate how the (time-varying) covariates are related to the temporal microbial presence/absence patterns and/or the changing trend in non-zero proportions. Comprehensive simulations and real data analyses are used to assess the statistical efficiency and interpretability of JointMM. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
