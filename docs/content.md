Recent evidence demonstrates potential links between mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In addition, bidirectional interactions between the intestinal microbiota and host mitochondria may modulate intestinal inflammation. We observed previously that mice deficient in the mitochondrial protein MCJ (Methylation-controlled J protein) exhibit increased susceptibility to DSS colitis. However, it is unclear whether this phenotype is primarily driven by MCJ-/- associated gut microbiota dysbiosis or by direct effects of MCJ-deficiency. Here, we demonstrate that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from MCJ-deficient into germ-free mice was sufficient to confer increased susceptibility to colitis. Therefore, an FMT experiment by cohousing was designed to alter MCJ-deficient microbiota. The phenotype resulting from complex I deficiency was reverted by FMT. In addition, we determined the protein expression pathways impacted by MCJ deficiency, providing insight into the pathophysiology of IBD. Further, we used magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize taxa-specific coating of the intestinal microbiota with Immunoglobulin A (IgA-SEQ) in MCJ-deficient mice. We show that high IgA coating of fecal bacteria observed in MCJ-deficient mice play a potential role in disease progression. This study allowed us to identify potential microbial signatures in feces associated with complex I deficiency and disease progression. This research highlights the importance of finding microbial biomarkers, which might serve as predictors, permitting the stratification of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients into distinct clinical entities of the UC spectrum.

## The recovery of the microbial community after plaque removal depends on periodontal health status.
 10.10.2023, _X Li, C Yu, B Zhang, X Shan, W Mao, Z Zhang, C Wang, X Jin, J Wang, H Zhao_


Plaque accumulation and microbial community changes are important causes of periodontal disease. Cleaned plaque microorganisms will reattach to form biofilms, but the recovery and outcome of plaque microbial communities in different periodontal health states remain unknown. In this study, we tracked the biofilm remodeling process in 206 dental plaque samples from 40 healthy periodontal, gingivitis and periodontitis volunteers at 6 time points before and after supragingival scaling. We found that microbial communities of different periodontal states changed asynchronously during the process, and the more severe the periodontal disease condition, the more lagged the recovery of plaque microorganisms to their original state after cleaning; this reflected a higher degree of plaque development in periodontitis samples. The plaque index and bleeding index were significantly correlated with plaque recovery, especially the recovery of bacteria such as Abiotrophia and Capnocytophaga. Meanwhile, we found that the microbial community structure of different periodontal health states was most similar at the Day 3 after plaque cleaning, and the communities gradually differentiated and developed in different directions. Abiotrophia and other bacteria might play an important role in determining the development trend of plaque biofilms. The discovery of specific time points and bacteria was of great value in clarifying the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and in seeking targets for prevention and treatment.

The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, forced us to face a pandemic with unprecedented social, economic, and public health consequences. Several nations have launched campaigns to immunize millions of people using various vaccines to prevent infections. Meanwhile, therapeutic approaches and discoveries continuously arise; however, identifying infected patients that are going to experience the more severe outcomes of COVID-19 is still a major need, to focus therapeutic efforts, reducing hospitalization and mitigating drug adverse effects. Microbial communities colonizing the respiratory tract exert significant effects on host immune responses, influencing the susceptibility to infectious agents. Through 16S rDNAseq we characterized the upper airways' microbiota of 192 subjects with nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were divided into groups based on the presence of symptoms, pneumonia severity, and need for oxygen therapy or intubation. Indeed, unlike most of the literature, our study focuses on identifying microbial signatures predictive of disease progression rather than on the probability of infection itself, for which a consensus is lacking. Diversity, differential abundance, and network analysis at different taxonomic levels were synergistically adopted, in a robust bioinformatic pipeline, highlighting novel possible taxa correlated with patients' disease progression to intubation.

## COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-mediated antibodies in human breast milk and their association with breast milk microbiota composition.
 10.10.2023, _S Zhao, KYW Lok, ZY Sin, Y Peng, HSL Fan, N Nagesh, MSL Choi, JYY Kwok, EPH Choi, X Zhang, HK Wai, LCH Tsang, SSM Cheng, MKL Wong, J Zhu, CKP Mok, SC Ng, FKL Chan, M Peiris, LLM Poon, HM Tun_


Newborns can acquire immunological protection to SARS-CoV-2 through vaccine-conferred antibodies in human breast milk. However, there are some concerns around lactating mothers with regards to potential short- and long-term adverse events and vaccine-induced changes to their breast milk microbiome composition, which helps shape the early-life microbiome. Thus, we sought to explore if SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine could change breast milk microbiota and how the changes impact the levels of antibodies in breast milk. We recruited 49 lactating mothers from Hong Kong who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine between June 2021 and August 2021. Breast milk samples were self-collected by participants pre-vaccination, one week post-first dose, one week post-second dose, and one month post-second dose. The levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgA and IgG in breast milk peaked at one week post-second dose. Subsequently, the levels of both antibodies rapidly waned in breast milk, with IgA levels returning to baseline levels one month post-second dose. The richness and composition of human breast milk microbiota changed dynamically throughout the vaccination regimen, but the abundances of beneficial microbes such as Bifidobacterium species did not significantly change after vaccination. Additionally, we found that baseline breast milk bacterial composition can predict spike-specific IgA levels at one week post-second dose (Area Under Curve: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.85). Taken together, our results identified specific breast milk microbiota markers associated with high levels of IgA in the breast milk following BNT162b2 vaccine. Furthermore, in lactating mothers, BNT162b2 vaccines did not significantly reduce probiotic species in breast milk.

## Spatial diversity of the skin bacteriome.
 06.10.2023, _M Pérez-Losada, KA Crandall_


The bacterial communities of the human skin impact its physiology and homeostasis, hence elucidating the composition and structure of the healthy skin bacteriome is paramount to understand how bacterial imbalance (i.e., dysbiosis) may lead to disease. To obtain an integrated view of the spatial diversity of the skin bacteriome, we surveyed from 2019 to 2023 five skin regions (belly button, behind ears, between toes, calves and forearms) with different physiological characteristics (dry, moist and sebaceous) in 129 healthy adults (579 samples - after data cleaning). Estimating bacterial diversity through 16S rRNA metataxonomics, we identified significant (p &lt; 0.0001) differences in the bacterial relative abundance of the four most abundant phyla and 11 genera, alpha- and beta-diversity indices and predicted functional profiles (36 to 400 metabolic pathways) across skin regions and microenvironments. No significant differences, however, were observed across genders, ages, and ethnicities. As previously suggested, dry skin regions (forearms and calves) were more even, richer, and functionally distinct than sebaceous (behind ears) and moist (belly button and between toes) regions. Within skin regions, bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity also varied significantly for some of the years compared, suggesting that skin bacterial stability may be region and subject dependent. Our results, hence, confirm that the skin bacteriome varies systematically across skin regions and microenvironments and provides new insights into the internal and external factors driving bacterial diversity.

## Microbiota-gut-brain axis drives overeating disorders.
 05.10.2023, _S Fan, W Guo, D Xiao, M Guan, T Liao, S Peng, A Feng, Z Wang, H Yin, M Li, J Chen, W Xiong_


Overeating disorders (ODs), usually stemming from dieting history and stress, remain a pervasive issue in contemporary society, with the pathological mechanisms largely unresolved. Here, we show that alterations in intestinal microbiota are responsible for the excessive intake of palatable foods in OD mice and patients with bulimia nervosa (BN). Stress combined with a history of dieting causes significant changes in the microbiota and the intestinal metabolism, which disinhibit the vagus nerve terminals in the gut and thereby lead to a subsequent hyperactivation of the gut-brain axis passing through the vagus, the solitary tract nucleus, and the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. The transplantation of a probiotic Faecalibacterium prausnitzii or dietary supplement of key metabolites restores the activity of the gut-to-brain pathway and thereby alleviates the OD symptoms. Thus, our study delineates how the microbiota-gut-brain axis mediates energy balance, unveils the underlying pathogenesis of the OD, and provides potential therapeutic strategies.

## Human-gut bacterial protein-protein interactions: understudied but impactful to human health.
 07.10.2023, _D Balint, IL Brito_


The human gut microbiome is associated with a wide range of diseases; yet, the mechanisms these microbes use to influence human health are not fully understood. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are increasingly identified as a potential mechanism by which gut microbiota influence their human hosts. Similar to some PPIs observed in pathogens, many disease-relevant human-gut bacterial PPIs function by interacting with components of the immune system or the gut barrier. Here, we highlight recent advances in these two areas. It is our opinion that there is a vastly unexplored network of human-gut bacterial PPIs that contribute to the prevention or pathogenesis of various diseases and that future research is warranted to expand PPI discovery.

## Progress of linking gut microbiota and musculoskeletal health: casualty, mechanisms, and translational values.
 06.10.2023, _Y Wang, Y Li, L Bo, E Zhou, Y Chen, S Naranmandakh, W Xie, Q Ru, L Chen, Z Zhu, C Ding, Y Wu_


The musculoskeletal system is important for balancing metabolic activity and maintaining health. Recent studies have shown that distortions in homeostasis of the intestinal microbiota are correlated with or may even contribute to abnormalities in musculoskeletal system function. Research has also shown that the intestinal flora and its secondary metabolites can impact the musculoskeletal system by regulating various phenomena, such as inflammation and immune and metabolic activities. Most of the existing literature supports that reasonable nutritional intervention helps to improve and maintain the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota, and may have a positive impact on musculoskeletal health. The purpose of organizing, summarizing and discussing the existing literature is to explore whether the intervention methods, including nutritional supplement and moderate exercise, can affect the muscle and bone health by regulating the microecology of the intestinal flora. More in-depth efficacy verification experiments will be helpful for clinical applications.

## The microbial landscape of colorectal cancer.
 04.10.2023, _MT White, CL Sears_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a substantial source of global morbidity and mortality in dire need of improved prevention and treatment strategies. As our understanding of CRC grows, it is becoming increasingly evident that the gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms in direct interface with the colon, plays a substantial role in CRC development and progression. Understanding the roles that individual microorganisms and complex microbial communities play in CRC pathogenesis, along with their attendant mechanisms, will help yield novel preventive and therapeutic interventions for CRC. In this Review, we discuss recent evidence concerning global perturbations of the gut microbiota in CRC, associations of specific microorganisms with CRC, the underlying mechanisms by which microorganisms potentially drive CRC development and the roles of complex microbial communities in CRC pathogenesis. While our understanding of the relationship between the microbiota and CRC has improved in recent years, our findings highlight substantial gaps in current research that need to be filled before this knowledge can be used to the benefit of patients.

## Probiogenomics of Leuconostoc Mesenteroides Strains F-21 and F-22 Isolated from Human Breast Milk Reveal Beneficial Properties.
 07.10.2023, _JC Ariute, ND Coelho-Rocha, CWD Dantas, LAT de Vasconcelos, R Profeta, T de Jesus Sousa, A de Souza Novaes, B Galotti, LG Gomes, EGT Gimenez, C Diniz, MV Dias, LCL de Jesus, AK Jaiswal, S Tiwari, R Carvalho, AM Benko-Iseppon, B Brenig, V Azevedo, D Barh, FS Martins, F Aburjaile_


Bacteria of the Leuconostoc genus are Gram-positive bacteria that are commonly found in raw milk and persist in fermented dairy products and plant food. Studies have already explored the probiotic potential of L. mesenteroides, but not from a probiogenomic perspective, which aims to explore the molecular features responsible for their phenotypes. In the present work, probiogenomic approaches were applied in strains F-21 and F-22 of L. mesenteroides isolated from human milk to assess their biosafety at the molecular level and to correlate molecular features with their potential probiotic characteristics. The complete genome of strain F-22 is 1.99 Mb and presents one plasmid, while the draft genome of strain F-21 is 1.89 Mb and presents four plasmids. A high percentage of average nucleotide identity among other genomes of L. mesenteroides (≥ 96%) corroborated the previous taxonomic classification of these isolates. Genomic regions that influence the probiotic properties were identified and annotated. Both strains exhibited wide genome plasticity, cell adhesion ability, proteolytic activity, proinflammatory and immunomodulation capacity through interaction with TLR-NF-κB and TLR-MAPK pathway components, and no antimicrobial resistance, denoting their potential to be candidate probiotics. Further, the strains showed bacteriocin production potential and the presence of acid, thermal, osmotic, and bile salt resistance genes, indicating their ability to survive under gastrointestinal stress. Taken together, our results suggest that L. mesenteroides F-21 and F-22 are promising candidates for probiotics in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

Beer is a source of bioactive compounds, mainly polyphenols, which can reach the large intestine and interact with colonic microbiota. However, the effects of beer consumption in the gastrointestinal function have scarcely been studied. This paper reports, for the first time, the in vitro digestion of beer and its impact on intestinal microbiota metabolism. Three commercial beers of different styles were subjected to gastrointestinal digestion using the simgi® model, and the digested fluids were further fermented in triplicate with faecal microbiota from a healthy volunteer. The effect of digested beer on human gut microbiota was evaluated in terms of microbial metabolism (short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and ammonium ion), microbial diversity and bacterial populations (plate counting and 16S rRNA gene sequencing). Monitoring beer polyphenols through the different digestion phases showed their extensive metabolism, mainly at the colonic stage. In addition, a higher abundance of taxa related to gut health, especially Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Mitsuokella and Succinilasticum at the genus level, and the Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae families were found in the presence of beers. Regarding microbial metabolism, beer feeding significantly increased microbial SCFA production (mainly butyric acid) and decreased ammonium content. Overall, these results evidence the positive actions of moderate beer consumption on the metabolic activity of colonic microbiota, suggesting that the raw materials and brewing methods used may affect the beer gut effects.

The maternal microbiome is an important regulator of gestational health, but how it affects the placenta as the interface between mother and fetus remains unexplored. Here, we show that the maternal gut microbiota supports placental development in mice. Depletion of the maternal gut microbiota restricts placental growth and impairs feto-placental vascularization. The maternal gut microbiota modulates metabolites in the maternal and fetal circulation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) stimulate cultured endothelial cell tube formation and prevent abnormalities in placental vascularization in microbiota-deficient mice. Furthermore, in a model of maternal malnutrition, gestational supplementation with SCFAs prevents placental growth restriction and vascular insufficiency. These findings highlight the importance of host-microbial symbioses during pregnancy and reveal that the maternal gut microbiome promotes placental growth and vascularization in mice.

## Compost, plants and endophytes versus metal contamination: choice of a restoration strategy steers the microbiome in polymetallic mine waste.
 10.10.2023, _M Kracmarova-Farren, J Papik, O Uhlik, J Freeman, A Foster, MC Leewis, C Creamer_


Finding solutions for the remediation and restoration of abandoned mining areas is of great environmental importance as they pose a risk to ecosystem health. In this study, our aim was to determine how remediation strategies with (i) compost amendment, (ii) planting a metal-tolerant grass Bouteloua curtipendula, and (iii) its inoculation with beneficial endophytes influenced the microbiome of metal-contaminated tailings originating from the abandoned Blue Nose Mine, SE Arizona, near Patagonia (USA). We conducted an indoor microcosm experiment followed by a metataxonomic analysis of the mine tailings, compost, and root samples. Our results showed that each remediation strategy promoted a distinct pattern of microbial community structure in the mine tailings, which correlated with changes in their chemical properties. The combination of compost amendment and endophyte inoculation led to the highest prokaryotic diversity and total nitrogen and organic carbon, but also induced shifts in microbial community structure that significantly correlated with an enhanced potential for mobilization of Cu and Sb. Our findings show that soil health metrics (total nitrogen, organic carbon and pH) improved, and microbial community changed, due to organic matter input and endophyte inoculation, which enhanced metal leaching from the mine waste and potentially increased environmental risks posed by Cu and Sb. We further emphasize that because the initial choice of remediation strategy can significantly impact trace element mobility via modulation of both soil chemistry and microbial communities, site specific, bench-scale preliminary tests, as reported here, can help determine the potential risk of a chosen strategy.

## Litter decomposition and nutrient release are faster under secondary forests than under Chinese fir plantations with forest development.
 10.10.2023, _S Li, Z Xu, Z Yu, Y Fu, X Su, B Zou, S Wang, Z Huang, X Wan_


In terrestrial ecosystems, leaf litter is the main source of nutrients returning to the soil. Understanding how litter decomposition responds to stand age is critical for improving predictions of the effects of forest age structure on nutrient availability and cycling in ecosystems. However, the changes in this critical process with stand age remain poorly understood due to the complexity and diversity of litter decomposition patterns and drivers among different stand ages. In this study, we examined the effects of stand age on litter decomposition with two well-replicated age sequences of naturally occurring secondary forests and Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations in southern China. Our results showed that the litter decomposition rates in the secondary forests were significantly higher than those in the Chinese fir plantations of the same age, except for 40-year-old forests. The litter decomposition rate of the Chinese fir initially increased and then decreased with stand age, while that of secondary forests gradually decreased. The results of a structural equation model indicated that stand age, litter quality and microbial community were the primary factors driving nutrient litter loss. Overall, these findings are helpful for understanding the effects of stand age on the litter decomposition process and nutrient cycling in plantation and secondary forest ecosystems.

The gut microbiota play important roles in host adaptation and evolution, but are understudied in natural population of wild mammals. To address host adaptive evolution and improve conservation efforts of threatened mammals from a metagenomic perspective, we established a high-quality gut microbiome catalog of the giant panda (pandaGUT) to resolve the microbiome diversity, functional, and resistome landscapes using approximately 7 Tbp of long- and short-read sequencing data from 439 stool samples.

## The newest Oxford Nanopore R10.4.1 full-length 16S rRNA sequencing enables the accurate resolution of species-level microbial community profiling.
 06.10.2023, _T Zhang, H Li, S Ma, J Cao, H Liao, Q Huang, W Chen_


The long-read amplicon provides a species-level solution for the community. With the improvement of nanopore flowcells, the accuracy of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) R10.4.1 has been substantially enhanced, with an average of approximately 99%. To evaluate its effectiveness on amplicons, three types of microbiomes were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA (hereinafter referred to as "16S") amplicon sequencing using Novaseq, Pacbio sequel II, and Nanopore PromethION platforms (R9.4.1 and R10.4.1) in the current study. We showed the error rate, recall, precision, and bias index in the mock sample. The error rate of ONT R10.4.1 was greatly reduced, with a better recall in the case of the synthetic community. Meanwhile, in different types of environmental samples, ONT R10.4.1 analysis resulted in a composition similar to Pacbio data. We found that classification tools and databases influence ONT data. Based on these results, we conclude that the ONT R10.4.1 16S amplicon can also be used for application in environmental samples. IMPORTANCE The long-read amplicon supplies the community with a species-level solution. Due to the high error rate of nanopore sequencing early on, it has not been frequently used in 16S studies. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) introduced the R10.4.1 flowcell with Q20+ reagent to achieve more than 99% accuracy as sequencing technology advanced. However, there has been no published study on the performance of commercial PromethION sequencers with R10.4.1 flowcells on 16S sequencing or on the impact of accuracy improvement on taxonomy (R9.4.1 to R10.4.1) using 16S ONT data. In this study, three types of microbiomes were investigated by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing using Novaseq, Pacbio sequel II, and Nanopore PromethION platforms (R9.4.1 and R10.4.1). In the mock sample, we displayed the error rate, recall, precision, and bias index. We observed that the error rate in ONT R10.4.1 is significantly lower, especially when deletions are involved. First and foremost, R10.4.1 and Pacific Bioscience platforms reveal a similar microbiome in environmental samples. This study shows that the R10.4.1 full-length 16S rRNA sequences allow for species identification of environmental microbiota.
