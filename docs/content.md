## Gut Microbiota Resilience: Definition, Link to Health and Strategies for Intervention.
 13.10.2020, _SK Dogra, J Doré, S Damak_


The gut microbiota is a new frontier in health and disease. Not only many diseases are associated with perturbed microbiota, but an increasing number of studies point to a cause-effect relationship. Defining a healthy microbiota is not possible at the current state of our knowledge mostly because of high interindividual variability. A resilient microbiota could be used as surrogate for healthy microbiota. In addition, the gut microbiota is an "organ" with frontline exposure to environmental changes and insults. During the lifetime of an individual, it is exposed to challenges such as unhealthy diet, medications and infections. Impaired ability to bounce back to the pre-challenge baseline may lead to dysbiosis. It is therefore legitimate to postulate that maintaining a resilient microbiota may be important for health. Here we review the concept of resilience, what is known about the characteristics of a resilient microbiota, and how to assess microbiota resilience experimentally using a model of high fat diet challenge in humans. Interventions to maintain microbiota resilience can be guided by the knowledge of what microbial species or functions are perturbed by challenges, and designed to replace diminished species with probiotics, when available, or boost them with prebiotics. Fibers with multiple structures and composition can also be used to increase microbiota diversity, a characteristic of the microbiota that may be associated with resilience. We finally discuss some open questions and knowledge gaps.

## Effect of a Nonoptimal Cervicovaginal Microbiota and Psychosocial Stress on Recurrent Spontaneous Preterm Birth.
 09.10.2020, _KD Gerson, C Mccarthy, J Ravel, MA Elovitz, HH Burris_


While select cervicovaginal microbiota and psychosocial factors have been associated with spontaneous preterm birth, their effect on the risk of recurrence remains unclear. It is also unknown whether psychosocial factors amplify underlying biologic risk. This study sought to determine the effect of nonoptimal cervicovaginal microbiota and perceived stress on the risk of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth.

## Comparison of soil microbial community between reseeding grassland and natural grassland in Songnen Meadow.
 12.10.2020, _R Zhu, J Liu, J Wang, W Han, Z Shen, TO Muraina, J Chen, D Sun_


Microorganisms have important ecological functions in ecosystems. Reseeding is considered as one of the main strategies for preventing grassland degradation in China. However, the response of soil microbial community and diversity to reseeding grassland (RG) and natural grassland (NG) remains unclear, especially in the Songnen Meadow. In this study, the soil microbial community compositions of two vegetation restoration types (RG vs NG) were analyzed using a high-throughput sequencing technique. A total of 23,142 microbial OTUs were detected, phylogenetically derived from 11 known bacterial phyla. Soil advantage categories included Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, which together accounted for &gt; 78% of the all phyla in vegetation restoration. The soil microbial diversity was higher in RG than in NG. Two types of vegetation restoration had significantly different characteristics of soil microbial community (P &lt; 0.001). Based on a molecular ecological network analysis, we found that the network in RG had a longer average path distance and modularity than in NG network, making it more resilient to environment changes. Meanwhile, the results of the canonical correspondence analysis and molecular ecological network analysis showed that soil pH (6.34 ± 0.35 in RG and 7.26 ± 0.28 in NG) was the main factor affecting soil microbial community structure, followed by soil moisture (SM) in the Songnen meadow, China. Besides, soil microbial community characteristics can vary significantly in different vegetation restoration. Thus, we suggested that it was necessary and reasonable for this area to popularize reseeding grassland in the future.

## Evidence for signatures of ancient microbial life in paleosols.
 09.10.2020, _K Frindte, E Lehndorff, S Vlaminck, K Werner, M Kehl, F Khormali, C Knief_


Loess-paleosol sequences are terrestrial archives of past climate change. They may host traces of ancient microbial life, but little information is available on the recovery of microbial biomarkers from such deposits. We hypothesized that microbial communities in soil horizons up to an age of 127 kyr carry information related to past environments. We extracted DNA from a loess-paleosol sequence near Toshan, Northern Iran, with 26 m thick deposits showing different degrees of soil development, performed quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Periods of soil formation archived within the loess sediment led to higher diversity and bacterial abundance in the paleosol horizons. Community composition fluctuated over the loess-paleosol sequence and was mainly correlated with age and depth, (ADONIS R2 &lt; 0.14, P ≤ 0.002), while responses to paleosol soil traits were weaker. Phyla like Bacteriodetes, Proteobacteria or Acidobacteria were more prevalent in paleosol horizons characterized by intense soil formation, while weakly developed paleosols or loess horizons hosted a higher percentage and diversity of Actinobacteria. Taken together, our findings indicate that the microbial community in loess-paleosol sequences carries signatures of earlier environmental conditions that are preserved until today.
