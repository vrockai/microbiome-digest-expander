Tuberculosis (TB) is the largest infectious disease with 10 million new active-TB patients and1.7 million deaths per year. Active-TB is an inflammatory disease and is increasingly viewed as an imbalance of immune responses to M. tb. infection. The mechanisms of a switch from latent infection to active disease is not well worked out but a shift in the immune responses is thought to be responsible. Increasingly, the role of gut microbiota has been described as a major influencer of the immune system. And because the gut is the largest immune organ, we aimed to analyze the gut microbiome in active-TB patients in a TB-endemic country, Pakistan. The study revealed that Ruminococcacea, Enetrobactericeae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Bifidobacterium, etc. were the major genera associated with active-TB, also associated with chronic inflammatory disease. Plasma antibody profiles against several M. tb. antigens, as specific biomarkers for active-TB, correlated closely with the patient gut microbial profiles. Besides, bcoA gene copy number, indicative of the level of butyrate production by the gut microbiome was five-fold lower in TB patients compared to healthy individuals. These findings suggest that gut health in TB patients is compromised, with implications for disease morbidity (e.g., severe weight loss) as well as immune impairment.

## Gut microbiota profile of Indonesian stunted children and children with normal nutritional status.
 26.01.2021, _IS Surono, D Widiyanti, PD Kusumo, K Venema_


The gut microbiota has been shown to play a role in energy metabolism of the host. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may predispose to obesity on the one hand, and stunting on the other. The aim of the study was to study the difference in gut microbiota composition of stunted Indonesian children and children of normal nutritional status between 3 and 5 years. Fecal samples and anthropometric measurements, in addition to economic and hygiene status were collected from 78 stunted children and 53 children with normal nutritional status in two regions in Banten and West Java provinces: Pandeglang and Sumedang, respectively. The gut microbiota composition was determined by sequencing amplicons of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The composition was correlated to nutritional status and anthropometric parameters. Macronutrient intake was on average lower in stunted children, while energy-loss in the form of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) appeared to be higher in stunted children. In stunted children, at the phylum level the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (44.4%) was significantly lower than in normal children (51.3%; p-value 2.55*10-4), while Firmicutes was significantly higher (45.7% vs. 39.8%; p-value 5.89*10-4). At the genus level, overall Prevotella 9 was the most abundant genus (average of 27%), and it was significantly lower in stunted children than in normal children (23.5% vs. 30.5%, respectively; q-value 0.059). Thirteen other genera were significantly different between stunted and normal children (q-value &lt; 0.1), some of which were at low relative abundance and present in only a few children. Prevotella 9 positively correlated with height (in line with its higher relative abundance in normal children) and weight. In conclusion, Prevotella 9, which was the most abundant genus in the children, was significantly lower in stunted children. The abundance of Prevotella has been correlated with dietary fibre intake, which was lower in these stunted children. Since fibres are fermented by the gut microbiota into SCFA, and these SCFA are a source of energy for the host, increasing the proportion of Prevotella in stunted children may be of benefit. Whether this would prevent the occurrence of stunting or even has the potential to revert it, remains to be seen in follow up research.

## Umbilical cord blood metabolome differs in relation to delivery mode, birth order and sex, maternal diet and possibly future allergy development in rural children.
 29.01.2021, _AB Ross, M Barman, O Hartvigsson, AC Lundell, O Savolainen, B Hesselmar, AE Wold, AS Sandberg_


Allergy is one of the most common diseases among young children yet all factors that affect development of allergy remain unclear. In a small cohort of 65 children living in the same rural area of south-west Sweden, we have previously found that maternal factors, including prenatal diet, affect childhood allergy risk, suggesting that in utero conditions may be important for allergy development. Here, we studied if metabolites in the umbilical cord blood of newborns may be related to development of childhood allergy, accounting for key perinatal factors such as mode of delivery, birth order and sex. Available umbilical cord blood plasma samples from 44 of the participants were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics; allergy was diagnosed by specialised paediatricians at ages 18 months, 3 years and 8 years and included eczema, asthma, food allergy and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Nineteen cord blood metabolites were related to future allergy diagnosis though there was no clear pattern of up- or downregulation of metabolic pathways. In contrast, perinatal factors birth order, sex and mode of delivery affected several energy and biosynthetic pathways, including glutamate and aspartic acid-histidine metabolism (p = 0.004) and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (p = 0.006) for birth order; branched chain amino acid metabolism (p = 0.0009) and vitamin B6 metabolism (p = 0.01) for sex; and glyoxylate and dicarboxylic acid metabolism (p = 0.005) for mode of delivery. Maternal diet was also related to some of the metabolites associated with allergy. In conclusion, the cord blood metabolome includes individual metabolites that reflect lifestyle, microbial and other factors that may be associated with future allergy diagnosis, and also reflects temporally close events/factors. Larger studies are required to confirm these associations, and perinatal factors such as birth order or siblings must be considered in future cord-blood metabolome studies.

## Innate gut microbiota predisposes to high alcohol consumption.

Gut microbiota is known to be transferred from the mother to their offspring. This study determines whether the innate microbiota of rats selectively bred for generations as high alcohol drinkers play a role in their alcohol intake. Wistar-derived high-drinker UChB rats (intake 10-g ethanol/kg/day) administered nonabsorbable oral antibiotics before allowing access to alcohol, reducing their voluntary ethanol intake by 70%, an inhibition that remained after the antibiotic administration was discontinued. Oral administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus Gorbach-Goldin (GG) induced the synthesis of FGF21, a vagal β-Klotho receptor agonist, and partially re-invoked a mechanism that reduces alcohol intake. The vagus nerve constitutes the main axis transferring gut microbiota information to the brain ("microbiota-gut-brain" axis). Bilateral vagotomy inhibited rat alcohol intake by 75%. Neither antibiotic treatment nor vagotomy affected total fluid intake. A microbiota-mediated marked inflammatory environment was observed in the gut of ethanol-naïve high-drinker rats, as gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α; IL-6; IL-1β) was significantly reduced by nonabsorbable antibiotic administration. Gut cytokines are known to activate the vagus nerve, while vagal activation induces pro-rewarding effects in nucleus accumbens. Both alcoholics and alcohol-preferring rats share a marked preference for sweet tastes-likely an evolutionary trait to seek sweet fermented fruits. Saccharin intake by UChB rats was inhibited by 75%-85% by vagotomy or oral antibiotic administration, despite saccharin-induced polydipsia. Overall, data indicate that the mechanisms that normally curtail heavy drinking are inhibited in alcohol-preferring animals and inform a gut microbiota origin. Whether it applies to other mammals and humans merits further investigation.

## Diet-induced changes in bacterial communities in the jejunum and their associations with bile acids in Angus beef cattle.
 30.01.2021, _J Liu, F Liu, W Cai, C Jia, Y Bai, Y He, W Zhu, RW Li, J Song_


The small intestine, while serving as the main absorption organ, also possesses a unique bacterial environment and holds the critical function of conversion of primary bile acids. Bile acids are, in turn, able to regulate bacterial composition and promote the growth of bacteria that convert primary bile acids to secondary bile acids. However, in beef cattle, few studies have explored the influence of diets on jejunal bacterial communities and examined its relationships with bile acids. Here, we examined the impact of grain- and grass-based diets on jejunal and fecal bacterial communities' composition and investigated possible association of bacterial features with bile acids.

## Investigation of the microbiota associated with ungerminated and germinated Norwegian barley cultivars with focus on lactic acid bacteria.
 01.02.2021, _HM Østlie, D Porcellato, G Kvam, T Wicklund_


The microbial community of ungerminated and germinated barley grains from three different cultivars grown at four different locations in Norway was investigated by culture dependent and culture independent methods. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was focused in this study and was isolated from germinated barley. The number of LAB ranged between 2.8 and 4.6 log cfu/g in ungerminated grains and between 4.9 and 6.3 log cfu/g in germinated grains. In total 66 out of 190 isolates were Gram+, catalase-negative and presumptive LAB. The LAB isolates were by 16S rRNA sequencing identified to be Carnobacterium maltaromaticum (6), Lactococcus lactis (2), Enterococcus sp. (1) and Leuconostoc sp. (57). Germination significantly influenced the bacterial composition. Regarding the different cultivars and growth places no significant difference in bacterial composition was seen. The most abundant bacterial genus was Pantoea (18.5% of the total sequences), followed by Rhizobium (10.1%) and Sphingomonas (9.9%). Fungal composition was significantly influenced by the germination process and the cultivation place, but no significant difference in fungal composition was detected between the 3 cultivars. The most abundant fungal genera were Cryptococcus (43.8% of all the sequences), Cladosporium (8.2%), Pyrenophora (7.4%) and Vagicola (6.3%). This study revealed knowledge of barley grain associated microbes of Norwegian barley that can be useful to control the malt quality. Germination affected both bacterial and fungal microbiota composition. No difference in bacterial microbiota composition was seen regarding cultivars and cultivation place, however, the fungal microbiota composition was significantly influenced by the cultivation place. Differences in fungal community of ungerminated and germinated barley samples of different geographical locations were more pronounced than differences in bacterial communities.
