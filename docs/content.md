Studies have suggested that the vaginal microbiome and gut microbiome are involved in pregnancy-related diseases, but little exploration of the link with early miscarriage or threatened miscarriage (TM) has been done. Whether the characteristics of the vaginal microbiome and gut microbiome in early pregnancy are related to TM and early pregnancy outcomes remains unclear.

The early life gut microbiome is crucial in maintaining host metabolic and immune homeostasis. Though neonates with critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) are at substantial risks of malnutrition and immune imbalance, the microbial links to CCHD pathophysiology remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the gut microbiome in neonates with CCHD in association with metabolomic traits. Moreover, we explored the clinical implications of the host-microbe interactions in CCHD.

_Humans, Archaea, Metagenome, Virome, Viruses, Metagenomics, Archaeal Viruses_
The human gut microbiome has been extensively explored, while the archaeal viruses remain largely unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the archaeal viruses from the human gut metagenomes and the existing virus collections using the CRISPR spacer and viral signature-based approach. This results in 1279 viral species, of which, 95.2% infect Methanobrevibacteria_A, 56.5% shared high identity (&gt;95%) with the archaeal proviruses, 37.2% have a host range across archaeal species, and 55.7% are highly prevalent in the human population (&gt;1%). A methanogenic archaeal virus-specific gene for pseudomurein endoisopeptidase (PeiW) frequently occurs in the viral sequences (n = 150). Analysis of 33 Caudoviricetes viruses with a complete genome often discovers the genes (integrase, n = 29; mazE, n = 10) regulating the viral lysogenic-lytic cycle, implying the dominance of temperate viruses in the archaeal virome. Together, our work uncovers the unexplored diversity of archaeal viruses, revealing the novel facet of the human gut microbiome.

The short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyric acid maintains a healthy gut barrier and vascular endothelium. We aimed to investigate the association between fecal butyric acid, carotid atherosclerosis and risk factors for ischemic stroke. Patients with severe carotid atherosclerosis (i.e. ≥ 50% stenosis) (n = 43) were compared with healthy controls (n = 38). We analyzed fecal SCFAs by gas chromatography, microbiota composition by 16S rRNA sequencing, markers of gut barrier damage and inflammasome activation by immunoassay, and plasma SCFAs by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. Patients had higher fecal butyric acid level (p = 0.024), along with increased functional potential of microbial butyric acid production (p = 0.031), compared with controls. Dietary fiber intake was comparable. Patients had higher levels of gut barrier damage markers CCL25 and IFABP, and the inflammasome activation marker IL-18, whereas plasma level of butyric was similar. Increased fecal butyric acid was associated with higher BMI, waist-hip ratio, HbA1c, CRP and leukocyte count. Contrary to our hypothesis, patients with severe carotid atherosclerosis had higher fecal butyric acid level, and increased microbial production, compared with controls. Gut barrier damage in patients might indicate decreased absorption of butyric acid and hence contribute to the higher fecal level.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is neurodegenerative disease with a multifactorial etiopathogenesis with accumulating evidence identifying microbiota as a potential factor in the earliest, prodromal phases of the disease. Previous research has already shown a significant difference between gut microbiota composition in PD patients as opposed to healthy controls, with a growing number of studies correlating gut microbiota changes with the clinical presentation of the disease in later stages, through various motor and non-motor symptoms. Our aim in this systematic review is to compose and assess current knowledge in the field and determine if the findings could influence future clinical practice as well as therapy in PD.

## A systematic review of microbiome-derived biomarkers for early colorectal cancer detection.
 25.12.2022, _FH Zwezerijnen-Jiwa, H Sivov, P Paizs, K Zafeiropoulou, J Kinross_


Increasing evidence suggests a role of the gut microbiome in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) and that it can serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis. This review aims to give an overview of the current status of published studies regarding the microbiome as a screening tool for early CRC detection. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE in August 2022. Studies assessing the efficacy of microbiome-derived biomarkers based on noninvasive derived samples were included. Not relevant studies or studies not specifying the stage of CRC or grouping them together in the analysis were excluded. The risk of bias for screening tools was performed using the QUADAS-2 checklist. A total of 28 studies were included, ranging from 2 to 462 for CRC and 18 to 665 advanced adenoma patient inclusions, of which only two investigated the co-metabolome as biomarker. The diagnostic performance of faecal bacteria-derived biomarkers had an AUC ranging from 0.28-0.98 for precursor lesions such as advanced adenomas and 0.54-0.89 for early CRC. Diagnostic performance based on the co-metabolome showed an AUC ranging from 0.69 - 0.84 for precursor lesions and 0.65 - 0.93 for early CRC. All models improved when combined with established clinical early detection markers such as gFOBT. A high level of heterogeneity was seen in the number of inclusions and methodology used in the studies. The faecal and oral gut microbiome has the potential to complement existing CRC screening tools, however current evidence suggests that this is not yet ready for routine clinical use.

## Prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities associated with coral species have high host specificity in the South China Sea.
 29.12.2022, _K Cheng, M Tong, Z Cai, MC Jong, J Zhou, B Xiao_


Reef-building corals are well known for their obligate association with Symbiodiniaceae, and an array of other microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and symbiotic algae (i.e., total microbiome), which together form the coral holobiont. The total microbiome plays an intricate part in maintaining the homeostasis of the coral holobiont and is closely associated with host health. However, the composition of the coral associated microbiome and interaction between its different members remains elusive because few analyses have bridged taxonomically disparate groups. This research gaps have prevented a holistic understanding of the total microbiome. Thus, to simultaneously characterize the bacterial, fungal and symbiotic algal communities associated with different coral species, and explore the relationship between these symbionts and coral health, healthy and bleached tissues from four coral species, Acropora muricata, Galaxea fascicularis, Platygyra daedalea, and Pavona explanulata, were collected from the Xisha Islands of the South China Sea. Using high throughput sequencing, a high degree of host-specificity was observed among bacterial, fungal, and algal groups across coral species. There were no obvious changes in the microbial community structure of apparently healthy and bleached corals, but host bleaching allowed colonization of the holobionts by diverse opportunistic microbes, resulting in a significant elevation in the α-diversity of microbial communities. In addition, co-occurrence analysis of the coral microbiota also identified more complex microbial interactions in bleached corals than in healthy ones. In summary, this study characterized the structure of coral-associated microbiomes across four coral species, and systematically studied microbiome differences between healthy and bleached corals. The findings improve our understanding of the heterogeneity of symbiotic microorganisms and the impact of coral's physiological status on its associated microbial communities composition.

## Degradation pathways for organic matter of terrestrial origin are widespread and expressed in Arctic Ocean microbiomes.
 30.12.2022, _T Grevesse, C Guéguen, VE Onana, DA Walsh_


_Humic Substances, Oceans and Seas, Bacteria, Carbon, Microbiota_
The Arctic Ocean receives massive freshwater input and a correspondingly large amount of humic-rich organic matter of terrestrial origin. Global warming, permafrost melt, and a changing hydrological cycle will contribute to an intensification of terrestrial organic matter release to the Arctic Ocean. Although considered recalcitrant to degradation due to complex aromatic structures, humic substances can serve as substrate for microbial growth in terrestrial environments. However, the capacity of marine microbiomes to process aromatic-rich humic substances, and how this processing may contribute to carbon and nutrient cycling in a changing Arctic Ocean, is relatively unexplored. Here, we used a combination of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to assess the prevalence and diversity of metabolic pathways and bacterial taxa involved in aromatic compound degradation in the salinity-stratified summer waters of the Canada Basin in the western Arctic Ocean.

Plants are found in a large percentage of indoor environments, yet the potential for bacteria associated with indoor plant leaves and soil to colonize human skin remains unclear. We report results of experiments in a controlled climate chamber to characterize bacterial communities inhabiting the substrates and leaves of five indoor plant species, and quantify microbial transfer dynamics and residence times on human skin following simulated touch contact events. Controlled bacterial propagule transfer events with soil and leaf donors were applied to the arms of human occupants and repeatedly measured over a 24-h period using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.

The rapid and accurate identification of a minimal-size core set of representative microbial species plays an important role in the clustering of microbial community data and interpretation of clustering results. However, the huge dimensionality of microbial metagenomics datasets is a major challenge for the existing methods such as Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) models. In the approach of the existing methods, the computational burden of identifying a small number of representative species from a large number of observed species remains a challenge.
