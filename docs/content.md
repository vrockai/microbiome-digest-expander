## Viral Infection-Induced Gut Dysbiosis, Neuroinflammation, and α-Synuclein Aggregation: Updates and Perspectives on COVID-19 and Neurodegenerative Disorders.
 27.11.2020, _C Follmer_


The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gained increased attention in the neuroscience community, especially taking into account the neuroinvasive potential of its causative agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the impact of its infection on the structure and function of the brain. Apart from the neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2, it is likewise important the observation that virus infection may perturb specific cellular processes that are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of diverse neurological disorders, particularly in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this scenario, viral infection-induced colon inflammation, gut microbial imbalance, and α-synuclein upregulation are of particular interest with regard to the interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system (microbiome-gut-brain axis). In this Perspective, we present a critical view on the different hypotheses that are recently being raised by neuroscientists about the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and long-lasting neurodegenerative disorders, opening the question of whether COVID-19 might represent a risk factor for the development of PD.

## Dual and mutual interaction between microbiota and viral infections: a possible treat for COVID-19.
 29.11.2020, _T Baghbani, H Nikzad, J Azadbakht, F Izadpanah, H Haddad Kashani_


All of humans and other mammalian species are colonized by some types of microorganisms such as bacteria, archaea, unicellular eukaryotes like fungi and protozoa, multicellular eukaryotes like helminths, and viruses, which in whole are called microbiota. These microorganisms have multiple different types of interaction with each other. A plethora of evidence suggests that they can regulate immune and digestive systems and also play roles in various diseases, such as mental, cardiovascular, metabolic and some skin diseases. In addition, they take-part in some current health problems like diabetes mellitus, obesity, cancers and infections. Viral infection is one of the most common and problematic health care issues, particularly in recent years that pandemics like SARS and COVID-19 caused a lot of financial and physical damage to the world. There are plenty of articles investigating the interaction between microbiota and infectious diseases. We focused on stimulatory to suppressive effects of microbiota on viral infections, hoping to find a solution to overcome this current pandemic. Then we reviewed mechanistically the effects of both microbiota and probiotics on most of the viruses. But unlike previous studies which concentrated on intestinal microbiota and infection, our focus is on respiratory system's microbiota and respiratory viral infection, bearing in mind that respiratory system is a proper entry site and residence for viruses, and whereby infection, can lead to asymptomatic, mild, self-limiting, severe or even fatal infection. Finally, we overgeneralize the effects of microbiota on COVID-19 infection. In addition, we reviewed the articles about effects of the microbiota on coronaviruses and suggest some new therapeutic measures.

## Gut microbiome is more stable in males than in females during the development of colorectal cancer.
 27.11.2020, _H Liao, C Li, Y Ai, Y Kou_


Gut microbial alterations have great potential to predict the development of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, how gut microbes respond to the development of CRC in males and females at the community level is unknown. We aim to investigate the differences of gut microbiota between the male and female.

## Expression of toll-like and adhesive receptors on epithelial cells of the oral mucosa in periodontitis.
 27.11.2020, _OA Lukova, MI Zaslavskaya, TV Makhrova, VS Kropotov, EV Kitaeva_


The expression of toll-like and adhesive receptors on epithelial cells of the oral mucosa changes in different pathological conditions, both local and systemic levels, in particular, in chronic periodontitis. The long-term presence of periodontal pathogenic microorganisms in the gingival furrow stimulates and supports the inflammatory process. The interaction of periodontal pathogens with epithelial cells of the oral mucosa is the first stage of the development of periodontitis. The pathological process affects the function of epithelial cells, in particular their ability to interact with representatives of microbiocenosis. Therefore, the natural colonization of normal oral microbiota on buccal epitheliocytes, reflecting the ability of epithelial cells to microbial adhesion, is a sensitive indicator of various destabilizing processes. Determining the level of expression of toll-like TLR2 and TLR4 receptors on epithelial cells also allows us to assess the functional state of cells and the severity of the inflammatory process at the level of the oral mucosa, in particular, in chronic periodontitis. In this paper, we studied the receptor-dependent reactions of buccal epithelial cells in chronic periodontitis using flow cytofluorometry and by determining the level of natural (microbial) colonization. The authors also compared these methods for determining the functional state of mucosal cells in chronic periodontitis. The results showed that in patients with periodontitis, the activity of receptors involved in adhesive reactions with the oral microbiota changed slightly and was little higher than in healthy donors. At the same time, the expression of TLRs on epithelial cells in periodontitis changed significantly. Thus, the percentage of cells expressing TLR2 significantly increased, while TLR4 decreased. Concurrently, the percentage of mucosal cells that do not have TLRs increased significantly in oral pathology. Thus, the study of TLR2 - and TLR4-expression on buccal epithelial cells is a more representative test in assessing the severity of the inflammatory process in chronic periodontitis than determining the level of natural colonization.

## The Microbiome in Hidradenitis Suppurativa: A Review.
 27.11.2020, _KJL Wark, GD Cains_


Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic autoinflammatory skin disease. It is characterised by the development of abscesses and nodules in intertriginous anatomical sites. Whilst it is now recognised as an autoinflammatory condition rather than an infective disease, bacteria are implicated in disease pathogenesis.

## Evaluation of the upper airway microbiome and immune response with nasal epithelial lining fluid absorption and nasal washes.
 27.11.2020, _MH Shilts, C Rosas-Salazar, CE Lynch, A Tovchigrechko, HH Boone, PB Russell, AS Connolly, KM Costello, MD McCollum, A Mai, DA Wiggins, SV Rajagopala, S Yooseph, RS Peebles, TV Hartert, SR Das_


Despite being commonly used to collect upper airway epithelial lining fluid, nasal washes are poorly reproducible, not suitable for serial sampling, and limited by a dilution effect. In contrast, nasal filters lack these limitations and are an attractive alternative. To examine whether nasal filters are superior to nasal washes as a sampling method for the characterization of the upper airway microbiome and immune response, we collected paired nasal filters and washes from a group of 40 healthy children and adults. To characterize the upper airway microbiome, we used 16S ribosomal RNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. To characterize the immune response, we measured total protein using a BCA assay and 53 immune mediators using multiplex magnetic bead-based assays. We conducted statistical analyses to compare common microbial ecology indices and immune-mediator median fluorescence intensities (MFIs) between sample types. In general, nasal filters were more likely to pass quality control in both children and adults. There were no significant differences in microbiome community richness, α-diversity, or structure between pediatric samples types; however, these were all highly dissimilar between adult sample types. In addition, there were significant differences in the abundance of amplicon sequence variants between sample types in children and adults. In adults, total proteins were significantly higher in nasal filters than nasal washes; consequently, the immune-mediator MFIs were not well detected in nasal washes. Based on better quality control sequencing metrics and higher immunoassay sensitivity, our results suggest that nasal filters are a superior sampling method to characterize the upper airway microbiome and immune response in both children and adults.

## Emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles by enterotype.
 29.11.2020, _SH Lee, SH Yoon, Y Jung, N Kim, U Min, J Chun, I Choi_


With increasing attention being paid to improving emotional well-being, recent evidence points to gut microbiota as a key player in regulating mental and physical health via bidirectional communication between the brain and gut. Here, we examine the association between emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles (i.e., gut microbiome composition, diversity, and the moderating role of the enterotypes) among healthy Korean adults (n = 83, mean age = 48.9, SD = 13.2). The research was performed using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to obtain gut microbiome profiles, as well as a self-report survey that included the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The cluster-based analysis identified two enterotypes dominated by the genera Bacteroides (n = 49) and Prevotella (n = 34). Generalized linear regression analysis reveals significant associations between positive emotion and gut microbiome diversity (Shannon Index) among participants in the Prevotella dominant group, whereas no such relationship emerged among participants in the Bacteroides group. Moreover, a novel genus from the family Lachnospiraceae is associated with emotional well-being scores, both positive and negative. Together, the current findings highlight the enterotype-specific links between the gut microbiota community and emotion in healthy adults and suggest the possible roles of the gut microbiome in promoting mental health.

## Vitamin D metabolites and the gut microbiome in older men.
 29.11.2020, _RL Thomas, L Jiang, JS Adams, ZZ Xu, J Shen, S Janssen, G Ackermann, D Vanderschueren, S Pauwels, R Knight, ES Orwoll, DM Kado_


The vitamin D receptor is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract where it transacts gene expression. With current limited understanding of the interactions between the gut microbiome and vitamin D, we conduct a cross-sectional analysis of 567 older men quantifying serum vitamin D metabolites using LC-MSMS and defining stool sub-Operational Taxonomic Units from16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing data. Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity and non-redundant covariate analyses reveal that the serum 1,25(OH)2D level explains 5% of variance in α-diversity. In β-diversity analyses using unweighted UniFrac, 1,25(OH)2D is the strongest factor assessed, explaining 2% of variance. Random forest analyses identify 12 taxa, 11 in the phylum Firmicutes, eight of which are positively associated with either 1,25(OH)2D and/or the hormone-to-prohormone [1,25(OH)2D/25(OH)D] "activation ratio." Men with higher levels of 1,25(OH)2D and higher activation ratios, but not 25(OH)D itself, are more likely to possess butyrate producing bacteria that are associated with better gut microbial health.

## Reduced rotavirus vaccine efficacy in protein malnourished human-faecal-microbiota-transplanted gnotobiotic pig model is in part attributed to the gut microbiota.
 27.11.2020, _V Srivastava, L Deblais, HC Huang, A Miyazaki, S Kandasamy, SN Langel, FC Paim, J Chepngeno, D Kathayat, AN Vlasova, LJ Saif, G Rajashekara_


The low efficacy of human rotavirus (HRV) vaccines in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) remains a major challenge for global health. Protein-calorie malnutrition (kwashiorkor) affects the gut microbiota and compromises immune development, leading to environmental enteropathy, vaccine failures, and increased susceptibility to enteric diseases in young children. Relationship between diet and reduced vaccine efficacy in developing countries is not well established; therefore, we investigated the interconnections between the host-microbiota-nutrition-HRV vaccine using HRV-vaccinated, human infant faecal microbiota (HIFM)-transplanted neonatal gnotobiotic pigs fed with a protein deficient or sufficient diet. The microbiota from faecal, intestinal (duodenum, ileum, jejunum, and colon), and systemic tissue (liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node [MLN]) samples was analysed before and after HRV challenge using MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing. Overall, microbiota from deficient fed HIFM pigs displayed, compared to the sufficient group, significantly higher Shannon index, especially in the faeces and lower intestines; higher level of Proteus and Enterococcus, and lower level of Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, and Streptococcus in the three types of samples collected (P&lt;0.05); and higher unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs), especially in the systemic tissues. Further, the multivariate analysis between microbiota and immunologic data showed that 38 OTUs at the genus level correlated (r2≤0.5 or ≥-0.5; P&lt;0.05) with at least one host immune response parameter (regulatory [Tregs and transforming growth factor-β], effectors [interferon (IFN)-γ+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IFN-γ and interleukin (IL)-12], and inflammatory [tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-17 and IL-22]) and with opposite trends between diet groups. Differences described above were increased after HRV challenge. We demonstrated that a protein deficient diet affects the composition of the gut microbiota and those changes may further correlate with immune responses induced by HRV and perturbed by the deficient diet. Thus, our findings suggest that the reduced efficacy of HRV vaccine observed in Gn pig model is in part attributed to the altered microbiota composition.

Covering: up to the end of 2020.The machine learning field can be defined as the study and application of algorithms that perform classification and prediction tasks through pattern recognition instead of explicitly defined rules. Among other areas, machine learning has excelled in natural language processing. As such methods have excelled at understanding written languages (e.g. English), they are also being applied to biological problems to better understand the "genomic language". In this review we focus on recent advances in applying machine learning to natural products and genomics, and how those advances are improving our understanding of natural product biology, chemistry, and drug discovery. We discuss machine learning applications in genome mining (identifying biosynthetic signatures in genomic data), predictions of what structures will be created from those genomic signatures, and the types of activity we might expect from those molecules. We further explore the application of these approaches to data derived from complex microbiomes, with a focus on the human microbiome. We also review challenges in leveraging machine learning approaches in the field, and how the availability of other "omics" data layers provides value. Finally, we provide insights into the challenges associated with interpreting machine learning models and the underlying biology and promises of applying machine learning to natural product drug discovery. We believe that the application of machine learning methods to natural product research is poised to accelerate the identification of new molecular entities that may be used to treat a variety of disease indications.

## Efficient protection of microorganisms for delivery to the intestinal tract by cellulose sulphate encapsulation.
 27.11.2020, _WH Gunzburg, MM Aung, P Toa, S Ng, E Read, WJ Tan, EM Brandtner, J Dangerfield, B Salmons_


Gut microbiota in humans and animals play an important role in health, aiding in digestion, regulation of the immune system and protection against pathogens. Changes or imbalances in the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) have been linked to a variety of local and systemic diseases, and there is growing evidence that restoring the balance of the microbiota by delivery of probiotic microorganisms can improve health. However, orally delivered probiotic microorganisms must survive transit through lethal highly acid conditions of the stomach and bile salts in the small intestine. Current methods to protect probiotic microorganisms are still not effective enough.
