The escalating global prevalence of depression demands effective therapeutic strategies, with psychobiotics emerging as a promising solution. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the neurobehavioral impact of psychobiotics remain elusive. This study reveals a significant reduction in hippocampal indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) levels in depressed mice, which is ameliorated by the psychobiotic Bifidobacterium breve. In both human subjects and mice, the ILA increase in the circulatory system results from bifidobacteria supplementation. Further investigation identifies the key aromatic lactate dehydrogenase (Aldh) gene and pathway in bifidobacteria responsible for ILA production. Importantly, the antidepressant effects are nullified in the Aldh mutants compared to the wild-type strain. At the bifidobacteria species level, those with Aldh exhibit heightened antidepressant effects. Finally, this study emphasizes the antidepressant efficacy of psychobiotic-derived ILA, potentially mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling activation to alleviate neuroinflammation. This study unveils the molecular and genetic foundations of psychobiotics' antidepressant effects, offering insights for microbial therapies targeting mood disorders.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) improve outcomes in advanced melanoma, but many patients are refractory or experience relapse. The gut microbiota modulates antitumor responses. However, inconsistent baseline predictors point to heterogeneity in responses and inadequacy of cross-sectional data. We followed patients with unresectable melanoma from baseline and during anti-PD-1 therapy, collecting fecal and blood samples that were surveyed for changes in the gut microbiota and immune markers. Varying patient responses were linked to different gut microbiota dynamics during ICI treatment. We select complete responders by their stable microbiota functions and validate them using multiple external cohorts and experimentally. We identify major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I)-restricted peptides derived from flagellin-related genes of Lachnospiraceae (FLach) as structural homologs of tumor-associated antigens, detect FLach-reactive CD8+ T cells in complete responders before ICI therapy, and demonstrate that FLach peptides improve antitumor immunity. These findings highlight the prognostic value of microbial functions and therapeutic potential of tumor-mimicking microbial peptides.

## Exclusive enteral nutrition initiates individual protective microbiome changes to induce remission in pediatric Crohn's disease.
 26.10.2024, _D Häcker, K Siebert, BJ Smith, N Köhler, A Riva, A Mahapatra, H Heimes, J Nie, A Metwaly, H Hölz, Q Manz, F De Zen, J Heetmeyer, K Socas, G Le Thi, C Meng, K Kleigrewe, JK Pauling, K Neuhaus, M List, KS Pollard, T Schwerd, D Haller_


Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line therapy for pediatric Crohn's disease (CD), but protective mechanisms remain unknown. We established a prospective pediatric cohort to characterize the function of fecal microbiota and metabolite changes of treatment-naive CD patients in response to EEN (German Clinical Trials DRKS00013306). Integrated multi-omics analysis identified network clusters from individually variable microbiome profiles, with Lachnospiraceae and medium-chain fatty acids as protective features. Bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging selectively identified bacterial species in response to medium-chain fatty acids. Metagenomic analysis identified high strain-level dynamics in response to EEN. Functional changes in diet-exposed fecal microbiota were further validated using gut chemostat cultures and microbiota transfer into germ-free Il10-deficient mice. Dietary model conditions induced individual patient-specific strain signatures to prevent or cause inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-like inflammation in gnotobiotic mice. Hence, we provide evidence that EEN therapy operates through explicit functional changes of temporally and individually variable microbiome profiles.

_Probiotics, Prebiotics, Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Diet, Clinical Trials as Topic, Research Design_
Diet is a major determinant of the gastrointestinal microbiome composition and function, yet our understanding of how it impacts the efficacy of prebiotics and probiotics is limited. Here we examine current evidence of dietary influence on prebiotic and probiotic efficacy in human studies, including potential mechanisms. We propose that habitual diet be included as a variable in prebiotic and probiotic intervention studies. This recommendation is based on the potential mechanisms via which diet can affect study outcomes, either directly or through the gut microbiome. We consider the challenges and opportunities of dietary assessment in this context. Lastly, we provide recommendations for the design, conduct and reporting of human clinical trials of prebiotics and probiotics (and other biotic interventions) to account for any effect of diet and nutrition.

Bacteria are fascinating research objects in many disciplines for countless reasons, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has become the paramount methodology to advance our microbiological understanding. Meanwhile, access to cost-effective sequencing platforms has accelerated bacterial WGS to unprecedented levels, introducing new challenges in terms of data accessibility, computational demands, heterogeneity of analysis workflows and, thus, ultimately its scientific usability. To this end, a previous study released a uniformly processed set of 661 405 bacterial genome assemblies obtained from the European Nucleotide Archive as of November 2018. Building on these accomplishments, we conducted further genome-based analyses like taxonomic classification, multilocus sequence typing and annotation of all genomes. Here, we present BakRep, a searchable large-scale web repository of these genomes enriched with consistent genome characterizations and original metadata. The platform provides a flexible search engine combining taxonomic, genomic and metadata information, as well as interactive elements to visualize genomic features. Furthermore, all results can be downloaded for offline analyses via an accompanying command line tool. The web repository is accessible via https://bakrep.computational.bio.

## A long-context language model for deciphering and generating bacteriophage genomes.
 01.11.2024, _B Shao, J Yan_


_Genome, Viral, Bacteriophages, Computational Biology_
Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we develop a long-context generative model for genomes. Our multiscale transformer model, megaDNA, is pre-trained on unannotated bacteriophage genomes with nucleotide-level tokenization. We demonstrate the foundational capabilities of our model including the prediction of essential genes, genetic variant effects, regulatory element activity and taxonomy of unannotated sequences. Furthermore, it generates de novo sequences up to 96 K base pairs, which contain potential regulatory elements and annotated proteins with phage-related functions.

## Prototol for the Prospective Sample Collection for Cancer of Bladder (ProCaB) Trial by the Cancer of the Bladder Leuven (CaBLe) Consortium.

Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a heterogeneous disease categorized as low, intermediate, high, or very high risk, for which recurrence and progression rates and thus management strategies differ. Current molecular subclassification of bladder cancer (BC) is mainly based on data for muscle-invasive disease, with very few data for NMIBC. A more accurate classification system is needed for better stratification of NMIBC using multiomics and immunohistopathological molecular data alongside clinical data collected in a prospective cohort. ProCaB (Prospective Sample Collection for Cancer of Bladder) is a single-center non-interventional, prospective study recruiting all eligible patients diagnosed with BC in a tertiary center in the Flanders region of Belgium. Clinical data have been collected in a prospective registry since August 2013. Biosamples (blood, urine, and BC tissue) are collected from each patient at diagnosis and are stored at -80°C at BioBank UZ Leuven after appropriate processing according to the protocol. Multiomics (genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics) and immunohistopathology analyses will be performed on appropriate samples. The target is to enroll 300 patients over a 5-yr period, and all patients will be followed for 5 yr. The objective is to create a biobank of samples from patients diagnosed with BC for use in multiomics and immunohistopathological analyses. Results from these analyses, together with long-term clinical data, can be used for comprehensive multilayered molecular characterization of disease recurrence and progression in intermediate- and (very) high-risk NMIBC, identification of multibiomarker panels for better stratification, and identification of a patient subgroup that does not respond to bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT04167332.

An estimated 65 million people globally suffer from post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), with many experiencing cardiovascular symptoms (PASC-CVS) like chest pain and heart palpitations. This study examines the role of chronic inflammation in PASC-CVS, particularly in individuals with symptoms persisting over a year after infection. Blood samples from three groups-recovered individuals, those with prolonged PASC-CVS and SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals-revealed that those with PASC-CVS had a blood signature linked to inflammation. Trace-level pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected in the plasma from donors with PASC-CVS 18 months post infection using nanotechnology. Importantly, these trace-level cytokines affected the function of primary human cardiomyocytes. Plasma proteomics also demonstrated higher levels of complement and coagulation proteins in the plasma from patients with PASC-CVS. This study highlights chronic inflammation's role in the symptoms of PASC-CVS.
