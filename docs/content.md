## Lactic acid-containing products for bacterial vaginosis and their impact on the vaginal microbiota: A systematic review.
 20.02.2021, _EL Plummer, CS Bradshaw, M Doyle, CK Fairley, GL Murray, D Bateson, L Masson, J Slifirski, G Tachedjian, LA Vodstrcil_


The vaginal microbiota in bacterial vaginosis (BV) typically has low abundance of lactic acid producing lactobacilli. Lactic acid has properties that may make it effective for treating BV and/or restoring an optimal lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota. We conducted a systematic review to describe the effect of intravaginal lactic acid-containing products on BV cure, and their impact on vaginal microbiota composition (PROSPERO registration: CRD42018115982).

## Effects of colon-targeted vitamins on the composition and metabolic activity of the human gut microbiome- a pilot study.
 22.02.2021, _VT Pham, S Fehlbaum, N Seifert, N Richard, MJ Bruins, W Sybesma, A Rehman, RE Steinert_


An increasing body of evidence has shown that gut microbiota imbalances are linked to diseases. Currently, the possibility of regulating gut microbiota to reverse these perturbations by developing novel therapeutic and preventive strategies is being extensively investigated. The modulatory effect of vitamins on the gut microbiome and related host health benefits remain largely unclear. We investigated the effects of colon-delivered vitamins A, B2, C, D, and E on the gut microbiota using a human clinical study and batch fermentation experiments, in combination with cell models for the assessment of barrier and immune functions. Vitamins C, B2, and D may modulate the human gut microbiome in terms of metabolic activity and bacterial composition. The most distinct effect was that of vitamin C, which significantly increased microbial alpha diversity and fecal short-chain fatty acids compared to the placebo. The remaining vitamins tested showed similar effects on microbial diversity, composition, and/or metabolic activity in vitro, but in varying degrees. Here, we showed that vitamins may modulate the human gut microbiome. Follow-up studies investigating targeted delivery of vitamins to the colon may help clarify the clinical significance of this novel concept for treating and preventing dysbiotic microbiota-related human diseases.

## Co-infecting pathogen lineages have additive effects on host bacterial communities.
 13.02.2021, _D Medina, SE Greenspan, T Carvalho, CG Becker, LF Toledo_


Amphibian skin bacteria may confer protection against the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), but responses of skin bacteria to different Bd lineages are poorly understood. The global panzootic lineage (Bd-GPL) has caused amphibian declines and extinctions globally. However, other lineages are enzootic (Bd-Asia-2/Brazil). Increased contact rates between Bd-GPL and enzootic lineages via globalization pose unknown consequences for host-microbiome-pathogen dynamics. We conducted a laboratory experiment and used 16S rRNA amplicon-sequencing to assess: 1) whether two lineages (Bd-Asia-2/Brazil and Bd-GPL) and their recombinant, in single and mixed infections, differentially affect amphibian skin bacteria; 2) and the changes associated with the transition to laboratory conditions. We determined no clear differences in bacterial diversity among Bd treatments, despite differences in infection intensity. However, we observed an additive effect of mixed infections on bacterial alpha diversity and a potentially antagonistic interaction between Bd genotypes. Additionally, observed changes in community composition suggest a higher ability of Bd-GPL to alter skin bacteria. Lastly, we observed a drastic reduction in bacterial diversity and a change in community structure in laboratory conditions. We provide evidence for complex interactions between Bd genotypes and amphibian skin bacteria during coinfections, and expand on the implications of experimental conditions in ecological studies.

## A DNA metabarcoding approach for recovering plankton communities from archived samples fixed in formalin.
 17.02.2021, _T Shiozaki, F Itoh, Y Hirose, J Onodera, A Kuwata, N Harada_


Plankton samples have been routinely collected and preserved in formalin in many laboratories and museums for more than 100 years. Recently, attention has turned to use DNA information from formalin-fixed samples to examine changes in plankton diversity over time. However, no molecular ecological studies have evaluated the impact of formalin fixation on the genetic composition of the plankton community structure. Here, we developed a method for extracting DNA from archived formalin-preserved plankton samples to determine their community structure by a DNA metabarcoding approach. We found that a lysis solution consisting of borate-NaOH buffer (pH 11) with SDS and proteinase K effectively cleaved the cross-link formed by formalin fixation. DNA was extracted from samples preserved for decades in formalin, and the diatom community of the extracted DNA was in good agreement with the microscopy analysis. Furthermore, we stored a plankton sample for 1.5 years and demonstrated that 18S rRNA gene community structures did not change significantly from non-formalin-fixed, time-zero samples. These results indicate that our method can be used to describe the original community structure of plankton archived in formalin for years. Our approach will be useful for examining the long-term variation of plankton diversity by metabarcoding analysis of 18S rRNA gene community structure.

## Are permafrost microorganisms as old as permafrost?
 18.02.2021, _A Abramov, T Vishnivetskaya, E Rivkina_


Permafrost describes the condition of earth material (sand, ground, organic matter, etc.) cemented by ice when its temperature remains at or below 0Â°C continuously for longer than 2 years. Evidently, permafrost is as old as the time passed from freezing of the earth material. Permafrost is a unique phenomenon and may preserve life forms it encloses. Therefore, in order to talk confidently about the preservation of paleo-objects in permafrost, knowledge about the geological age of sediments, i.e. when the sediments were formed, and permafrost age, when those sediments became permanently frozen, is essential. There are two types of permafrost-syngenetic and epigenetic. The age of syngenetic permafrost corresponds to the geological age of its sediments, whereas the age of epigenetic permafrost is less than the geological age of its sediments. Both of these formations preserve microorganisms and their metabolic products; however, the interpretations of the microbiological and molecular-biological data are inconsistent. This paper reviews the current knowledge of time-temperature history and age of permafrost in relation to available microbiological and metagenomic data.

## Cultivation and characterization of snowbound microorganisms from the South Pole.
 16.02.2021, _MK Hayward, ED Dewey, KN Shaffer, AM Huntington, BM Burchell, LM Stokes, BC Alexander, JE George, ML Kempher, SB Joye, MT Madigan, WM Sattley_


Little is known about microbial ecosystems of interior Antarctica, if indeed such ecosystems exist. Although considerable research has assessed microorganisms indigenous to coastal regions of Antarctica, particularly their lakes, ponds, and soils, to our knowledge only one characterized bacterium, a strain of Pseudomonas, has been isolated from South Pole ice or snow. Metagenomic community analyses described in this work and elsewhere reveal that a diversity of bacteria exists in inland polar snows, yet attempts to culture and characterize these microbes from this extreme environment have been few to date. In this molecular and culture-dependent investigation of the microbiology of inland Antarctica, we enriched and isolated two new strains of bacteria and one strain of yeast (Fungi) from South Pole snow samples. The bacteria were of the genera Methylobacterium and Sphingomonas, and the yeast grouped with species of Naganishia (class Tremellocytes). In addition to phylogenetic analyses, characterization of these isolates included determinations of cell morphology, growth as a function of temperature, salinity tolerance, and carbon and energy source versatility. All organisms were found to be cold-adapted, and the yeast strain additionally showed considerable halotolerance. These descriptions expand our understanding of the diversity and metabolic activities of snowbound microorganisms of interior Antarctica.
