We aimed to investigate whether the gut microbiota and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with skeletal muscle mass and strength in healthy Chinese children aged 6-9 years. In this study, 412 children were enrolled. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the gut microbiota compositions. Fecal SCFAs were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Dual X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure the total body lean soft tissue mass (TSM), total body fat mass (TBF), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), and appendicular fat mass (AFM). TSM/height2 (TSMI), ASM/height2 (ASMI), TSM/weight (TSMR), ASM/weight (ASMR), and the ratio of TSM/TBF and ASM/AFM were calculated. Handgrip strength (HGS) was measured using the Jamar® Plus+ Hand Dynamometer. A multiple regression analysis after adjustment for covariates and multiple test correction showed some operational taxonomic units in partial least squares models identified by Multivariate methods with Unbiased Variable selection analysis such as genera of Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-004 were positively correlated with at least one measure of TSM, TSMI, ASM, ASMI, and ASMI Z-score (β: 0.103-0.143, pFDR : .008-.032) but negatively correlated with at least one measure of TSMR, TSM/TBF, ASMR, ASM/AFM, and ASMR Z-score (β: -0.185 to 0.124, pFDR = .008-.045). Children with higher fecal butyric acid, acetic acid, and total SCFA levels exhibited higher TSM, ASM, TSMI, ASMI, and ASMI Z-score and lower TSM/TBF, ASM/AFM, TSMR, ASMR, and ASMR Z-score. However, after additional adjustment for TBF or body mass index, only the associations for Faecalitalea and Pyramidobacter still existed. Mediation analysis suggested that total body fat significantly mediated 66.3%-95.3% of the estimated association of microbiota and SCFAs with TSM, ASM, and ASMI Z-score. Our results suggest that the associations of gut microbiota and SCFAs with skeletal muscle quality in children may largely depend upon on total body fat content.

## Characteristics of Fecal Microbiota and Machine Learning Strategy for Fecal Invasive Biomarkers in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
 25.12.2021, _X Wang, Y Xiao, X Xu, L Guo, Y Yu, N Li, C Xu_


Early diagnosis and treatment of pediatric Inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) is challenging due to the complexity of the disease and lack of disease specific biomarkers. The novel machine learning (ML) technique may be a useful tool to provide a new route for the identification of early biomarkers for the diagnosis of PIBD.

## Gut Microbiota Exceeds Cervical Microbiota for Early Diagnosis of Endometriosis.
 25.12.2021, _L Huang, B Liu, Z Liu, W Feng, M Liu, Y Wang, D Peng, X Fu, H Zhu, Z Cui, L Xie, Y Ma_


The diagnosis of endometriosis is typically delayed by years for the unexclusive symptom and the traumatic diagnostic method. Several studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota and cervical mucus potentially can be used as auxiliary diagnostic biomarkers. However, none of the previous studies has compared the robustness of endometriosis classifiers based on microbiota of different body sites or demonstrated the correlation among microbiota of gut, cervical mucus, and peritoneal fluid of endometriosis, searching for alternative diagnostic approaches. Herein, we enrolled 41 women (control, n = 20; endometriosis, n = 21) and collected 122 well-matched samples, derived from feces, cervical mucus, and peritoneal fluid, to explore the nature of microbiome of endometriosis patients. Our results indicated that microbial composition is remarkably distinguished between three body sites, with 19 overlapped taxa. Moreover, endometriosis patients harbor distinct microbial communities versus control group especially in feces and peritoneal fluid, with increased abundance of pathogens in peritoneal fluid and depletion of protective microbes in feces. Particularly, genera of Ruminococcus and Pseudomonas were identified as potential biomarkers in gut and peritoneal fluid, respectively. Furthermore, novel endometriosis classifiers were constructed based on taxa selected by a robust machine learning method. These results demonstrated that gut microbiota exceeds cervical microbiota in diagnosing endometriosis. Collectively, this study reveals important insights into the microbial profiling in different body sites of endometriosis, which warrant future exploration into the role of microbiota in endometriosis and highlighted values on gut microbiota in early diagnosis of endometriosis.

## Natural selection for imprecise vertical transmission in host-microbiota systems.
 24.12.2021, _M Bruijning, LP Henry, SKG Forsberg, CJE Metcalf, JF Ayroles_


How and when the microbiome modulates host adaptation remains an evolutionary puzzle, despite evidence that the extended genetic repertoire of the microbiome can shape host phenotypes and fitness. One complicating factor is that the microbiome is often transmitted imperfectly across host generations, leading to questions about the degree to which the microbiome contributes to host adaptation. Here, using an evolutionary model, we demonstrate that decreasing vertical transmission fidelity can increase microbiome variation, and thus phenotypic variation, across hosts. When the most beneficial microbial genotypes change unpredictably from one generation to the next (for example, in variable environments), hosts can maximize fitness by increasing the microbiome variation among offspring, as this improves the chance of there being an offspring with the right microbial combination for the next generation. Imperfect vertical transmission can therefore be adaptive in varying environments. We characterize how selection on vertical transmission is shaped by environmental conditions, microbiome changes during host development and the contribution of other factors to trait variation. We illustrate how environmentally dependent microbial effects can favour intermediate transmission and set our results in the context of examples from natural systems. We also suggest research avenues to empirically test our predictions. Our model provides a basis to understand the evolutionary pathways that potentially led to the wide diversity of microbe transmission patterns found in nature.

## Comparison of the airway microbiota in children with chronic suppurative lung disease.
 24.12.2021, _B Ahmed, MJ Cox, L Cuthbertson, P James, L Gardner, W Cookson, J Davies, M Moffatt, A Bush_


The airway microbiota is important in chronic suppurative lung diseases, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF). This comparison has not previously been described but is important because difference between the two diseases may relate to the differing prognoses and lead to pathological insights and potentially, new treatments.

## Site and land-use associations of soil bacteria and fungi define core and indicative taxa.
 23.12.2021, _G Florian, H Martin, M Johanna, H Anna-Sofia, E Jürg, G Andreas, M Reto G, F Beat, W Franco_


Soil microbial diversity has major influences on ecosystem functions and services. However, due to its complexity and uneven distribution of abundant and rare taxa, quantification of soil microbial diversity remains challenging and thereby impeding its integration into long-term monitoring programs. Using metabarcoding, we analyzed soil bacterial and fungal communities at thirty long-term soil monitoring sites from the three land-use types arable land, permanent grassland, and forest with a yearly sampling between snowmelt and first fertilization over five years. Unlike soil microbial biomass and alpha-diversity, microbial community compositions and structures were site- and land-use-specific with CAP reclassification success rates of 100%. The temporally stable site core communities included 38.5% of bacterial and 33.1% of fungal OTUs covering 95.9% and 93.2% of relative abundances. We characterized bacterial and fungal core communities and their land-use associations at the family-level. In general, fungal families revealed stronger land-use associations as compared to bacteria. This is likely due to a stronger vegetation effect on fungal core taxa, while bacterial core taxa were stronger related to soil properties. The assessment of core communities can be used to form cultivation-independent reference lists of microbial taxa, which may facilitate the development of microbial indicators for soil quality and the use of soil microbiota for long-term soil biomonitoring.

## tascCODA: Bayesian Tree-Aggregated Analysis of Compositional Amplicon and Single-Cell Data.
 25.12.2021, _J Ostner, S Carcy, CL Müller_


Accurate generative statistical modeling of count data is of critical relevance for the analysis of biological datasets from high-throughput sequencing technologies. Important instances include the modeling of microbiome compositions from amplicon sequencing surveys and the analysis of cell type compositions derived from single-cell RNA sequencing. Microbial and cell type abundance data share remarkably similar statistical features, including their inherent compositionality and a natural hierarchical ordering of the individual components from taxonomic or cell lineage tree information, respectively. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian model for tree-aggregated amplicon and single-cell compositional data analysis (tascCODA) that seamlessly integrates hierarchical information and experimental covariate data into the generative modeling of compositional count data. By combining latent parameters based on the tree structure with spike-and-slab Lasso penalization, tascCODA can determine covariate effects across different levels of the population hierarchy in a data-driven parsimonious way. In the context of differential abundance testing, we validate tascCODA's excellent performance on a comprehensive set of synthetic benchmark scenarios. Our analyses on human single-cell RNA-seq data from ulcerative colitis patients and amplicon data from patients with irritable bowel syndrome, respectively, identified aggregated cell type and taxon compositional changes that were more predictive and parsimonious than those proposed by other schemes. We posit that tascCODA constitutes a valuable addition to the growing statistical toolbox for generative modeling and analysis of compositional changes in microbial or cell population data.
