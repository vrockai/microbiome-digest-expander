Cancer-microbe associations have been explored for centuries, but cancer-associated fungi have rarely been examined. Here, we comprehensively characterize the cancer mycobiome within 17,401 patient tissue, blood, and plasma samples across 35 cancer types in four independent cohorts. We report fungal DNA and cells at low abundances across many major human cancers, with differences in community compositions that differ among cancer types, even when accounting for technical background. Fungal histological staining of tissue microarrays supported intratumoral presence and frequent spatial association with cancer cells and macrophages. Comparing intratumoral fungal communities with matched bacteriomes and immunomes revealed co-occurring bi-domain ecologies, often with permissive, rather than competitive, microenvironments and distinct immune responses. Clinically focused assessments suggested prognostic and diagnostic capacities of the tissue and plasma mycobiomes, even in stage I cancers, and synergistic predictive performance with bacteriomes.

## A pan-cancer mycobiome analysis reveals fungal involvement in gastrointestinal and lung tumors.
 30.09.2022, _AB Dohlman, J Klug, M Mesko, IH Gao, SM Lipkin, X Shen, ID Iliev_


Fungal microorganisms (mycobiota) comprise a small but immunoreactive component of the human microbiome, yet little is known about their role in human cancers. Pan-cancer analysis of multiple body sites revealed tumor-associated mycobiomes at up to 1 fungal cell per 104 tumor cells. In lung cancer, Blastomyces was associated with tumor tissues. In stomach cancers, high rates of Candida were linked to the expression of pro-inflammatory immune pathways, while in colon cancers Candida was predictive of metastatic disease and attenuated cellular adhesions. Across multiple GI sites, several Candida species were enriched in tumor samples and tumor-associated Candida DNA was predictive of decreased survival. The presence of Candida in human GI tumors was confirmed by external ITS sequencing of tumor samples and by culture-dependent analysis in an independent cohort. These data implicate the mycobiota in the pathogenesis of GI cancers and suggest that tumor-associated fungal DNA may serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.

## Nutrition, Immunosenescence, and Infectious Disease: An Overview of the Scientific Evidence on Micronutrients and on Modulation of the Gut Microbiota.
 02.10.2022, _PC Calder, EF Ortega, SN Meydani, Y Adkins, CB Stephensen, B Thompson, H Zwickey_


The immune system is key to host defense against pathogenic organisms. Aging is associated with changes in the immune system, with a decline in protective components (immunosenescence), increasing susceptibility to infectious disease, and a chronic elevation in low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), increasing the risk of multiple noncommunicable diseases. Nutrition is a determinant of immune cell function and of the gut microbiota. In turn, the gut microbiota shapes and controls the immune and inflammatory responses. Many older people show changes in the gut microbiota. Age-related changes in immune competence, low-grade inflammation, and gut dysbiosis may be interlinked and may relate, at least in part, to age-related changes in nutrition. A number of micronutrients (vitamins C, D, and E and zinc and selenium) play roles in supporting the function of many immune cell types. Some trials report that providing these micronutrients as individual supplements can reverse immune deficits in older people and/or in those with insufficient intakes. There is inconsistent evidence that this will reduce the risk or severity of infections including respiratory infections. Probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic strategies that modulate the gut microbiota, especially by promoting the colonization of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, have been demonstrated to modulate some immune and inflammatory biomarkers in older people and, in some cases, to reduce the risk and severity of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, although, again, the evidence is inconsistent. Further research with well-designed and well-powered trials in at-risk older populations is required to be more certain about the role of micronutrients and of strategies that modify the gut microbiota-host relationship in protecting against infection, especially respiratory infection.

## Machine-learning algorithms for asthma, COPD, and lung cancer risk assessment using circulating microbial extracellular vesicle data and their application to assess dietary effects.
 30.09.2022, _A McDowell, J Kang, J Yang, J Jung, YM Oh, SM Kym, TS Shin, TB Kim, YK Jee, YK Kim_


Although mounting evidence suggests that the microbiome has a tremendous influence on intractable disease, the relationship between circulating microbial extracellular vesicles (EVs) and respiratory disease remains unexplored. Here, we developed predictive diagnostic models for COPD, asthma, and lung cancer by applying machine learning to microbial EV metagenomes isolated from patient serum and coded by their accumulated taxonomic hierarchy. All models demonstrated high predictive strength with mean AUC values ranging from 0.93 to 0.99 with various important features at the genus and phylum levels. Application of the clinical models in mice showed that various foods reduced high-fat diet-associated asthma and lung cancer risk, while COPD was minimally affected. In conclusion, this study offers a novel methodology for respiratory disease prediction and highlights the utility of serum microbial EVs as data-rich features for noninvasive diagnosis.

## Microbiome ethics, guiding principles for microbiome research, use and knowledge management.

The overarching biological impact of microbiomes on their hosts, and more generally their environment, reflects the co-evolution of a mutualistic symbiosis, generating fitness for both. Knowledge of microbiomes, their systemic role, interactions, and impact grows exponentially. When a research field of importance for planetary health evolves so rapidly, it is essential to consider it from an ethical holistic perspective. However, to date, the topic of microbiome ethics has received relatively little attention considering its importance. Here, ethical analysis of microbiome research, innovation, use, and potential impact is structured around the four cornerstone principles of ethics: Do Good; Don't Harm; Respect; Act Justly. This simple, but not simplistic approach allows ethical issues to be communicative and operational. The essence of the paper is captured in a set of eleven microbiome ethics recommendations, e.g., proposing gut microbiome status as common global heritage, similar to the internationally agreed status of major food crops.

## The gut mycobiome in health, disease, and clinical applications in association with the gut bacterial microbiome assembly.
 01.10.2022, _F Zhang, D Aschenbrenner, JY Yoo, T Zuo_


The gut mycobiome (fungi) is a small but crucial component of the gut microbiome in humans. Intestinal fungi regulate host homoeostasis, pathophysiological and physiological processes, and the assembly of the co-residing gut bacterial microbiome. Over the past decade, accumulating studies have characterised the gut mycobiome in health and several pathological conditions. We review the compositional and functional diversity of the gut mycobiome in healthy populations from birth to adulthood. We describe factors influencing the gut mycobiome and the roles of intestinal fungi-especially Candida and Saccharomyces spp-in diseases and therapies with a particular focus on their synergism with the gut bacterial microbiome and host immunity. Finally, we discuss the underappreciated effects of gut fungi in clinical implications, and highlight future microbiome-based therapies that harness the tripartite relationship among the gut mycobiome, bacterial microbiome, and host immunity, aiming to restore a core gut mycobiome and microbiome and to improve clinical efficacy.

## Dietary Isoflavones Alter Gut Microbiota and Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis to Reduce Inflammation.
 30.09.2022, _S Ghimire, NM Cady, P Lehman, SR Peterson, SK Shahi, F Rashid, S Giri, AK Mangalam_


The etiopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is strongly affected by environmental factors such as diet and the gut microbiota. An isoflavone-rich (ISO) diet was previously shown to reduce the severity of MS in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Translation of this concept to clinical trial where dietary isoflavones may be recommended for MS patients will require preliminary evidence that providing the isoflavone-rich diet to people with MS (PwMS) who lack phytoestrogen-metabolizing bacteria has beneficial effects. We have previously shown that the gut microbiota of PwMS resembles the gut microbiota of mice raised under a phytoestrogen-free (phyto-free) diet in that it lacks phytoestrogen-metabolizing bacteria. To investigate the effects of phytoestrogens on the microbiota inflammatory response and EAE disease severity we switched the diet of mice raised under a phyto-free (PF) diet to an isoflavone-rich diet. Microbiota analysis showed that the change in diet from one that is ISO to one that is PF reduces beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium species. In addition we observed functional differences in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis pathways. Moreover LPS extracted from feces of mice fed an ISO diet induced increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines from bone marrow-derived macrophages relative to fecal-LPS isolated from mice fed a PF diet. Eventually mice whose diet was switched from a PF diet to an ISO diet trended toward reduced EAE severity and mortality. Overall we show that an isoflavone-rich diet specifically modulates LPS biosynthesis of the gut microbiota imparts an anti-inflammatory response and decreases disease severity.

## Study of cattle microbiota in different regions of Kazakhstan using 16S metabarcoding analysis.
 30.09.2022, _A Daugaliyeva, S Daugaliyeva, A Ashanin, S Kanatbayev, C Beltramo, S Peletto_


Methane (CH4) is an important greenhouse gas (GHG). Enteric methane emissions from farmed ruminant livestock account for approximately 15% of global GHG emissions, with approximately 44% of livestock emissions in the form of methane. The purpose of the research is to study the influence of feeding types and regional characteristics of Kazakhstan on the microbiota of feces and the number of methane-forming archaea of beef and meat-and-dairy cattle productivity. For this purpose, fecal samples were taken rectally from 37 cattle heads from four regions of Kazakhstan (Western, Southern, Northern and Southeast). The taxonomic composition of the community in all samples was determined by 16S metabarcoding; additionally alpha and beta diversities were calculated. The dominant phyla were: Firmicutes (57.30%), Bacteroidetes (17.00%), Verrucomicrobia (6.88%), Euryarchaeota (6.49%), Actinobacteria (4.77%) and Patescibacteria (3.38%). Significant differences with regard to methanogens bacteria were found: Euryarchaeota were less present in animals from Western Kazakhstan (2.40%), while Methanobacteriales and Methanobrevibacter were prevalent in Southeast, and less abundant in Western region. Western Kazakhstan differs from the other regions likely because animals are mainly grazed in the pasture. Thus, grazing animals has an impact on their microbiota thus leading to a decrease in methane emissions.

## Microscopic marine invertebrates are reservoirs for cryptic and diverse protists and fungi.

Microbial symbioses in marine invertebrates are commonplace. However, characterizations of invertebrate microbiomes are vastly outnumbered by those of vertebrates. Protists and fungi run the gamut of symbiosis, yet eukaryotic microbiome sequencing is rarely undertaken, with much of the focus on bacteria. To explore the importance of microscopic marine invertebrates as potential symbiont reservoirs, we used a phylogenetic-focused approach to analyze the host-associated eukaryotic microbiomes of 220 animal specimens spanning nine different animal phyla.

## Integrating Phylogenetic and Functional Data in Microbiome Studies.
 30.09.2022, _GM Douglas, MG Hayes, MGI Langille, E Borenstein_


Microbiome functional data are frequently analyzed to identify associations between microbial functions (e.g., genes) and sample groups of interest. However, it is challenging to distinguish between different possible explanations for variation in community-wide functional profiles by considering functions alone. To help address this problem, we have developed POMS, a package that implements multiple phylogeny-aware frameworks to more robustly identify enriched functions.

## Higher off-target amplicon detection rate in MiSeq v3 compared to v2 reagent kits in the context of 16S-rRNA-sequencing.
 01.10.2022, _ML Odendaal, JA Groot, R Hasrat, MLJN Chu, E Franz, D Bogaert, T Bosch, WAA de Steenhuijsen Piters_


One of the most widely used techniques in microbiota research is 16S-rRNA-sequencing. Several laboratory processes have been shown to impact sequencing results, especially in low biomass samples. Low biomass samples are prone to off-target amplification, where instead of bacterial DNA, host DNA is erroneously amplified. Knowledge on the laboratory processes influencing off-target amplification and detection is however scarce. We here expand on previous findings by demonstrating that off-target amplification is not limited to invasive biopsy samples, but is also an issue in low bacterial biomass respiratory (mucosal) samples, especially when below 0.3 pg/μL. We show that off-target amplification can partly be mitigated by using gel-based library purification methods. Importantly, we report a higher off-target amplicon detection rate when using MiSeq reagent kit v3 compared to v2 (mean 13.3% vs 0.1% off-target reads/sample, respectively), possibly as a result of differences in reagents or sequencing recipes. However, since after bioinformatic removal of off-target reads, MiSeq reagent kit v3 still results in a twofold higher number of reads when compared to v2, v3 is still preferred over v2. Together, these results add to the growing knowledge base on off-target amplification and detection, allowing researchers to anticipate this problem in 16S-rRNA-based microbiome studies involving low biomass samples.
