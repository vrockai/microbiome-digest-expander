## Predictive functional analysis reveals inferred features unique to cervicovaginal microbiota of African women with bacterial vaginosis and high-risk human papillomavirus infection.
 30.06.2021, _H Onywera, J Anejo-Okopi, LM Mwapagha, J Okendo, AL Williamson_


Mounting evidence suggests that Lactobacillus species may not necessarily be the sine qua non of healthy cervicovaginal microbiota (CVM), especially among reproductive-age African women. A majority of African women have high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM whose bacterial functions remain poorly characterized. Functional profiling of the CVM is vital for investigating human host-microbiota interactions in health and disease. Here, we investigated the functional potential of L. iners-dominated and high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM of 75 African women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV) and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. Functional contents were predicted using PICRUSt. Microbial taxonomic diversity, BV, and HR-HPV infection statuses were correlated with the inferred functional composition of the CVM. Differentially abundant inferred functional categories were identified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) (p-value &lt;0.05 and logarithmic LDA score &gt;2.0). Of the 75 women, 56 (74.7%), 35 (46.7%), and 29 (38.7%) had high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM, BV, and HR-HPV infection, respectively. Alpha diversity of the inferred functional contents (as measured by Shannon diversity index) was significantly higher in women with high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM and BV than their respective counterparts (H statistic ≥11.5, q-value &lt;0.001). Ordination of the predicted functional metagenome content (using Bray-Curtis distances) showed that the samples segregated according to the extent of microbial taxonomic diversity and BV (pseudo-F statistic ≥19.6, q-value = 0.001) but not HR-HPV status (pseudo-F statistic = 1.7, q-value = 0.159). LEfSe analysis of the inferred functional categories revealed that transport systems (including ABC transporters) and transcription factors were enriched in high-diversity CVM. Interestingly, transcription factors and sporulation functional categories were uniquely associated with high-diversity CVM, BV, and HR-HPV infection. Our predictive functional analysis reveals features unique to high-diversity CVM, BV and HR-HPV infections. Such features may represent important biomarkers of BV and HR-HPV infection. Our findings require proof-of-concept functional studies to examine the relevance of these potential biomarkers in women's reproductive health and disease.

## Effect of metronidazole on vaginal microbiota associated with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis.
 22.06.2021, _D Ruiz-Perez, MS Coudray, B Colbert, K Krupp, H Kumari, V Stebliankin, K Mathee, RL Cook, J Schwebke, G Narasimhan, P Madhivanan_


Vaginal dysbiosis-induced by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria is referred to as bacterial vaginosis (BV). The dysbiosis is associated with an increased risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted infections. Women with symptomatic BV are treated with oral metronidazole (MET), but its effectiveness remains to be elucidated. This study used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to determine the changes in the microbiota among women treated with MET. WGS was conducted on DNA obtained from 20 vaginal swabs collected at four time points over 12 months from five randomly selected African American (AA) women. The baseline visit included all women who were diagnosed with asymptomatic BV and were untreated. All subjects were tested subsequently once every 2 months and received a course of MET for each BV episode during the 12 months. The BV status was classified according to Nugent scores (NSs) of vaginal smears. The microbial and resistome profiles were analysed along with the sociodemographic metadata. Despite treatment, none of the five participants reverted to normal vaginal flora - two were consistently positive for BV, and the rest experienced episodic cases of BV. WGS analyses showed Gardnerella spp. as the most abundant organism. After treatment with MET, there was an observed decline of Lactobacillus and Prevotella species. One participant had a healthy vaginal microbiota based on NS at one follow-up time point. Resistance genes including tetM and lscA were detected. Though limited in subjects, this study shows specific microbiota changes with treatment, presence of many resistant genes in their microbiota, and recurrence and persistence of BV despite MET treatment. Thus, MET may not be an effective treatment option for asymptomatic BV, and whole metagenome sequence would better inform the choice of antibiotics.
