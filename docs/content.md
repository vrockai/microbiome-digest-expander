The correlation between the physical performance of athletes and their gut microbiota has become of growing interest in the past years, since new evidences have emerged regarding the importance of the gut microbiota as a main driver of the health status of athletes. In addition, it has been postulated that the metabolic activity of the microbial population harbored by the large intestine of athletes might influence their physical performances. Here, we analyzed 418 publicly available shotgun metagenomics datasets obtained from fecal samples of healthy athletes and healthy sedentary adults.

## Gut microbiome-based strategies for host health and disease.
 21.02.2023, _C Wang, J Bai, X Chen, J Song, Y Zhang, H Wang, H Suo_


Host health and disease are influenced by changes in the abundance and structure of intestinal flora. Current strategies are focused on regulating the structure of intestinal flora to ensure host health by alleviating disease. However, these strategies are limited by multiple factors, such as host genotype, physiology (microbiome, immunity, and gender), intervention, and diet. Accordingly, we reviewed the prospects and limitations of all strategies regulating the structure and abundance of microflora, including probiotics, prebiotics, diet, fecal microbiota transplantation, antibiotics, and phages. Some new technologies that can improve these strategies are also introduced. Compared with other strategies, diets and prebiotics are associated with reduced risk and high security. Besides, phages have the potential for application in the targeted regulation of intestinal microbiota due to their high specificity. Notably, the variability in individual microflora and their metabolic response to different interventions should be considered. Future studies should use artificial intelligence combined with multi-omics to investigate the host genome and physiology based on factors, such as blood type, dietary habits, and exercise, in order to develop individualized intervention strategies to improve host health.

The gut comprises the largest body interface with the environment and is continuously exposed to nutrients, food antigens, and commensal microbes, as well as to harmful pathogens. Subsets of both macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are present throughout the intestinal tract, where they primarily inhabit the gut-associate lymphoid tissue (GALT), such as Peyer's patches and isolated lymphoid follicles. In addition to their role in taking up and presenting antigens, macrophages and DCs possess extensive functional plasticity and these cells play complementary roles in maintaining immune homeostasis in the gut by preventing aberrant immune responses to harmless antigens and microbes and by promoting host defense against pathogens. The ability of macrophages and DCs to induce either inflammation or tolerance is partially lineage imprinted, but can also be dictated by their activation state, which in turn is determined by their specific microenvironment. These cells express several surface and intracellular receptors that detect danger signals, nutrients, and hormones, which can affect their activation state. DCs and macrophages play a fundamental role in regulating T cells and their effector functions. Thus, modulation of intestinal mucosa immunity by targeting antigen presenting cells can provide a promising approach for controlling pathological inflammation. In this review, we provide an overview on the characteristics, functions, and origins of intestinal macrophages and DCs, highlighting the intestinal microenvironmental factors that influence their functions during homeostasis. Unraveling the mechanisms by which macrophages and DCs regulate intestinal immunity will deepen our understanding on how the immune system integrates endogenous and exogenous signals in order to maintain the host's homeostasis.

## Awaking the Dormant Virome in the Rhizosphere.
 22.02.2023, _LPP Braga, RI Schumacher_


The rhizosphere is a vital soil compartment providing key plant-beneficial functions. However, little is known about the mechanisms driving viral diversity in the rhizosphere. Viruses can establish lytic or lysogenic interactions with their bacterial hosts. In the latter, they assume a dormant state integrated in the host genome and can be awakened by different perturbations that impact host cell physiology, triggering a viral bloom, which is potentially a fundamental mechanism driving soil viral diversity, as 22-68% of soil bacteria are predicted to harbor dormant viruses. Here we assessed the viral bloom response in rhizospheric viromes by exposing them to three contrasting soil perturbation agents: earthworms, herbicide and antibiotic pollutant. The viromes were next screened for rhizosphere-relevant genes and also used as inoculant on microcosms incubations to test their impacts on pristine microbiomes. Our results show that while post-perturbation viromes diverged from control conditions, viral communities exposed to both herbicide and antibiotic pollutant were more similar to each other than those influenced by earthworms. The latter also favored an increase in viral populations harboring genes involved in plant-beneficial functions. Post-perturbation viromes inoculated in soil microcosms changed the diversity of pristine microbiomes, suggesting that viromes are important components of the soil ecological memory driving eco-evolutionary processes that determines future microbiome trajectories according to past events. Our findings demonstrate that viromes are active players in the rhizosphere and need to be considered in efforts to understand and control the microbial processes towards sustainable crop production.

## Status of Infectious Diseases in Free-Ranging European Brown Hares (Lepus europaeus) Found Dead between 2017 and 2020 in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.
 25.02.2023, _M Faehndrich, JC Klink, M Roller, P Wohlsein, K Raue, C Strube, E Prenger-Berninghoff, C Ewers, L Capucci, A Lavazza, H Tomaso, JG Schnitzler, U Siebert_


The European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) is a quite adaptable species, but populations have been decreasing for several decades in different countries, including Germany. To investigate infectious diseases as possible influences on observed population decline in the German federal state Schleswig-Holstein, 118 deceased free-ranging European brown hares were collected between 2017 and 2020 and underwent detailed postmortem examination with extended sampling. Infectious diseases were a major cause of death (34.7%). The number of juveniles found exceeded the adult ones. The main pathomorphological findings were hepatitis (32.8%), pneumonia (22.2%), nephritis (19.1%), liver necrosis (12.9%), and enteritis (40.7%). An unusual main finding was steatitis (20.9%) of unknown origin. Animals were mainly emaciated and showed high infection rates with Eimeria spp. (91.3%) and Trichostrongylus spp. (36.2%). European Brown Hare Syndrome Virus reached an epidemic status with few fatal infections (4.2%) and high seroprevalence (64.9%), whereas the prevalence of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus 2 was very low (0.8%) in hares in Schleswig-Holstein. Pathogens such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (5.9%), Pasteurella multocida (0.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (3.4%) only caused sporadic deaths. This study illustrates the wide distribution of various infectious pathogens with high mortality and even zoonotic potential. Infectious diseases need to be considered as an important influence on population dynamics in Schleswig-Holstein.

Shellfish, such as the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), are an important agricultural commodity. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of the native microbiome of oysters against exogenous challenges by non-native pathogens. However, the taxonomic makeup of the oyster microbiome and the impact of environmental factors on it are understudied. Research was conducted quarterly over a calendar year (February 2020 through February 2021) to analyze the taxonomic diversity of bacteria present within the microbiome of consumer-ready-to-eat live Eastern oysters. It was hypothesized that a core group of bacterial species would be present in the microbiome regardless of external factors such as the water temperature at the time of harvest or post-harvesting processing. At each time point, 18 Chesapeake Bay (eastern United States) watershed aquacultured oysters were acquired from a local grocery store, genomic DNA was extracted from the homogenized whole oyster tissues, and the bacterial 16S rRNA gene hypervariable V4 region was PCR-amplified using barcoded primers prior to sequencing via Illumina MiSeq and bioinformatic analysis of the data. A core group of bacteria were identified to be consistently associated with the Eastern oyster, including members of the phyla Firmicutes and Spirochaetota, represented by the families Mycoplasmataceae and Spirochaetaceae, respectively. The phyla Cyanobacterota and Campliobacterota became more predominant in relation to warmer or colder water column temperature, respectively, at the time of oyster harvest.

## Staying below the Radar: Unraveling a New Family of Ubiquitous "Cryptic" Non-Tailed Temperate Vibriophages and Implications for Their Bacterial Hosts.
 26.02.2023, _PG Kalatzis, JJ Mauritzen, CS Winther-Have, S Michniewski, A Millard, MI Tsertou, P Katharios, M Middelboe_


Bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities in the oceans and play key roles in bacterial activity, diversity and evolution. While extensive research has been conducted on the role of tailed viruses (Class: Caudoviricetes), very little is known about the distribution and functions of the non-tailed viruses (Class: Tectiliviricetes). The recent discovery of the lytic Autolykiviridae family demonstrated the potential importance of this structural lineage, emphasizing the need for further exploration of the role of this group of marine viruses. Here, we report the novel family of temperate phages under the class of Tectiliviricetes, which we propose to name "Asemoviridae" with phage NO16 as a main representative. These phages are widely distributed across geographical regions and isolation sources and found inside the genomes of at least 30 species of Vibrio, in addition to the original V. anguillarum isolation host. Genomic analysis identified dif-like sites, suggesting that NO16 prophages recombine with the bacterial genome based on the XerCD site-specific recombination mechanism. The interactions between the NO16 phage and its V. anguillarum host were linked to cell density and phage-host ratio. High cell density and low phage predation levels were shown to favor the temperate over the lytic lifestyle for NO16 viruses, and their spontaneous induction rate was highly variable between different V. anguillarum lysogenic strains. NO16 prophages coexist with the V. anguillarum host in a mutualistic interaction by rendering fitness properties to the host, such as increased virulence and biofilm formation through lysogenic conversion, likely contributing to their global distribution.
