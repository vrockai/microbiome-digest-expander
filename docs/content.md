Physical particles can serve as critical abiotic factors that structure the ecology of microbial communities. For non-human vertebrate gut microbiomes, fecal particle size (FPS) has been known to be shaped by chewing efficiency and diet. However, little is known about what drives FPS in the human gut. Here, we analyzed FPS by laser diffraction across a total of 76 individuals and found FPS to be strongly individualized. Surprisingly, a behavioral intervention with 41 volunteers designed to increase chewing efficiency did not impact FPS. Dietary patterns could also not be associated with FPS. Instead, we found evidence that mammalian and human gut microbiomes shaped FPS. Fecal samples from germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice exhibited increased FPS relative to colonized mice. In humans, markers of longer transit time were correlated with smaller FPS. Gut microbiota diversity and composition were also associated with FPS. Finally, ex vivo culture experiments using human fecal microbiota from distinct donors showed that differences in microbiota community composition can drive variation in particle size. Together, our results support an ecological model in which the human gut microbiome plays a key role in reducing the size of food particles during digestion, and that the microbiomes of individuals vary in this capacity. These new insights also suggest FPS in humans to be governed by processes beyond those found in other mammals and emphasize the importance of gut microbiota in shaping their own abiotic environment.

## The Body, the Brain, the Environment, and Parkinson's Disease.

_Humans, Parkinson Disease, Environmental Exposure, Brain, Lewy Body Disease, alpha-Synuclein_
The brain- and body-first models of Lewy body disorders predict that aggregated alpha-synuclein pathology usually begins in either the olfactory system or the enteric nervous system. In both scenarios the pathology seems to arise in structures that are closely connected to the outside world. Environmental toxicants, including certain pesticides, industrial chemicals, and air pollution are therefore plausible trigger mechanisms for Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Here, we propose that toxicants inhaled through the nose can lead to pathological changes in alpha-synuclein in the olfactory system that subsequently spread and give rise to a brain-first subtype of Lewy body disease. Similarly, ingested toxicants can pass through the gut and cause alpha-synuclein pathology that then extends via parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways to ultimately produce a body-first subtype. The resulting spread can be tracked by the development of symptoms, clinical assessments, in vivo imaging, and ultimately pathological examination. The integration of environmental exposures into the brain-first and body-first models generates testable hypotheses, including on the prevalence of the clinical conditions, their future incidence, imaging patterns, and pathological signatures. The proposed link, though, has limitations and leaves many questions unanswered, such as the role of the skin, the influence of the microbiome, and the effects of ongoing exposures. Despite these limitations, the interaction of exogenous factors with the nose and the gut may explain many of the mysteries of Parkinson's disease and open the door toward the ultimate goal -prevention.

The negative diversity-invasion relationship observed in microbial invasion studies is commonly explained by competition between the invader and resident populations. However, whether this relationship is affected by invader-resident cooperative interactions is unknown. Using ecological and mathematical approaches, we examined the survival and functionality of Aminobacter niigataensis MSH1 to mineralize 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM), a groundwater micropollutant affecting drinking water production, in sand microcosms when inoculated together with synthetic assemblies of resident bacteria. The assemblies varied in richness and in strains that interacted pairwise with MSH1, including cooperative and competitive interactions. While overall, the negative diversity-invasion relationship was retained, residents engaging in cooperative interactions with the invader had a positive impact on MSH1 survival and functionality, highlighting the dependency of invasion success on community composition. No correlation existed between community richness and the delay in BAM mineralization by MSH1. The findings suggest that the presence of cooperative residents can alleviate the negative diversity-invasion relationship.

## High speciation rate of niche specialists in hot springs.

Ecological and evolutionary processes simultaneously regulate microbial diversity, but the evolutionary processes and their driving forces remain largely unexplored. Here we investigated the ecological and evolutionary characteristics of microbiota in hot springs spanning a broad temperature range (54.8-80 Â°C) by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes. Our results demonstrated that niche specialists and niche generalists are embedded in a complex interaction of ecological and evolutionary dynamics. On the thermal tolerance niche axis, thermal (T) sensitive (at a specific temperature) versus T-resistant (at least in five temperatures) species were characterized by different niche breadth, community abundance and dispersal potential, consequently differing in potential evolutionary trajectory. The niche-specialized T-sensitive species experienced strong temperature barriers, leading to completely species shift and high fitness but low abundant communities at each temperature ("home niche"), and such trade-offs thus reinforced peak performance, as evidenced by high speciation across temperatures and increasing diversification potential with temperature. In contrast, T-resistant species are advantageous of niche expansion but with poor local performance, as shown by wide niche breadth with high extinction, indicating these niche generalists are "jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none". Despite of such differences, the T-sensitive and T-resistant species are evolutionarily interacted. Specifically, the continuous transition from T-sensitive to T-resistant species insured the exclusion probability of T-resistant species at a relatively constant level across temperatures. The co-evolution and co-adaptation of T-sensitive and T-resistant species were in line with the red queen theory. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that high speciation of niche specialists could alleviate the environmental-filtering-induced negative effect on diversity.

## Meta-analysis of the Cetacea gut microbiome: Diversity, co-evolution, and interaction with the anthropogenic pathobiome.
 07.05.2024, _E Radaelli, G Palladino, E Nanetti, D Scicchitano, S Rampelli, S Airoldi, M Candela, M Marangi_


Despite their critical roles in marine ecosystems, only few studies have addressed the gut microbiome (GM) of cetaceans in a comprehensive way. Being long-living apex predators with a carnivorous diet but evolved from herbivorous ancestors, cetaceans are an ideal model for studying GM-host evolutionary drivers of symbiosis and represent a valuable proxy of overall marine ecosystem health. Here, we investigated the GM of eight different cetacean species, including both Odontocetes (toothed whales) and Mysticetes (baleen whales), by means of 16S rRNA-targeted amplicon sequencing. We collected faecal samples from free-ranging cetaceans circulating within the Pelagos Sanctuary (North-western Mediterranean Sea) and we also included publicly available cetacean gut microbiome sequences. Overall, we show a clear GM trajectory related to host phylogeny and taxonomy (i.e., phylosymbiosis), with remarkable GM variations which may reflect adaptations to different diets between baleen and toothed whales. While most samples were found to be infected by protozoan parasites of potential anthropic origin, we report that this phenomenon did not lead to severe GM dysbiosis. This study underlines the importance of both host phylogeny and diet in shaping the GM of cetaceans, highlighting the role of neutral processes as well as environmental factors in the establishment of this GM-host symbiosis. Furthermore, the presence of potentially human-derived protozoan parasites in faeces of free-ranging cetaceans emphasizes the importance of these animals as bioindicators of anthropic impact on marine ecosystems.

## Comparative analysis of gut microbiome of mangrove brachyuran crabs revealed patterns of phylosymbiosis and codiversification.
 07.05.2024, _CTT Tsang, TKL Hui, NM Chung, WT Yuen, LM Tsang_


The acquisition of microbial symbionts enables animals to rapidly adapt to and exploit novel ecological niches, thus significantly enhancing the evolutionary fitness and success of their hosts. However, the dynamics of host-microbe interactions and their evolutionary implications remain largely underexplored in marine invertebrates. Crabs of the family Sesarmidae (Crustacea: Brachyura) are dominant inhabitants of mangrove forests and are considered keystone species there. Their rapid diversification, particularly after adopting a plant-feeding lifestyle, is believed to have been facilitated by symbiotic gut microbes, enabling successful colonization of intertidal and terrestrial environments. To investigate the patterns and mechanisms shaping the microbial communities and the role of microbes in the evolution of Sesarmidae, we characterized and compared the gut microbiome compositions across 43 crab species from Sesarmidae and other mangrove-associated families using 16S metabarcoding. We found that the gut microbiome assemblages in crabs are primarily determined by host identity, with a secondary influence from environmental factors such as microhabitat and sampling location, and to a lesser extent influenced by biological factors such as sex and gut region. While patterns of phylosymbiosis (i.e. when microbial community relationships recapitulate the phylogeny of their hosts) were consistently observed in all beta-diversity metrics analysed, the strength of phylosymbiosis varied across crab families. This suggests that the bacterial assemblages in each family were differentially shaped by different degrees of host filtering and/or other evolutionary processes. Notably, Sesarmidae displayed signals of cophylogeny with its core gut bacterial genera, which likely play crucial functional roles in their hosts by providing lignocellulolytic enzymes, essential amino acids, and fatty acids supplementation. Our results support the hypothesis of microbial contribution to herbivory and terrestrialization in mangrove crabs, highlighting the tight association and codiversification of the crab holobiont.

## A perfusion host-microbe bioreactor (HMB) system that captures dynamic interactions of secreted metabolites between epithelial cells cocultured with a human gut anaerobe.

The human microbiota impacts a variety of diseases and responses to therapeutics. Due to a lack of robust in vitro models, detailed mechanistic explanations of host-microbiota interactions cannot often be recapitulated. We describe the design and development of a novel, versatile and modular in vitro system that enables indirect coculture of human epithelial cells with anaerobic bacteria for the characterization of host-microbe secreted metabolite interactions. This system was designed to compartmentalize anaerobes and human cells in separate chambers conducive to each organism's requisite cell growth conditions. Using perfusion, fluidic mixing, and automated sample collection, the cells continuously received fresh media, while in contact with their corresponding compartments conditioned supernatant. Supernatants from each chamber were collected in a cell-free time-resolved fashion. The system sustained low oxygen conditions in the anaerobic chamber, while also supporting the growth of a representative anaerobe (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) and a human colonic epithelial cell line (Caco-2) in the aerobic chamber. Caco-2 global gene expression changes in response to coculture with B. thetaiotaomicron was characterized using RNA sequencing. Extensive, targeted metabolomics analysis of over 150 central carbon metabolites was performed on the serially collected supernatants. We observed broad metabolite changes in host-microbe coculture, compared to respective mono-culture controls. These effects were dependent both on sampling time and the compartment probed (apical vs. basolateral). Coculturing resulted in the depletion of several important metabolites, including guanine, uridine 5'-monophosphate, asparagine, and thiamine. Additionally, while Caco-2 cells cultured alone predominantly affected the basolateral metabolite milieu, increased abundance of 2,3-dihydroxyisovalerate and thymine on the basolateral side, occurred when the cells were cocultured with B. thetaiotaomicron. Thus, our system can capture the dynamic, competitive and cooperative processes between host cells and gut microbes.

After two decades of extensive microbiome research, the current forefront of scientific exploration involves moving beyond description and classification to uncovering the intricate mechanisms underlying the coalescence of microbial communities. Deciphering microbiome assembly has been technically challenging due to their vast microbial diversity but establishing a synthetic community (SynCom) serves as a key strategy in unravelling this process. Achieving absolute quantification is crucial for establishing causality in assembly dynamics. However, existing approaches are primarily designed to differentiate a specific group of microorganisms within a particular SynCom.

## Sterile sentinels and MinION sequencing capture active soil microbial communities that differentiate crop rotations.
 10.05.2024, _SR Erlandson, PM Ewing, SL Osborne, RM Lehman_


Soil microbial communities are difficult to measure and critical to soil processes. The bulk soil microbiome is highly diverse and spatially heterogeneous, which can make it difficult to detect and monitor the responses of microbial communities to differences or changes in management, such as different crop rotations in agricultural research. Sampling a subset of actively growing microbes should promote monitoring how soil microbial communities respond to management by reducing the variation contributed by high microbial spatial and temporal heterogeneity and less active microbes. We tested an in-growth bag method using sterilized soil in root-excluding mesh, "sterile sentinels," for the capacity to differentiate between crop rotations. We assessed the utility of different incubation times and compared colonized sentinels to concurrently sampled bulk soils for the statistical power to differentiate microbial community composition in low and high diversity crop rotations. We paired this method with Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing to assess sterile sentinels as a standardized, fast turn-around monitoring method.
