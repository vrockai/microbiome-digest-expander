Pulmonary tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease of the respiratory system. It is still one of the leading causes of death from a single infectious disease, but it has been stuck in the study of a single pathogen. Recent studies have shown that many diseases are associated with disruption of the native microbiota. In this study we investigated the occurrence of tuberculosis and the correlation between drug resistance and respiratory flora. High-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the respiratory microbiota composition of 30 tuberculosis (TB) affected patients and compared with 30 healthy (H) controls. According to their Gene Xpert results, 30 pulmonary tuberculosis patients were divided into 12 persons in the drug-sensitive group (DS0) and 18 persons in the drug-resistant group (DR0). The microbial flora of the two were compared with the H group.

## Oral Bacteriome and Mycobiome across Stages of Oral Carcinogenesis.

Oral microbial dysbiosis contributes to the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Numerous studies have focused on variations in the oral bacterial microbiota of patients with OSCC. However, similar studies on fungal microbiota, another integral component of the oral microbiota, are scarce. Moreover, there is an evidence gap regarding the role that microecosystems play in different niches of the oral cavity at different stages of oral carcinogenesis. Here, we catalogued the microbial communities in the human oral cavity by profiling saliva, gingival plaque, and mucosal samples at different stages of oral carcinogenesis. We analyzed the oral bacteriome and mycobiome along the health-premalignancy-carcinoma sequence. Some species, including Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Acremonium exuviarum, and Aspergillus fumigatus, were enriched, whereas others, such as Streptococcus salivarius subsp. salivarius, Scapharca broughtonii, Mortierella echinula, and Morchella septimelata, were depleted in OSCC. These findings suggest that an array of signature species, including bacteria and fungi, are closely associated with oral carcinogenesis. OSCC-associated diversity differences, species distinction, and functional alterations were most remarkable in mucosal samples, not in gingival plaque or saliva samples, suggesting an urgent need to define oral carcinogenesis-associated microbial dysbiosis based on the spatial microbiome. IMPORTANCE Abundant oral microorganisms constitute a complex microecosystem within the oral environment of the host, which plays a critical role in the adjustment of various physiological and pathological states of the oral cavity. In this study, we demonstrated that variations in the "core microbiome" may be used to predict carcinogenesis. In addition, sample data collected from multiple oral sites along the health-premalignancy-carcinoma sequence increase our understanding of the microecosystems of different oral niches and their specific changes during oral carcinogenesis. This work provides insight into the roles of bacteria and fungi in OSCC and may contribute to the development of early diagnostic assays and novel treatments.

## Targeted suppression of human IBD-associated gut microbiota commensals by phage consortia for treatment of intestinal inflammation.

Human gut commensals are increasingly suggested to impact non-communicable diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), yet their targeted suppression remains a daunting unmet challenge. In four geographically distinct IBD cohorts (n = 537), we identify a clade of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) strains, featuring a unique antibiotics resistance and mobilome signature, to be strongly associated with disease exacerbation and severity. Transfer of clinical IBD-associated Kp strains into colitis-prone, germ-free, and colonized mice enhances intestinal inflammation. Stepwise generation of a lytic five-phage combination, targeting sensitive and resistant IBD-associated Kp clade members through distinct mechanisms, enables effective Kp suppression in colitis-prone mice, driving an attenuated inflammation and disease severity. Proof-of-concept assessment of Kp-targeting phages in an artificial human gut and in healthy volunteers demonstrates gastric acid-dependent phage resilience, safety, and viability in the lower gut. Collectively, we demonstrate the feasibility of orally administered combination phage therapy in avoiding resistance, while effectively inhibiting non-communicable disease-contributing pathobionts.
