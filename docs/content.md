While rapid demographic changes in Asia are driving the incidence of chronic aging-related diseases, the limited availability of high-quality in vivo data hampers our ability to understand complex multi-factorial contributions, including gut microbial, to healthy aging. Leveraging a well-phenotyped cohort of community-living octogenarians in Singapore, we used deep shotgun-metagenomic sequencing for high-resolution taxonomic and functional characterization of their gut microbiomes (n = 234). Joint species-level analysis with other Asian cohorts identified distinct age-associated shifts characterized by reduction in microbial richness, and specific Alistipes and Bacteroides species enrichment (e.g., Alistipes shahii and Bacteroides xylanisolvens). Functional analysis confirmed these changes correspond to metabolic potential expansion in aging towards alternate pathways synthesizing and utilizing amino-acid precursors, vis-à-vis dominant microbial guilds producing butyrate in gut from pyruvate (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia inulinivorans). Extending these observations to key clinical markers helped identify &gt;10 robust microbial associations to inflammation, cardiometabolic and liver health, including potential probiotic species (e.g., Parabacteroides goldsteinii) and pathobionts (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae), highlighting the microbiome's role as biomarkers and potential targets for promoting healthy aging.

## The role of KLF5 in gut microbiota and lung adenocarcinoma: unveiling programmed cell death pathways and prognostic biomarkers.
 08.09.2024, _Q Fang, M Xu, W Yao, R Wu, R Han, S Kawakita, A Shen, S Guan, J Zhang, X Sun, M Zhou, N Li, Q Sun, CS Dong_


Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most important subtype of lung cancer. It is well known that the gut microbiome plays an important role in the pathophysiology of various diseases, including cancer, but little research has been done on the intestinal microbiome associated with LUAD. Utilizing bioinformatics tools and data analysis, we identified novel potential prognostic biomarkers for LUAD. To integrate differentially expressed genes and clinical significance modules, we used a weighted correlation network analysis system. According to the Peryton database and the gutMGene database, the composition and structure of gut microbiota in LUAD patients differed from those in healthy individuals. LUAD was associated with 150 gut microbiota and 767 gut microbiota targets, with Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) being the most closely related. KLF5 was associated with immune status and correlated well with the prognosis of LUAD patients. The identification of KLF5 as a potential prognostic biomarker suggests its utility in improving risk stratification and guiding personalized treatment strategies for LUAD patients. Altogether, KLF5 could be a potential prognostic biomarker in LUAD.

## Reversions mask the contribution of adaptive evolution in microbiomes.

When examining bacterial genomes for evidence of past selection, the results depend heavily on the mutational distance between chosen genomes. Even within a bacterial species, genomes separated by larger mutational distances exhibit stronger evidence of purifying selection as assessed by dN/dS, the normalized ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations. Here, we show that the classical interpretation of this scale dependence, weak purifying selection, leads to problematic mutation accumulation when applied to available gut microbiome data. We propose an alternative, adaptive reversion model with opposite implications for dynamical intuition and applications of dN/dS. Reversions that occur and sweep within-host populations are nearly guaranteed in microbiomes due to large population sizes, short generation times, and variable environments. Using analytical and simulation approaches, we show that adaptive reversion can explain the dN/dS decay given only dozens of locally fluctuating selective pressures, which is realistic in the context of Bacteroides genomes. The success of the adaptive reversion model argues for interpreting low values of dN/dS obtained from long timescales with caution as they may emerge even when adaptive sweeps are frequent. Our work thus inverts the interpretation of an old observation in bacterial evolution, illustrates the potential of mutational reversions to shape genomic landscapes over time, and highlights the importance of studying bacterial genomic evolution on short timescales.

## The hidden base of the iceberg: gut peptidoglycome dynamics is foundational to its influence on the host.
 06.09.2024, _R Wheeler, I Gomperts Boneca_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Peptidoglycan, Bacteria, Animals, Host Microbial Interactions, Homeostasis, Cell Wall_
The intestinal microbiota of humans includes a highly diverse range of bacterial species. All these bacteria possess a cell wall, composed primarily of the macromolecule peptidoglycan. As such, the gut also harbors an abundant and varied peptidoglycome. A remarkable range of host physiological pathways are regulated by peptidoglycan fragments that originate from the gut microbiota and enter the host system. Interactions between the host system and peptidoglycan can influence physiological development and homeostasis, promote health, or contribute to inflammatory disease. Underlying these effects is the interplay between microbiota composition and enzymatic processes that shape the intestinal peptidoglycome, dictating the types of peptidoglycan generated, that subsequently cross the gut barrier. In this review, we highlight and discuss the hidden and emerging functional aspects of the microbiome, i.e. the hidden base of the iceberg, that modulate the composition of gut peptidoglycan, and how these fundamental processes are drivers of physiological outcomes for the host.

_Extracellular Vesicles, Humans, Animals, Microbiota, Host Microbial Interactions_
Extracellular vesicles have emerged as key players in cellular communication, influencing various physiological processes and pathophysiological progression, including digestion, immune response, and tissue repairs. Recently, a class of EVs derived from microbial communities has gained significant attention due to their pivotal role in intercellular communication and their potential as biomarkers and biotherapeutic agents. Microbial EVs are membrane-bound molecules encapsulating bioactive metabolites that modulate host physiological and pathological processes. This chapter discusses the evolving history of microbiota-produced EVs, including their discovery, characterization, current research status, and their diverse mechanisms of interaction with other microbes and hosts. This review also highlights the importance of EVs in health and disease and discusses recent research that shows promising results for the therapeutic potential of EVs.

## Pathophysiological and Clinical Potential of Human Microbiome: Microbe-based Therapeutic Insights.
 06.09.2024, _S Sanyal, K Nigam, S Singh, P Lohani, M Dwivedi_


The human microbiota represents the community and diverse population of microbes within the human body, which comprises approximately 100 trillion micro-organisms. They exist in the human gastrointestinal tract and various other organs and are now considered virtual body organs. It is mainly represented by bacteria but also includes viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Although there is a heritable component to the gut microbiota, environmental factors related to diet, drugs, and anthropometry determine the composition of the microbiota. Besides the gastrointestinal tract, the human body also harbours microbial communities in the skin, oral and nasal cavities, and reproductive tract. The current review demonstrates the role of gut microbiota and its involvement in processing food, drugs, and immune responses. The discussion focuses on the implications of human microbiota in developing several diseases, such as gastrointestinal infections, metabolic disorders, malignancies, etc., through symbiotic relationships. The microbial population may vary depending on the pathophysiological condition of an individual and thus may be exploited as a therapeutic and clinical player. Further, we need a more thorough investigation to establish the correlation between microbes and pathophysiology in humans and propose them as potential therapeutic targets.

Securing a stable food supply and achieving sustainable agricultural production are essential for mitigating future food insecurity. Soil metabolomics is a promising tool for capturing soil status, which is a critical issue for future sustainable food security. This study aims to provide deeper insights into the status of soybean-grown fields under varying soil conditions over three years by employing comprehensive soil volatile organic compound (VOC) profiling, also known as soil volatilomics. Profiling identified approximately 200 peaks in agricultural fields. The soil of soybean-presented plots exhibited markedly higher VOC levels than those of non-soybean plots during the flowering season. Pentanoic acid, 2,2,4-trimethyl-3-carboxyisopropyl, isobutyl ester, a discriminative soil VOC, was identified through multivariate data analysis as a distinctively present VOC in fields with or without soybean plants during the flowering period. Soil VOC profiles exhibited strong correlations with soil-related omics datasets (soil ionome, microbiome, metabolome, and physics) and no significant correlations with root microbiome and rhizosphere chemicals. These findings indicate that soil VOC profiles could serve as a valuable indicator for assessing soil status, thereby supporting efforts to ensure future global food security.

## Meddling with the microbiota: Fungal tricks to infect plant hosts.
 06.09.2024, _F Mesny, M Bauer, J Zhu, BPHJ Thomma_


Plants associate with a wealth of microbes, collectively referred to as the plant microbiota, whose composition is determined by host plant genetics, immune responses, environmental factors and intermicrobial relations. Unsurprisingly, microbiota compositions change during disease development. Recent evidence revealed that some of these changes can be attributed to effector proteins with antimicrobial activities that are secreted by plant pathogens to manipulate host microbiota to their advantage. Intriguingly, many of these effectors have ancient origins, predating land plant emergence, and evolved over long evolutionary trajectories to acquire selective antimicrobial activities to target microbial antagonists in host plant microbiota. Thus, we argue that host-pathogen co-evolution likely involved arms races within the host-associated microbiota.

## A comprehensive catalog encompassing 1376 species-level genomes reveals the core community and functional diversity of anammox microbiota.
 05.09.2024, _D Wang, Y Meng, LN Huang, XX Zhang, X Luo, F Meng_


Research on the microbial community and function of the anammox process for environmentally friendly wastewater treatment has achieved certain success, which may mean more universal insights are needed. However, the comprehensive understanding of the anammox process is constrained by the limited taxonomic assignment and functional characterization of anammox microbiota, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality genomes for most organisms. This study reported a global genome catalog of anammox microbiotas based on numerous metagenomes obtained from both lab- and full-scale systems. A total of 1376 candidate species from 7474 metagenome-assembled genomes were used to construct the genome catalog, providing extensive microbial coverage (averaged of 92.40 %) of anammox microbiota. Moreover, a total of 64 core genera and 44 core species were identified, accounting for approximately 64.25 % and 43.97 %, respectively, of anammox microbiota. The strict core genera encompassed not only functional bacteria (e.g., Brocadia, Desulfobacillus, Zeimonas, and Nitrosomonas) but also two candidate genera (UBA12294 and OLB14) affiliated with the order Anaerolineales. In particular, core denitrifying bacteria with observably taxonomic diversity exhibited diverse functional profiles; for instance, the potential of carbohydrate metabolism in Desulfobacillus and Zeimonas likely improves the mixotrophic lifestyle of anammox microbiota. Besides, a noteworthy association was detected between anammox microbiota and system type. Microbiota in coupling system exhibited complex diversity and interspecies interactions by limiting numerous core denitrifying bacteria. In summary, the constructed catalog substantially expands our understanding of the core community and their functions of anammox microbiota, providing a valuable resource for future studies on anammox systems.

## Revealing the intricate temporal dynamics and adaptive responses of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes in the coastal South China Sea.
 06.09.2024, _W Xu, Y Xu, R Sun, E Rey Redondo, KK Leung, SH Wan, J Li, CCM Yung_


This comprehensive two-year investigation in the coastal South China Sea has advanced our understanding of marine microbes at both community and genomic levels. By combining metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, we have revealed the intricate temporal dynamics and remarkable adaptability of microbial communities and phytoplankton metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) in response to environmental fluctuations. We observed distinct seasonal shifts in microbial community composition and function: cyanobacteria were predominant during warmer months, whereas photosynthetic protists were more abundant during colder seasons. Notably, metabolic marker KOs of photosynthesis were consistently active throughout the year, underscoring the persistent role of these processes irrespective of seasonal changes. Our analysis reveals that environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, and nitrate concentrations profoundly influence microbial community composition, while temperature and silicate have emerged as crucial factors shaping their functional traits. Through the recovery and analysis of 37 phytoplankton MAGs, encompassing nine prokaryotic cyanobacteria and 28 eukaryotic protists from diverse phyla, we have gained insights into their genetic diversity and metabolic capabilities. Distinct profiles of photosynthesis-related pathways including carbon fixation, carotenoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, and photosynthesis among the MAGs indicated their genetic adaptations to changing environmental conditions. This study not only enhances our understanding of microbial dynamics in coastal marine ecosystems but also sheds light on the ecological roles and adaptive responses of different microbial groups to environmental changes.
