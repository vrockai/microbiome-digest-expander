_Humans, Peri-Implantitis, Microbiota_
We performed a longitudinal shotgun metagenomic investigation of the plaque microbiome associated with peri-implant diseases in a cohort of 91 subjects with 320 quality-controlled metagenomes. Through recently improved taxonomic profiling methods, we identified the most discriminative species between healthy and diseased subjects at baseline, evaluated their change over time, and provided evidence that clinical treatment had a positive effect on plaque microbiome composition in patients affected by mucositis and peri-implantitis.

## Treatment status of psychiatric disorders and falls in the workplace among Japanese workers: a nationwide cross-sectional study.
 22.02.2024, _A Yama, T Nagata, K Odagami, NP Adi, M Nagata, K Mori, FT W S-Ohpm Study_


In Japan, the most common injury requiring sick leave is a fall in the workplace; therefore, it is very important to prevent falls. Most measures to prevent falls involve aspects of the workplace environment and safety. However, few measures consider the perspective of individual health. We investigated the relationship between psychiatric disorders and falls in the workplace and whether treatment status for a psychiatric disorder is associated with workplace falls.

## Longitudinal quantification of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis reveals late colonization in the infant gut independent of maternal milk HMO composition.
 06.02.2024, _D Ennis, S Shmorak, E Jantscher-Krenn, M Yassour_


_Infant, Female, Humans, Health Maintenance Organizations, Longitudinal Studies, Milk, Human, Bifidobacterium, Oligosaccharides, Bifidobacterium longum_
Breast milk contains human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) that cannot be digested by infants, yet nourish their developing gut microbiome. While Bifidobacterium are the best-known utilizers of individual HMOs, a longitudinal study examining the evolving microbial community at high-resolution coupled with mothers' milk HMO composition is lacking. Here, we developed a high-throughput method to quantify Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (BL. infantis), a proficient HMO-utilizer, and applied it to a longitudinal cohort consisting of 21 mother-infant dyads. We observed substantial changes in the infant gut microbiome over the course of several months, while the HMO composition in mothers' milk remained relatively stable. Although Bifidobacterium species significantly influenced sample variation, no specific HMOs correlated with Bifidobacterium species abundance. Surprisingly, we found that BL. infantis colonization began late in the breastfeeding period both in our cohort and in other geographic locations, highlighting the importance of focusing on BL. infantis dynamics in the infant gut.

_Humans, Case-Control Studies, Sports, Exercise, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Athletic Performance_
The influence of human gut microbiota on health and disease is now commonly appreciated. Therefore, it is not surprising that microbiome research has found interest in the sports community, hoping to improve health and optimize performance. Comparative studies found new species or pathways that were more enriched in elites than sedentary controls. In addition, sport-specific and performance-level-specific microbiome features have been identified. However, the results remain inconclusive and indicate the need for further assessment. In this case-control study, we tested two athletic populations (i.e. strength athletes, endurance athletes) and a non-athletic, but physically active, control group across two acute exercise bouts, separated by a 2-week period, that measured explosive and high intensity fitness level (repeated 30-s all-out Wingate test (WT)) and cardiorespiratory fitness level (Bruce Treadmill Test). While we did not identify any group differences in alpha and beta diversity or significant differential abundance of microbiome components at baseline, one-third of the species identified were unique to each group. Longitudinal sample (pre- and post-exercise) analysis revealed an abundance of Alistipes communis in the strength group during the WT and 88 species with notable between-group differences during the Bruce Test. SparCC recognized Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis, short-chain fatty acid producers with probiotic properties, species strongly associated with VO2max. Ultimately, we identified several taxa with different baseline abundances and longitudinal changes when comparing individuals based on their VO2max, average power, and maximal power parameters. Our results confirmed that the health status of individuals are consistent with assumptions about microbiome health. Furthermore, our findings indicate that microbiome features are associated with better performance previously identified in elite athletes.

## The impact of iron supplementation on the preterm neonatal gut microbiome: A pilot study.
 23.02.2024, _M VanOrmer, M Thompson, M Thoene, JJ Riethoven, SK Natarajan, C Hanson, A Anderson-Berry_


_Infant, Infant, Newborn, Humans, Infant, Premature, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Pilot Projects, Dysbiosis, Iron, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Dietary Supplements, Feces_
The gastrointestinal microbiome in preterm infants exhibits significant influence on optimal outcomes-with dysbiosis shown to substantially increase the risk of the life-threatening necrotizing enterocolitis. Iron is a vital nutrient especially during the perinatal window of rapid hemoglobin production, tissue growth, and foundational neurodevelopment. However, excess colonic iron exhibits potent oxidation capacity and alters the gut microbiome-potentially facilitating the proliferation of pathological bacterial strains. Breastfed preterm infants routinely receive iron supplementation starting 14 days after delivery and are highly vulnerable to morbidities associated with gastrointestinal dysbiosis. Therefore, we set out to determine if routine iron supplementation alters the preterm gut microbiome.

## Insights into gut microbiomes in stem cell transplantation by comprehensive shotgun long-read sequencing.
 22.02.2024, _P Spohr, S Scharf, A Rommerskirchen, B Henrich, P Jäger, GW Klau, R Haas, A Dilthey, K Pfeffer_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Microbiota, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Bacteria, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Fungi, DNA, Ribosomal, Metagenomics_
The gut microbiome is a diverse ecosystem, dominated by bacteria; however, fungi, phages/viruses, archaea, and protozoa are also important members of the gut microbiota. Exploration of taxonomic compositions beyond bacteria as well as an understanding of the interaction between the bacteriome with the other members is limited using 16S rDNA sequencing. Here, we developed a pipeline enabling the simultaneous interrogation of the gut microbiome (bacteriome, mycobiome, archaeome, eukaryome, DNA virome) and of antibiotic resistance genes based on optimized long-read shotgun metagenomics protocols and custom bioinformatics. Using our pipeline we investigated the longitudinal composition of the gut microbiome in an exploratory clinical study in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT; n = 31). Pre-transplantation microbiomes exhibited a 3-cluster structure, characterized by Bacteroides spp. /Phocaeicola spp., mixed composition and Enterococcus abundances. We revealed substantial inter-individual and temporal variabilities of microbial domain compositions, human DNA, and antibiotic resistance genes during the course of alloHSCT. Interestingly, viruses and fungi accounted for substantial proportions of microbiome content in individual samples. In the course of HSCT, bacterial strains were stable or newly acquired. Our results demonstrate the disruptive potential of alloHSCTon the gut microbiome and pave the way for future comprehensive microbiome studies based on long-read metagenomics.

## Donor-recipient intermicrobial interactions impact transfer of subspecies and fecal microbiota transplantation outcome.

Studies on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have reported inconsistent connections between clinical outcomes and donor strain engraftment. Analyses of subspecies-level crosstalk and its influences on lineage transfer in metagenomic FMT datasets have proved challenging, as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are generally not linked and are often absent. Here, we utilized species genome bin (SGB), which employs co-abundance binning, to investigate subspecies-level microbiome dynamics in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who had gastrointestinal comorbidities and underwent encapsulated FMT (Chinese Clinical Trial: 2100043906). We found that interactions between donor and recipient microbes, which were overwhelmingly phylogenetically divergent, were important for subspecies transfer and positive clinical outcomes. Additionally, a donor-recipient SGB match was indicative of a high likelihood of strain transfer. Importantly, these ecodynamics were shared across FMT datasets encompassing multiple diseases. Collectively, these findings provide detailed insight into specific microbial interactions and dynamics that determine FMT success.

## The gut ileal mucosal virome is disturbed in patients with Crohn's disease and exacerbates intestinal inflammation in mice.
 22.02.2024, _Z Cao, D Fan, Y Sun, Z Huang, Y Li, R Su, F Zhang, Q Li, H Yang, F Zhang, Y Miao, P Lan, X Wu, T Zuo_


Gut bacteriome dysbiosis is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Crohn's disease (CD) is an IBD subtype with extensive mucosal inflammation, yet the mucosal virome, an empirical modulator of the bacteriome and mucosal immunity, remains largely unclear regarding its composition and role. Here, we exploited trans-cohort CD patients and healthy individuals to compositionally and functionally investigate the small bowel (terminal ileum) virome and bacteriome. The CD ileal virome was characterised by an under-representation of both lytic and temperate bacteriophages (especially those targeting bacterial pathogens), particularly in patients with flare-up. Meanwhile, the virome-bacteriome ecology in CD ileal mucosa was featured by a lack of Bifidobacterium- and Lachnospiraceae-led mutualistic interactions between bacteria and bacteriophages; surprisingly it was more pronounced in CD remission than flare-up, underlining the refractory and recurrent nature of mucosal inflammation in CD. Lastly, we substantiated that ileal virions from CD patients causally exacerbated intestinal inflammation in IBD mouse models, by reshaping a gut virome-bacteriome ecology preceding intestinal inflammation (microbial trigger) and augmenting microbial sensing/defence pathways in the intestine cells (host response). Altogether, our results highlight the significance of mucosal virome in CD pathogenesis and importance of mucosal virome restoration in CD therapeutics.

## TH17 cell: a double-edged sword in the development of inflammatory bowel disease.
 23.02.2024, _Y Wen, H Wang, D Tian, G Wang_


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic nonspecific inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, and its pathogenesis has not been fully understood. Extensive dysregulation of the intestinal mucosal immune system is critical in the development and progression of IBD. T helper (Th) 17 cells have the characteristics of plasticity. They can transdifferentiate into subpopulations with different functions in response to different factors in the surrounding environment, thus taking on different roles in regulating the intestinal immune responses. In this review, we will focus on the plasticity of Th17 cells as well as the function of Th17 cells and their related cytokines in IBD. We will summarize their pathogenic and protective roles in IBD under different conditions, respectively, hoping to further deepen the understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying IBD and provide insights for future treatment.

## Tracking cell layer contribution during repair of the tympanic membrane.
 23.02.2024, _OM Dinwoodie, AS Tucker, J Fons-Romero_


The tympanic membrane (or ear drum) sits at the interface between the middle and external ear. The membrane is composed of three layers: an outer ectodermally-derived layer, a middle neural crest-derived fibroblast layer with contribution from the mesoderm-derived vasculature, and an inner endodermally-derived mucosal layer. These layers form a thin sandwich that is often perforated as a consequence of trauma, pressure changes, or middle ear inflammation. During healing, cells need to bridge the perforation in the absence of an initial scaffold. Here we assess the contribution, timing, and interaction of the different layers during membrane repair using markers and reporter mice. We show that the ectodermal layer retracts after perforation, before proliferating away from the wound edge, with Keratin 5 basal cells migrating over the hole to bridge the gap. The mesenchymal and mucosal layers then use this scaffold to complete the repair, followed by advancement of the vasculature. Finally, differentiation of the epithelium leads to formation of a scab. Our results reveal the dynamics and interconnections between the embryonic germ layers during repair and highlight how defects might occur.

## Satisfaction Rate After Laser Correction of Presbyopia (Presbyond) Among Patients Aged 40 Years and Older in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
 23.02.2024, _TA Althomali, AN Aloufi, AA Alharbi, AH Hafiz, AH Altowairqi, MH Fattah, AK Alzahrani, RK Althomali, WK Althomali_


Background Presbyopia is a physiological condition arising due to the loss of accommodation within the crystalline lens. One of the most widely accepted theories of the mechanism of accommodation was that in response to ciliary muscle contraction, the crystalline lens thickness increases, the lens diameter decreases, and both the anterior and posterior curvature of the lens increase, resulting in an increase in lenticular power therefore, accommodation. A contrasting theory suggests that ciliary muscle contraction leads to a selective increase in equatorial zonular tension, with the lens equator moving toward the sclera and the equatorial diameter of the lens increasing. This results in a change of lens optical power. Until now, clinical approaches to correct presbyopia have included monovision, multifocality, and extended depth of focus, all three of which can be achieved surgically on the cornea or by lens surgery. Methods This was a cross-sectional study adopted among patients who had Presbyond surgery in Taif City, Saudi Arabia, and were aged 40 years and older. The data was collected by conducting phone interviews to increase the response rate with a prepared questionnaire that was studied to achieve equality between participants to determine whether they were satisfied or not about the results after this surgery. The contact information was retrieved based on hospital records about patients who underwent Presbyond surgery. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22 (Released 2013; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). The data was collected for the period beginning on the first of January 2019 until the first of February 2023. Results From the study findings, a significant number of participants (28.1%, n=25) reported experiencing complete improvement and returning to normal life within 1-30 days after surgery. A slightly larger percentage (39.2%, n=35) experienced this within 1-3 months. Most of the participants (80.9%, n=72) reported an overall improvement in their quality of life after the surgery. This included activities such as reading and using a mobile phone. This indicates that the surgery had a positive impact on their daily lives and activities. In terms of recommendations, a total of 49 (55.1%, n=49) participants stated that they were very likely to recommend refractive surgery to a family member or friend experiencing vision problems. The study found that the mean patients' satisfaction score after one month of surgery is 2.494 units higher than the mean satisfaction score before surgery. This difference was statistically significant (p &lt; .001). Conclusion The majority of participants did not experience any problems during the surgery, and most were able to resume their normal activities within a relatively brief period of time. The surgery achieved its goals for the majority of participants, resulting in an improvement in their quality of life. However, some short-term discomfort or adjustment period was reported. Overall, the participants were satisfied with the surgery, with the majority being very likely to recommend it to others. There is room for improvement in addressing concerns such as blurred vision, the need for glasses, and dry eyes. The study also found that patient satisfaction increased significantly after one month of surgery, and the timing of complete improvement and perception of achieving surgical goals were strongly associated with perceived outcomes.

## Decoding muscle-resident Schwann cell dynamics during neuromuscular junction remodeling.
 19.02.2024, _SD Guzman, A Abu-Mahfouz, CS Davis, LP Ruiz, PC Macpherson, SV Brooks_


Understanding neuromuscular junction (NMJ) repair mechanisms is essential for addressing degenerative neuromuscular conditions. Here, we focus on the role of muscle-resident Schwann cells in NMJ reinnervation. In young Sod1 -/- mice, a model of progressive NMJ degeneration, we identified a clear NMJ 'regenerative window' that allowed us to define regulators of reinnervation and crossing Sod1 -/- mice with S100GFP -tg mice permitted visualization and analysis of Schwann cells. High-resolution imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing provide a detailed analysis of Schwann cell number, morphology, and transcriptome revealing multiple subtypes, including a previously unrecognized terminal Schwann cell (tSC) population expressing a synapse promoting signature. We also discovered a novel SPP1-driven cellular interaction between myelin Schwann cells and tSCs and show that it promotes tSC proliferation and reinnervation following nerve injury in wild type mice. Our findings offer important insights into molecular regulators critical in NMJ reinnervation that are mediated through tSCs to maintain NMJ function.
