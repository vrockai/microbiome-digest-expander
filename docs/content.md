Bacterial pneumonia is a considerable problem worldwide. Here, we follow the inter-kingdom respiratory tract microbiome (RTM) of a unique cohort of 38 hospitalized patients (n = 97 samples) with pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. The RTM composition is characterized by diversity drops early in hospitalization and ecological species replacement. RTMs with the highest bacterial and fungal loads show low diversity and pathogen enrichment, suggesting high biomass as a biomarker for secondary and/or co-infections. The RTM structure is defined by a "commensal" cluster associated with a healthy RTM and a "pathogen" enriched one, suggesting that the cluster equilibrium drives the microbiome to recovery or dysbiosis. Legionella biomass correlates with disease severity and co-morbidities, while clinical interventions influence the RTM dynamics. Fungi, archaea, and protozoa seem to contribute to progress of pneumonia. Thus, the interplay of the RTM equilibrium, the pathogen load dynamics, and clinical interventions play a critical role in patient recovery.

Gut-microbiota derived metabolites are important regulators of host biology and metabolism. To understand the impacts of the microbial metabolite 4-cresol sulfate (4-CS) on four chronic diseases [type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome (MetS), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD)], we conducted association analyses of plasma 4-CS quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in 3641 participants of the Nagahama study. Our results validated the elevation of 4-CS in CKD and identified a reducing trend in MetS. To delineate the holistic effects of 4-CS, we performed a phenome-wide association analysis (PheWAS) with 937 intermediate biological and behavioral traits. We detected associations between 4-CS and 39 phenotypes related to blood pressure regulation, hepatic and renal functions, hematology, sleep quality, intraocular pressure, ion regulation, ketone and fatty acid metabolisms, disease history and dietary habits. Among them, 19 PheWAS significant traits, including fatty acids and 14 blood pressure indices, were correlated with MetS, suggesting that 4-CS is a potential biomarker for MetS. Consistent associations of this gut microbial-derived metabolite on multiple endophenotypes underlying distinct etiopathogenesis support its role in the overall host health, with prospects of probiotic-based therapeutic solutions in chronic diseases.

Background. Local recurrence and distant metastasis are the main causes of death in patients with cancer. Only considering species abundance changes when identifying markers of recurrence and metastasis in patients hinders finding solutions.Hypothesis. Consideration of microbial abundance changes and microbial interactions facilitates the identification of microbial markers of tumour recurrence and metastasis.Aim. This study aims to simultaneously consider microbial abundance changes and microbial interactions to identify microbial markers of recurrence and metastasis in multiple cancer types.Method. One thousand one hundred and six non-RM (patients without recurrence and metastasis within 3 years after initial surgery) tissue samples and 912 RM (patients with recurrence or metastasis within 3 years after initial surgery) tissue samples representing 11 cancer types were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).Results. Tumour tissue bacterial composition differed significantly among 11 cancers. Among them, the tissue microbiome of four cancers, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), showed relatively good performance in predicting recurrence and metastasis in patients, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.78, 0.74, 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. Considering both species abundance changes and microbial interactions for the four cancers, a combination of nine genera (Niastella, Schlesneria, Thioalkalivibrio, Phaeobacter, Sphaerotilus, Thiomonas, Lawsonia, Actinobacillus and Spiroplasma) performed best in predicting patient survival.Conclusion. Taken together, our results imply that comprehensive consideration of microbial abundance changes and microbial interactions is helpful for mining bacterial markers that carry prognostic information.
