## Akkermansia muciniphila: paradigm for next-generation beneficial microorganisms.
 31.05.2022, _PD Cani, C Depommier, M Derrien, A Everard, WM de Vos_


Ever since Akkermansia muciniphila was discovered and characterized two decades ago, numerous studies have shown that the lack or decreased abundance of this commensal bacterium was linked with multiple diseases (such as obesity, diabetes, liver steatosis, inflammation and response to cancer immunotherapies). Although primarily based on simple associations, there are nowadays an increasing number of studies moving from correlations to causality. The causal evidence derived from a variety of animal models performed in different laboratories and recently was also recapitulated in a human proof-of-concept trial. In this Review, we cover the history of the discovery of A. muciniphila and summarize the numerous findings and main mechanisms of action by which this intestinal symbiont improves health. A comparison of this microorganism with other next-generation beneficial microorganisms that are being developed is also made.

Viral infections are influenced by various microorganisms in the environment surrounding the target tissue, and the correlation between the type and balance of commensal microbiota is the key to establishment of the infection and pathogenicity. Some commensal microorganisms are known to resist or promote viral infection, while others are involved in pathogenicity. It is also becoming evident that the profile of the commensal microbiota under normal conditions influences the progression of viral diseases. Thus, to understand the pathogenesis underlying viral infections, it is important to elucidate the interactions among viruses, target tissues, and the surrounding environment, including the commensal microbiota, which should have different relationships with each virus. In this review, we outline the role of microorganisms in viral infections. Particularly, we focus on gaining an in-depth understanding of the correlations among viral infections, target tissues, and the surrounding environment, including the commensal microbiota and the gut virome, and discussing the impact of changes in the microbiota (dysbiosis) on the pathological progression of viral infections.

_Anti-Bacterial Agents, Bacteria, Plasmids_
SignificanceAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a great challenge for modern medicine. Plasmids are important vectors of antibiotic resistance genes. Plasmids can have context-dependent effects on their hosts, generally slowing their growth rate but also providing protection from specific antibiotics and heavy metals. Thus, models that predict population densities based on interactions between species are useful for explaining plasmid dynamics. Here, we predict with a simple ecological model the properties of a host (e.g., bacteria) and symbiont (e.g., plasmid) interaction network. Using experimental microbial communities and a conjugative plasmid, we confirm our predictions that beneficial symbionts spread more widely through a microbial community and provide key experimental results for network ecologists seeking to uncover the determinants of ecological network structure.

## Genome size distributions in bacteria and archaea are strongly linked to evolutionary history at broad phylogenetic scales.
 23.05.2022, _CA Martinez-Gutierrez, FO Aylward_


The evolutionary forces that determine genome size in bacteria and archaea have been the subject of intense debate over the last few decades. Although the preferential loss of genes observed in prokaryotes is explained through the deletional bias, factors promoting and preventing the fixation of such gene losses often remain unclear. Importantly, statistical analyses on this topic typically do not consider the potential bias introduced by the shared ancestry of many lineages, which is critical when using species as data points because of the potential dependence on residuals. In this study, we investigated the genome size distributions across a broad diversity of bacteria and archaea to evaluate if this trait is phylogenetically conserved at broad phylogenetic scales. After model fit, Pagel's lambda indicated a strong phylogenetic signal in genome size data, suggesting that the diversification of this trait is influenced by shared evolutionary histories. We used a phylogenetic generalized least-squares analysis (PGLS) to test whether phylogeny influences the predictability of genome size from dN/dS ratios and 16S copy number, two variables that have been previously linked to genome size. These results confirm that failure to account for evolutionary history can lead to biased interpretations of genome size predictors. Overall, our results indicate that although bacteria and archaea can rapidly gain and lose genetic material through gene transfers and deletions, respectively, phylogenetic signal for genome size distributions can still be recovered at broad phylogenetic scales that should be taken into account when inferring the drivers of genome size evolution.

## Interspecies commensal interactions have nonlinear impacts on host immunity.
 31.05.2022, _TA Rice, AA Bielecka, MT Nguyen, CE Rosen, D Song, ND Sonnert, Y Yang, Y Cao, V Khetrapal, JR Catanzaro, AL Martin, SA Rashed, SR Leopold, L Hao, X Yu, D van Dijk, AM Ring, RA Flavell, MR de Zoete, NW Palm_


The impacts of individual commensal microbes on immunity and disease can differ dramatically depending on the surrounding microbial context; however, the specific bacterial combinations that dictate divergent immunological outcomes remain largely undefined. Here, we characterize an immunostimulatory Allobaculum species from an inflammatory bowel disease patient that exacerbates colitis in gnotobiotic mice. Allobaculum inversely associates with the taxonomically divergent immunostimulatory species Akkermansia muciniphila in human-microbiota-associated mice and human cohorts. Co-colonization with A. muciniphila ameliorates Allobaculum-induced intestinal epithelial cell activation and colitis in mice, whereas Allobaculum blunts the A.muciniphila-specific systemic antibody response and reprograms the immunological milieu in mesenteric lymph nodes by blocking A.muciniphila-induced dendritic cell activation and T cell expansion. These studies thus identify a pairwise reciprocal interaction between human gut bacteria that dictates divergent immunological outcomes. Furthermore, they establish a generalizable framework to define the contextual cues contributing to the "incomplete penetrance" of microbial impacts on human disease.

The ichthyoses are rare genetic keratinizing disorders that share the characteristics of an impaired epidermal barrier and increased risk of microbial infections. Although ichthyotic diseases share a Th17 immune signature, including increased expression of antimicrobial peptides, the skin microbiota of ichthyoses is virtually unexplored.

Onychomycosis (OM) is a common fungal nail infection. Based on the rich mycobial diversity in healthy toenails, we speculated that this is lost in OM due to the predominance of a single pathogen. We used next generation sequencing to obtain insights into the biodiversity of fungal communities in both healthy individuals and OM patients. By sequencing, a total of 338 operational-taxonomic units were found in OM patients and healthy controls. Interestingly, a classifier distinguished three distinct subsets: healthy controls and two groups within OM patients with either a low or high abundance of Trichophyton. Diversity per sample was decreased in controls compared to cases with low Trichophyton abundance (LTA), while cases with a high Trichophyton abundance (HTA) showed a lower diversity. Variation of mycobial communities between the samples showed shifts in the community structure between cases and controls-mainly driven by HTA cases. Indeed, LTA cases had a fungal β-diversity undistinguishable from that of healthy controls. Collectively, our data provides an in-depth characterization of fungal diversity in health and OM. Our findings also suggest that onychomycosis develops either through pathogen-driven mechanisms, i.e., in HTA cases, or through host and/or environmental factors, i.e., in cases with a low Trichophyton abundance.

Low-energy diets (LEDs) comprise commercially formulated food products that provide between 800 and 1200 kcal/day (3.3-5 MJ/day) to aid body weight loss. Recent small-scale studies suggest that LEDs are associated with marked changes in the gut microbiota that may modify the effect of the LED on host metabolism and weight loss. We investigated how the gut microbiota changed during 8 weeks of total meal replacement LED and determined their associations with host response in a sub-analysis of 211 overweight adults with pre-diabetes participating in the large multicentre PREVIEW (PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle intervention and population studies In Europe and around the World) clinical trial.

## Impact of a 7-day homogeneous diet on interpersonal variation in human gut microbiomes and metabolomes.
 01.06.2022, _L Guthrie, SP Spencer, D Perelman, W Van Treuren, S Han, FB Yu, ED Sonnenburg, MA Fischbach, TW Meyer, JL Sonnenburg_


Gut microbiota metabolism of dietary compounds generates a vast array of microbiome-dependent metabolites (MDMs), which are highly variable between individuals. The uremic MDMs (uMDMs) phenylacetylglutamine (PAG), p-cresol sulfate (PCS), and indoxyl sulfate (IS) accumulate during renal failure and are associated with poor outcomes. Targeted dietary interventions may reduce toxic MDM generation; however, it is unclear if inter-individual differences in diet or gut microbiome dominantly contribute to MDM variance. Here, we use a 7-day homogeneous average American diet to standardize dietary precursor availability in 21 healthy individuals. During dietary homogeneity, the coefficient of variation in PAG, PCS, and IS (primary outcome) did not decrease, nor did inter-individual variation in most identified metabolites; other microbiome metrics showed no or modest responses to the intervention. Host identity and age are dominant contributors to variability in MDMs. These results highlight the potential need to pair dietary modification with microbial therapies to control MDM profiles.

## Discovery of bioactive microbial gene products in inflammatory bowel disease.

Microbial communities and their associated bioactive compounds1-3 are often disrupted in conditions such as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)4. However, even in well-characterized environments (for example, the human gastrointestinal tract), more than one-third of microbial proteins are uncharacterized and often expected to be bioactive5-7. Here we systematically identified more than 340,000 protein families as potentially bioactive with respect to gut inflammation during IBD, about half of which have not to our knowledge been functionally characterized previously on the basis of homology or experiment. To validate prioritized microbial proteins, we used a combination of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics to provide evidence of bioactivity for a subset of proteins that are involved in host and microbial cell-cell communication in the microbiome; for example, proteins associated with adherence or invasion processes, and extracellular von Willebrand-like factors. Predictions from high-throughput data were validated using targeted experiments that revealed the differential immunogenicity of prioritized Enterobacteriaceae pilins and the contribution of homologues of von Willebrand factors to the formation of Bacteroides biofilms in a manner dependent on mucin levels. This methodology, which we term MetaWIBELE (workflow to identify novel bioactive elements in the microbiome), is generalizable to other environmental communities and human phenotypes. The prioritized results provide thousands of candidate microbial proteins that are likely to interact with the host immune system in IBD, thus expanding our understanding of potentially bioactive gene products in chronic disease states and offering a rational compendium of possible therapeutic compounds and targets.

Termites primarily feed on lignocellulose or soil in association with specific gut microbes. The functioning of the termite gut microbiota is partly understood in a handful of wood-feeding pest species but remains largely unknown in other taxa. We intend to fill this gap and provide a global understanding of the functional evolution of termite gut microbiota.

## Markers of oxidative stress in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome.
 01.06.2022, _A Montoya-Estrada, DB Veruete-Bedolla, J Romo-Yañez, GF Ortiz-Luna, A Arellano-Eguiluz, N Najéra, G Ceballos, NG Nieto-Velázquez, MA Ramos-Valencia, N Cariño-Mancilla, NL Valdez-Rodríguez, A Flores-Pliego, A Espejel-Nuñez, E Reyes-Muñoz_


During the postmenopausal period, there are metabolic alterations that predispose individuals to metabolic syndrome (MS), oxidative stress (OS), and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to compare the concentrations of OS markers in postmenopausal women with and without MS. Malondialdehyde, carbonyl groups, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were quantified. We conducted a cross-sectional study: Group 1 (n = 42) included women without MS, and Group 2 (n = 58) comprised women with MS. Participants' age was similar between groups. Glucose, insulin, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides, uric acid, and body mass index were significantly lower in postmenopausal women without MS. OS markers were significantly lower in Group 1 vs. Group 2: malondialdehyde, 31.32 ± 14.93 vs. 40.27 ± 17.62 pmol MDA/mg dry weight (p = .01); protein carbonylation, 6325 ± 1551 vs. 7163 ± 1029 pmol PC/mg protein (p = .0003); and TAC, 1497 ± 297.3 vs. 1619 ± 278.8 pmol Trolox equivalent/mg protein (p = .041). OS markers were significantly higher in postmenopausal women with MS. Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Oxidative stress has been implicated in numerous disease processes; however, information on the relationship between oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome among postmenopausal women remains limited.What do the results of this study add? Our results indicate that in postmenopausal Mexican women, oxidative stress markers were significantly lower in those without metabolic syndrome, whereas total antioxidant capacity was higher in those with metabolic syndrome, which could be explained as an antioxidant defense mechanism capable of neutralising excess oxidative damage markers.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? This study is of interest to a broad audience because it compares the concentrations of oxidative stress markers in postmenopausal women with and without metabolic syndrome. Our study could support intervention with supplements or foods rich in antioxidants as lifestyle modifications in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome.

## Mapping phyllosphere microbiota interactions in planta to establish genotype-phenotype relationships.
 01.06.2022, _M Schäfer, CM Vogel, M Bortfeld-Miller, M Mittelviefhaus, JA Vorholt_


Host-associated microbiomes harbour hundreds of bacterial species that co-occur, creating the opportunity for manifold bacteria-bacteria interactions, which in turn contribute to the overall community structure. The mechanisms that underlie this self-organization among bacteria remain largely elusive. Here, we studied bacterial interactions in the phyllosphere microbiota. We screened for microbial interactions in planta by adding 200 endogenous strains individually to a 15-member synthetic community and tracking changes in community composition upon colonization of the model plant Arabidopsis. Ninety percent of the identified interactions in planta were negative, and phylogenetically closely related strains elicited consistent effects on the synthetic community, providing support for trait conservation. Community changes could be largely explained by binary interactions; however, we also identified a higher-order interaction of more than two interacting strains. We further focused on a prominent interaction between two members of the Actinobacteria. In the presence of Aeromicrobium Leaf245, the population of Nocardioides Leaf374 was reduced by almost two orders of magnitude. We identified a potent antimicrobial peptidase in Aeromicrobium Leaf245, which resulted in Nocardioides Leaf374 lysis. A respective Leaf245 mutant strain was necessary and sufficient to restore Nocardioides colonization in planta, demonstrating that direct bacteria-bacteria interactions were responsible for the population shift originally observed. Our study highlights the power of synthetic community screening and uncovers a strong microbial interaction that occurs despite a spatially heterogeneous environment.

## Polyploidy and microbiome associations mediate similar responses to pathogens in Arabidopsis.
 31.05.2022, _EC Mehlferber, MJ Song, JN Pelaez, J Jaenisch, JE Coate, B Koskella, CJ Rothfels_


It has become increasingly clear that the microbiome plays a critical role in shaping the host organism's response to disease. There also exists mounting evidence that an organism's ploidy level is important in their response to pathogens and parasites. However, no study has determined whether or how these two factors influence one another. We investigate the effect of whole-genome duplication in Arabidopsis thaliana on the above-ground (phyllosphere) microbiome and determine the interacting impacts of ploidy and microbiome on disease outcome. Using seven independently derived synthetic autotetraploid Arabidopsis accessions and a synthetic leaf-associated bacterial community, we confirm that polyploids are generally more resistant to the model pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tomato DC3000. Polyploids fare better against the pathogen than diploids do, regardless of microbial inoculation, whereas diploids harboring an intact microbiome have lower pathogen densities than those without. In addition, diploids have elevated numbers of defense-related genes that are differentially expressed in the presence of their phyllosphere microbiota, whereas polyploids exhibit some constitutively activated defenses, regardless of colonization by the synthetic community. These results imply that whole-genome duplication can enhance immunity, resulting in a decreased dependence on the microbiome for protection against pathogens.
