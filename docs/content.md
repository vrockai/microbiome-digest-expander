The human vagina harbor a rich microbiota. The optimal state is dominated by lactobacilli that help to maintain health and prevent various diseases. However, the microbiota may rapidly change to a polymicrobial state that has been linked to a number of diseases. In the present study, the temporal changes of the vaginal microbiota in patients treated for sexually transmitted diseases or bacterial vaginosis (BV) and in untreated controls were studied for 26 days. The patients included 52 women treated with azithromycin, tetracyclines or moxifloxacin for present or suspected infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Mycoplasma genitalium. Women with concurrent BV were also treated with metronidazole. The controls were 10 healthy women of matching age. The microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing, specific qPCRs and microscopy. There was generally good correlation between Nugent score and community state type (CST) and qPCR confirmed the sequencing results. By sequencing, more than 600 different taxa were found, but only 33 constituted more than 1 ‰ of the sequences. In both patients and controls the microbiota could be divided into three different community state types, CST-I, CST-III and CST-IV. Without metronidazole, the microbiota remained relatively stable regarding CST although changes were seen during menstrual periods. Administration of metronidazole changed the microbiota from CST-IV to CST-III in approximately 50% of the treated patients. In contrast, the CST was generally unaffected by azithromycin or tetracyclines. In 30% of the BV patients, Gardnerella vaginalis was not eradicated by metronidazole. The majority of women colonized with Ureaplasma parvum remained positive after azithromycin while U. urealyticum was eradicated.

## [Intestinal microbiom modulates the response to antitumor immunotherapy].

Numerous studies confirm the high degree of involvement of the intestinal microbiota in most processes in the human body. There is evidence for the effect of intestinal microbiota on the success of chemo and immunotherapy of oncological diseases. It is assumed that the intestinal microbiota exhibits an indirect effect on the antitumor therapy through such mechanisms as general immunomodulation, an increase in cells that specifically respond to antigens of both microbial and tumor origin, metabolism, degradation (utilization) of drug compounds. The intestinal microbiota is currently considered as an additional, but important target for studying the effective use of antitumor therapy and reducing its toxicity, as well as a predictor of the success of immunotherapy. In this review, we highlight the results of studies published to date that confirm the relationship between gut microbiome and antitumor efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Despite the promising and theoretically substantiated conclusions, there are still some discrepancies among the existing data that will have to be addressed in order to facilitate the further development of this direction.

## Healthy Human Gastrointestinal Microbiome: Composition and Function After a Decade of Exploration.
 28.07.2020, _W Ruan, MA Engevik, JK Spinler, J Versalovic_


_Biomedical Research, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Gastrointestinal Tract, Health Status, Humans, Microbiota_
The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains communities of microbes (bacteria, fungi, viruses) that vary by anatomic location and impact human health. Microbial communities differ in composition based on age, diet, and location in the gastrointestinal tract. Differences in microbial composition have been associated with chronic disease states. In terms of function, microbial metabolites provide key signals that help maintain healthy human physiology. Alterations of the healthy gastrointestinal microbiome have been linked to the development of various disease states including inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and colorectal cancer. While the definition of a healthy GI microbiome cannot be precisely identified, features of a healthy gut microbiome include relatively greater biodiversity and relative abundances of specific phyla and genera. Microbes with desirable functional profiles for the human host have been identified, in addition to specific metabolic features of the microbiome. This article reviews the composition and function of the healthy human GI microbiome, including the relative abundances of different bacterial taxa and the specific metabolic pathways and classes of microbial metabolites contributing to human health and disease prevention.

## Sleep and Microbiome in Psychiatric Diseases.

Disturbances in the gut-brain barrier play an essential role in the development of mental disorders. There is considerable evidence showing that the gut microbiome not only affects digestive, metabolic and immune functions of the host but also regulates host sleep and mental states through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The present review summarizes the role of the gut microbiome in the context of circadian rhythms, nutrition and sleep in psychiatric disorders.

## Diet and Gut Microbes Act Coordinately to Enhance Programmed Cell Death and Reduce Colorectal Cancer Risk.
 28.07.2020, _RS Chapkin, SL Navarro, MAJ Hullar, JW Lampe_


_Animals, Apoptosis, Colorectal Neoplasms, Diet, Diet Therapy, Dietary Fiber, Fatty Acids, Omega-3, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans_
Diet is an important risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC), and several dietary constituents implicated in CRC are modified by gut microbial metabolism. Microbial fermentation of dietary fiber produces short-chain fatty acids, e.g., acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Dietary fiber has been shown to reduce colon tumors in animal models, and, in vitro, butyrate influences cellular pathways important to cancer risk. Furthermore, work from our group suggests that the combined effects of butyrate and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) may enhance the chemopreventive potential of these dietary constituents. We postulate that the relatively low intakes of n-3 PUFA and fiber in Western populations and the failure to address interactions between these dietary components may explain why chemoprotective effects of n-3 PUFA and fermentable fibers have not been detected consistently in prospective cohort studies. In this review, we summarize the evidence outlining the effects of n-3 long-chain PUFA and highly fermentable fiber with respect to alterations in critical pathways important to CRC prevention, particularly intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated programmed cell death resulting from the accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ferroptosis), and epigenetic programming related to lipid catabolism and beta-oxidation-associated genes.

## Diversity of Gut Microbiota and Bifidobacterial Community of Chinese Subjects of Different Ages and from Different Regions.
 29.07.2020, _B Yang, S Yan, Y Chen, RP Ross, C Stanton, J Zhao, H Zhang, W Chen_


Gut microbiota composition and functionality are closely linked to host health. In this study, the fecal microbiota and bifidobacterial communities of 111 healthy volunteers from four regions of China of varying age profiles (Child, 1-5 years; Young, 18-50 years; Elder, 60-80 years; Longevity, ≥90 years) were investigated via high-throughput sequencing. Canonical analysis revealed that the gut microbiota, as well as bifidobacteria profiles of the subjects, clustered according to their regions and age. Eight genera were shared among all subjects, however, certain genera distributed differently in subjects grouped by region and age. Faecalibacterium was enriched in samples from Zhongxiang, unclassified Ruminococcaceae and Christensenellaceae were enriched in the Longevity group, and Bifidobacterium was enriched in Child. Within Bifidobacterium, B. longum was the most abundant species in almost all samples except for Child, in which B. pseudocatenulatum was the most abundant. Additionally, the abundances of B. adolescentis and B. dentium were lower in Child. In conclusion, our results suggest that geography and age affect the structure of the gut microbiota, as well as Bifidobacterium composition, and this variation may greatly associate with the metabolic and immune changes that occur during the process of aging.
