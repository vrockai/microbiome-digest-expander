Gingivitis-the inflammation of the gums-is a reversible stage of periodontal disease. It is caused by dental plaque formation due to poor oral hygiene. However, gingivitis susceptibility involves a complex set of interactions between the oral microbiome, oral metabolome and the host. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of the oral microbiome and its interactions with the salivary metabolome during experimental gingivitis in a cohort of 41 systemically healthy participants. We use Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC), which is a multi-way generalization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that can model the variability in the response due to subjects, variables and time. Using the modelled responses, we identified microbial subcommunities with similar dynamics that connect to the magnitude of the gingivitis response. By performing high level integration of the predicted metabolic functions of the microbiome and salivary metabolome, we identified pathways of interest that describe the changing proportions of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microbiota, variation in anaerobic bacteria, biofilm formation and virulence.

## Establishing human microbial observatory programs in low- and middle-income countries.
 19.09.2024, _JI Gordon, MJ Barratt, MC Hibberd, M Rahman, T Ahmed_


Studies of the human microbiome are progressing rapidly but have largely focused on populations living in high-income countries. With increasing evidence that the microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases that affect infants, children, and adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and with profound and rapid ongoing changes occurring in our lifestyles and biosphere, understanding the origins of and developing microbiome-directed therapeutics for treating a number of global health challenges requires the development of programs for studying human microbial ecology in LMICs. Here, we discuss how the establishment of long-term human microbial observatory programs in selected LMICs could provide one timely approach.

## Bacterial Extracellular Vesicles as Potential Promoting Factors for Oral Lichen Planus Pathogenesis.
 21.09.2024, _YG Kim, HJ Song, HJ Kim, BK Joo, JH Cho, W Jung, S Jang, SY Choi, HJ Lee, JS Byun, DY Kim_


Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by an intensive infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, which causes keratinocyte death. Abnormal changes within keratinocytes might be critical for OLP onset and progression, but the pathogenic mechanism of OLP is still uncertain. The human oral microbiota, consisting of approximately 50-100 billion bacterial entities, encompasses around 200 dominant bacterial species. These bacteria continuously produce and release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which play a significant role in host-microbe interactions. However, the impact of these bacterial EVs on the progression of OLP has not been fully elucidated. In this study, through comprehensive database analysis and experimental validation, we observed that OLP lesions exhibit elevated inflammatory signatures and significantly increased phosphorylation of STAT3 compared to non-OLP tissues. Notably, EVs derived from key periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were shown to induce an inflammatory response and activate STAT3 signaling pathways, closely mirroring the pathophysiological features observed in OLP. These results underscore the potential role of bacterial EVs in the pathogenesis of OLP and highlight STAT3 as a critical mediator in this process.

## Gut microbiota metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide promoted NAFLD progression by exacerbating intestinal barrier disruption and intrahepatic cellular imbalance.
 19.09.2024, _F Nian, Y Chen, Q Xia, C Zhu, L Wu, X Lu_


Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, with the gut microbiota and its metabolites are important regulators of its progression. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite of the gut microbiota, has been closely associated with various metabolic diseases, but its relationship with NAFLD remains to be elucidated. In this study, we found that fecal TMAO levels correlated with NAFLD severity. Moreover, TMAO promoted lipid deposition in HepG2 fatty liver cells and exacerbated hepatic steatosis in NAFLD rats. In the colon, TMAO undermined the structure and function of the intestinal barrier at various levels, further activated the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, and inhibited the WNT/β-catenin pathway. In the liver, TMAO induced endothelial dysfunction with capillarization of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, while modulating macrophage polarization. In conclusion, our study suggests that gut microbiota metabolite TMAO promotes NAFLD progression by impairing the gut and liver and that targeting TMAO could be an alternative therapeutic strategy for NAFLD.

## Microbiota-gut-brain axis in health and neurological disease: Interactions between gut microbiota and the nervous system.
 22.09.2024, _Y He, K Wang, N Su, C Yuan, N Zhang, X Hu, Y Fu, F Zhao_

Along with mounting evidence that gut microbiota and their metabolites migrate endogenously to distal organs, the 'gut-lung axis,' 'gut-brain axis,' 'gut-liver axis' and 'gut-renal axis' have been established. Multiple animal recent studies have demonstrated gut microbiota may also be a key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and autism. The gastrointestinal tract is innervated by the extrinsic sympathetic and vagal nerves and the intrinsic enteric nervous system, and the gut microbiota interacts with the nervous system to maintain homeostatic balance in the host gut. A total of 1507 publications on the interactions between the gut microbiota, the gut-brain axis and neurological disorders are retrieved from the Web of Science to investigate the interactions between the gut microbiota and the nervous system and the underlying mechanisms involved in normal and disease states. We provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of the gut microbiota and its metabolites on nervous system function and neurotransmitter secretion, as well as alterations in the gut microbiota in neurological disorders, to provide a basis for the possibility of targeting the gut microbiota as a therapeutic agent for neurological disorders.

## 2'-Fucosyllactose attenuates aging-related metabolic disorders through modulating gut microbiome-T cell axis.
 20.09.2024, _A Li, R Kou, R Wang, J Wang, B Zhang, J Liu, Y Hu, S Wang_


Aging-related metabolic disorders seriously affect the lifespan of middle-aged and older people, potentially due to disruptions in the adaptive immune and gut microbial profiles. Dietary intervention offers a promising strategy for maintaining metabolic health. This study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) on aging-induced metabolic dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms. The results revealed that 2'-FL significantly relieved aging-related metabolic disorders, including weight gain, lipid deposition, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, systemic inflammation, and abnormal hepatic metabolism. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant reduction in T cytotoxic (Tc), T helper (Th), and regulatory T (Treg) cells and a significant increase in Th17 cells in aged mice, while 2'-FL relieved the aging-induced proportional changes in Th and Th17 subtypes. The aging intestinal microecology was characterized by higher Th17/Treg ratios, impaired gut barrier function, lower gut bacterial diversity, decreased abundance of beneficial genera including Ligilactobacillus, Colidextribacter, Mucispirillum, and Lachnoclostridium, and increased abundance of harmful bacteria including Turicibacter and Desulfovibrio, which was ameliorated by 2'-FL treatment. These findings highlight that 2'-FL is an ideal dietary prebiotic for improving aging-related metabolic disorders by modulating both the adaptive immune system and the gut microbial profile.

The decrease in sperm count and infertility is a global issue that remains unresolved. By screening environmental bacterial isolates, we have found that a novel lactic acid bacterium, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SNI3, increased testis size, testosterone levels, sperm count, sexual activity and fertility in mice that have consumed the bacteria for four weeks. The abundance of L. plantarum in the colon microbiome was positively associated with sperm count. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from L. plantarum SNI3-dosed mice improved testicular functions in microbiome-attenuated recipient animals. To identify mediators that confer pro-reproductive effects on the host, untargeted in situ mass spectrometry metabolomics was performed on testis samples of L. plantarum SNI3-treated and control mice. Enrichment pathway analysis revealed several perturbed metabolic pathways in the testis of treated mice. Within the testis, a dipeptide, glutamyl-glutamate (GluGlu) was the most upregulated metabolite following L. plantarum SNI3 administration. To validate the pro-reproductive feature of GluGlu, systemic and local injections of the dipeptide have been performed. γ-GluGlu increased sperm count but had no effect on testosterone. These findings highlight the role of γ-GluGlu in mediating spermatogenetic effects of L. plantarum on the male mouse host and -following relevant human clinical trials- may provide future tools for treating certain forms of male infertility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a leading cause of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), with gender-specific differences in susceptibility. However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. Our study reveals that the gender-specific differences in susceptibility to APAP-induced hepatotoxicity are due to differences in the gut microbiota. Through microbial multi-omics and cultivation, we observed increased gut microbiota-derived deguelin content in both women and female mice. Administration of deguelin was capable of alleviating hepatotoxicity in APAP-treated male mice, and this protective effect was associated with the inhibition of hepatocyte oxidative stress. Mechanistically, deguelin reduced the expression of thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) in hepatocytes with APAP treatment through direct interaction. Pharmacologic suppression of TSHR expression using ML224 significantly increased hepatic glutathione (GSH) in APAP-treated male mice. These findings suggest that gut microbiota-derived deguelin plays a crucial role in reducing APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in female mice, offering new insights into therapeutic strategies for DILI.

## Metformin reprograms tryptophan metabolism via gut Microbiome-Derived bile acid metabolites to ameliorate Depression-Like behaviors in mice.
 20.09.2024, _X Xie, W Li, Z Xiong, J Xu, T Liao, L Sun, H Xu, M Zhang, J Zhou, W Xiong, Z Fu, Z Li, Q Han, D Cui, DC Anthony_


As an adjunct therapy, metformin enhances the efficacy of conventional antidepressant medications. However, its mode of action remains unclear. Here, metformin was found to ameliorate depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS) by normalizing the dysbiotic gut microbiome. Fecal transplants from metformin-treated mice ameliorated depressive behaviors in stressed mice. Microbiome profiling revealed that Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), in particular, was markedly increased in the gut by metformin and that oral administration of this species alone was sufficient to reverse CRS-induced depressive behaviors and normalize aberrant stress-induced 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism in the brain and gut. Untargeted metabolomic profiling further identified the bile acid metabolites taurocholate and deoxycholic acid as direct A. muciniphila-derived molecules that are, individually, sufficient to rescue the CRS-induced impaired 5-HT metabolism and depression-like behaviors. Thus, we report metformin reprograms 5-HT metabolism via microbiome-brain interactions to mitigate depressive syndromes, providing novel insights into gut microbiota-derived bile acids as potential therapeutic candidates for depressive mood disorders from bench to bedside.

## Dynamics of the microbiome and volatile organic compounds during fermentation and aging of soy sauce.
 20.09.2024, _Y Mizuno, T Yoshimura, K Sawada, K Tsuge, Y Nagano, Y Yoshizaki, M Goto, G Kobayashi_


A comprehensive analysis of the microbiome and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the moromi of soy sauce during fermentation and aging was conducted under industrial production. Microbiome analysis using next-generation sequencing revealed the presence and dynamics of microorganisms other than Aspergillus, Tetragenococcus, Zygosaccharomyces, and Wickerhamiella, which were used as starters. The bacterial community of the moromi on the first day of this process was rich in diversity. Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Kurthia, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus, and Macrococcus that grew during koji making were relatively dominant. However, as the fermentation progressed, only Tetragenococcus became dominant in the bacterial communities. In contrast, the fungal community was simple at the beginning of fermentation and aging, with Aspergillus present almost exclusively. After adding Zygosaccharomyces rouxii on day 42, the fungal community changed significantly. At the end of fermentation and aging, the fungal community diversified, with Millerozyma, Wickerhamiella, Yamadazyma, and Saccharomycopsis becoming dominant. The analysis of VOC showed that the VOC profile changed during fermentation and aging, and that the VOC profile changed significantly after adding Z. rouxii. The correlation analysis between the microbiome and VOC showed that Wickerhamiella, Millerozyma, Debaryomyces, Yamadazyma, and Candida had a significant positive correlation with alcohols, esters, and phenols produced in the later stage of fermentation and aging, indicating that not only Z. rouxii but also various fungi may contribute to the formation of the complex aroma profile of soy sauce.

## Pseudomonas fluorescens Inoculation Enhances Salix matsudana Growth by Modifying Phyllosphere Microbiomes, Surpassing Nitrogen Fertilization.
 20.09.2024, _Q Li, Y He, J Feng, Y He, S Zhang_


The enhancement of plant growth by soil fertilization and microbial inoculation involves different mechanisms, particularly by altering the phyllosphere microbiome. This study investigated how nitrogen (N) fertilization, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain R124 inoculation and their combined effects influence the growth of different-aged Salix matsudana cuttings by modulating N dynamics within the phyllosphere microbiome. Results showed that P. fluorescens inoculation was significantly more effective than N fertilization alone, enhancing biomass, plant nutrient uptake, soil nutrient content and root development by 90.51%, 18.18%, 72.74% and 126.20%, respectively. Crucially, the inoculation notably shifted the beta-diversity of the phyllosphere microbial community, with K-strategy fungi enhancing plant N fixation and subsequent plant growth. Cuttings from middle-aged forests displayed more robust growth than those from young-aged, associated with a varied impact on phyllosphere fungi, notably increasing the relative abundance of Myriangiales in young (76.37%) and Capnodiales in middle-aged cuttings (42.37%), which improve phyllosphere stability and plant health. These findings highlight the effectiveness of microbial inoculation over N fertilization in promoting plant growth and provide valuable insights for the sustainable management of willow plantations at different stages of development.

## Deep insights into the assembly mechanisms, co-occurrence patterns, and functional roles of microbial community in wastewater treatment plants.
 20.09.2024, _ZY Wei, M Feng, DX Zhang, CY Jiang, Y Deng, ZJ Wang, K Feng, Y Song, N Zhou, YL Wang, SJ Liu_


The understanding of activated sludge microbial status and roles is imperative for improving and enhancing the performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, we conducted a deep analysis of activated sludge microbial communities across five compartments (inflow, effluent, and aerobic, anoxic, anaerobic tanks) over temporal scales, employing high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons and metagenome data. Clearly discernible seasonal patterns, exhibiting cyclic variations, were observed in microbial diversity, assembly, co-occurrence network, and metabolic functions. Notably, summer samples exhibited higher α-diversity and were distinctly separated from winter samples. Our analysis revealed that microbial community assembly is influenced by both stochastic processes (66%) and deterministic processes (34%), with winter samples demonstrating more random assembly compared to summer. Co-occurrence patterns were predominantly mutualistic, with over 96% positive correlations, and summer networks were more organized than those in winter. These variations were significantly correlated with temperature, total phosphorus and sludge volume index. However, no significant differences were found among microbial community across five compartments in terms of β diversity. A core community of keystone taxa was identified, playing key roles in eight nitrogen and eleven phosphorus cycling pathways. Understanding the assembly mechanisms, co-occurrence patterns, and functional roles of microbial communities is essential for the design and optimization of biotechnological treatment processes in WWTPs.

Geothermal features in Antarctica provide favorable conditions for diverse microorganisms, yet their genomic diversity remains poorly understood. Here, we present an integrated dataset comprising PacBio HiFi and Hi-C metagenomic sequencing, along with single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) from two high-altitude geothermal sites, Mount Melbourne and Mount Rittmann, in Antarctica. The long-read HiFi sequencing, coupled with Hi-C, enhances the understanding of microbiome diversity and functionality in this unique ecosystem by providing more complete and accurate genomic information. SAGs complement this by recovering rare microbial taxa and offering a strain-resolved perspective. This dataset aims to deepen our understanding of microbial evolution and ecology in Antarctic geothermal environments, and facilitate cross-comparison with other geothermal environments globally.
