Over-accumulation of oxalate in humans may lead to nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. Humans lack endogenous oxalate degradation pathways (ODP), but intestinal microbes can degrade oxalate using multiple ODPs and protect against its absorption. The exact oxalate-degrading taxa in the human microbiota and their ODP have not been described. We leverage multi-omics data (&gt;3000 samples from &gt;1000 subjects) to show that the human microbiota primarily uses the type II ODP, rather than type I. Further, among the diverse ODP-encoding microbes, an oxalate autotroph, Oxalobacter formigenes, dominates this function transcriptionally. Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) frequently suffer from disrupted oxalate homeostasis and calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. We show that the enteric oxalate level is elevated in IBD patients, with highest levels in Crohn's disease patients with both ileal and colonic involvement consistent with known nephrolithiasis risk. We show that the microbiota ODP expression is reduced in IBD patients, which may contribute to the disrupted oxalate homeostasis. The specific changes in ODP expression by several important taxa suggest that they play distinct roles in IBD-induced nephrolithiasis risk. Lastly, we colonize mice that are maintained in the gnotobiotic facility with O. formigenes, using either a laboratory isolate or an isolate we cultured from human stools, and observed a significant reduction in host fecal and urine oxalate levels, supporting our in silico prediction of the importance of the microbiome, particularly O. formigenes in host oxalate homeostasis.

Data regarding the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on host-microbiome alteration and subsequent effects on susceptibility and clinical course of COVID-19, especially in atopic patients, are currently limited. Here, we review the studies regarding the microbiome of atopic patients with other respiratory infections and discuss the potential role of probiotics as therapeutic targets for COVID-19 to decrease its susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.

Strict anaerobes are undeniably important residents of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung but are still unknowns. The main objectives of this study were to describe anaerobic bacteria diversity in CF airway microbiota and to evaluate the association with lung function. An observational study was conducted during eight months. A hundred and one patients were enrolled in the study, and 150 sputum samples were collected using a sterile sample kit designed to preserve anaerobic conditions. An extended-culture approach on 112 sputa and a molecular approach (quantitative PCR targeting three of the main anaerobic genera in CF lung: Prevotella, Veillonella, and Fusobacterium) on 141 sputa were developed. On culture, 91.1% of sputa were positive for at least one anaerobic bacterial species, with an average of six anaerobic species detected per sputum. Thirty-one anaerobic genera and 69 species were found, which is the largest anaerobe diversity ever reported in CF lungs. Better lung function (defined as Forced Expiratory Volume in one second &gt; 70%) was significantly associated with higher quantification of Veillonella. These results raise the question of the potential impact of anaerobes on lung function.

## The Role of Mucosal Immunity and Recombinant Probiotics in SARS-CoV2 Vaccine Development.
 26.03.2021, _S Moradi-Kalbolandi, K Majidzadeh-A, MH Abdolvahab, N Jalili, L Farahmand_


Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), causing the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), was introduced by WHO (World Health Organization) as "pandemic" in March 2020. According to WHO, thus far (23 November 2020) 58,425,681 infected cases including 1,385,218 deaths have been reported worldwide. In order to reduce transmission and spread of this lethal virus, attempts are globally being made to develop an appropriate vaccine. Intending to neutralize pathogens at their initial entrance site, protective mucosal immunity is inevitably required. In SARS-CoV2 infection and transmission, respiratory mucosa plays a key role; hence, apparently mucosal vaccination could be a superior approach to elicit mucosal and systemic immune responses simultaneously. In this review, the advantages of mucosal vaccination to control COVID-19 infection, limitations, and outcomes of mucosal vaccines have been highlighted. Considering the gut microbiota dysregulation in COVID-19, we further provide evidences on utilization of recombinant probiotics, particularly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as vaccine carrier. Their intrinsic immunomodulatory features, natural adjuvanticity, and feasible expression of relevant antigen in the mucosal surface make them more appealing as live cell factory. Among all available platforms, bioengineered probiotics are considered as the most affordable, most practical, and safest vaccination approach to halt this emerging virus.

## Propionate catabolism by CD-associated adherent-invasive E. coli counteracts its anti-inflammatory effect.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic and disabling inflammatory disorder of the gut that is profoundly influenced by intestinal microbiota composition, host genetics and environmental factors. Several groups worldwide have described an imbalance of the gut microbiome composition, called dysbiosis, in CD patients, with an increase in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and a decrease in Firmicutes. A high prevalence of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) pathobionts has been identified in the intestinal mucosa of CD patients. A significant loss in the bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) with anti-inflammatory properties, such as propionate, is also a consequence of dysbiosis in CD patients. Here, the AIEC reference strain LF82 was able to degrade propionate in the gut, which was sufficient to counteract the anti-inflammatory effect of propionate both in in vitro models and in mice with DSS-induced colitis. The consumption of propionate by AIEC pathobionts leads to an increase in TNF-α production by macrophages upon infection through the bacterial methyl-citrate pathway. To induce the protective effects of SCFAs on the inflamed gut, we used a G-protein-coupled receptor 43 agonist (GPR43 agonist) that is not metabolizable by intestinal bacteria. Interestingly, this agonist showed anti-inflammatory properties and decreased the severity of colitis in AIEC-infected mice, as assessed by an improvement in the disease activity index (DAI) and a decrease in AIEC pathobiont encroachment. Taken together, these results highlight the effectiveness of GPR43 agonist treatment in the control of gut inflammation and improved our understanding of the ability of AIEC to modulate propionate availability to create an infectious niche to its advantage.

## Metabolic Syndrome Cannot Mask the Changes of Fecal Microbiota Compositions Caused by Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
 26.03.2021, _J Ni, C Fu, R Huang, Z Li, S Li, P Cao, K Zhong, M Ge, Y Gao_


Both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metabolic syndrome are closely associated with the composition of the gut microbiota (GM). Although it has been proposed that elements of the GM can be used as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of HCC, whether metabolic syndrome results in a misrepresentation of the results of the early diagnosis of HCC using GM remains unclear. We compared the differences in the fecal microbiota of 10 patients with primary HCC, 6 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 7 patients with arterial hypertension, 6 patients with both HCC and T2DM, and 10 patients with both HCC and arterial hypertension, as well as 10 healthy subjects, using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Our results revealed a significant difference in the GM between subjects with and without HCC. There 49 bacterial genera out of the 494 detected genera were significantly different between the groups. These results show that changes in the GM can be used to distinguish between subjects with and without HCC, and can resist interference of T2DM and arterial hypertension with the GM. The results of the present study provide an important basis for the clinical auxiliary diagnosis of HCC by detecting the GM.

Animals in the wild are able to subsist on pathogen-infected and poisonous food and show immunity to various diseases. These may be due to their microbiota, yet we have a poor understanding of animal microbial diversity and function. We used metagenomics to analyze the gut microbiota of over 180 species in the wild, covering diverse classes, feeding behaviors, geographies, and traits. Using de novo metagenome assembly, we constructed and functionally annotated a database of over 5,000 genomes, comprising 1,209 bacterial species of which 75% are unknown. The microbial composition, diversity, and functional content exhibit associations with animal taxonomy, diet, activity, social structure and lifespan. We identify the gut microbiota of wild animals as a largely untapped resource for the discovery of therapeutics and biotechnology applications.

## Preliminary functional analysis of the subgingival microbiota of cats with periodontitis and feline chronic gingivostomatitis.
 26.03.2021, _MX Rodrigues, N Fiani, RC Bicalho, S Peralta_


The subgingival microbial communities of domestic cats remain incompletely characterized and it is unknown whether their functional profiles are associated with disease. In this study, we used a shotgun metagenomic approach to explore the functional potential of subgingival microbial communities in client-owned cats, comparing findings between periodontally healthy cats and cats with naturally occurring chronic periodontitis, aggressive periodontitis, and feline chronic gingivostomatitis. Subgingival samples were subjected to shotgun sequencing and the metagenomic datasets were analyzed using the MG-RAST metagenomic analysis server and STAMP v2.1.3 (Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic Profiles) software. The microbial composition was also described to better understand the predicted features of the communities. The Respiration category in the level 1 Subsystems database varied significantly among groups. In this category, the abundance of V-Type ATP-synthase and Biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidases were significantly enriched in the diseased and in the healthy groups, respectively. Both features have been previously described in periodontal studies in people and are in consonance with the microbial composition of feline subgingival sites. In addition, the narH (nitrate reductase) gene frequency, identified using the KEGG Orthology database, was significantly increased in the healthy group. The results of this study provide preliminary functional insights of the microbial communities associated with periodontitis in domestic cats and suggest that the ATP-synthase and nitrate-nitrite-NO pathways may represent appropriate targets for the treatment of this common disease.

## No hints at glyphosate-induced ruminal dysbiosis in cows.

Glyphosate-based herbicides are among the most used non-selective herbicides worldwide and inhibit synthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants, bacteria, and fungi. Given the broad usage, controversies concerning potential effects of glyphosate on health and especially on gut microbiomes arose. For cattle, it has been proposed based on in vitro data that glyphosate has detrimental effects on the ruminal microbiome, which manifest as a specific inhibition of bacteria involved in fiber degradation and as an enrichment of specific pathogens. In the present study, glyphosate effects on the ruminal microbiome were analyzed in vivo using glyphosate contaminated feedstuffs with strong differences in dietary fiber and dietary energy content in order to reproduce the proposed detrimental glyphosate effects on the rumen microbiome. While significant impact of dietary factors on the ruminal microbiome and its products are pointed out, no adverse glyphosate effects on ruminal microbiome composition, diversity, and microbial metabolites are observed.

## Effects of Microbiota Imbalance in Anxiety and Eating Disorders: Probiotics as Novel Therapeutic Approaches.
 17.03.2021, _E Navarro-Tapia, L Almeida-Toledano, G Sebastiani, M Serra-Delgado, Ó García-Algar, V Andreu-Fernández_


Anxiety and eating disorders produce a physiological imbalance that triggers alterations in the abundance and composition of gut microbiota. Moreover, the gut-brain axis can be altered by several factors such as diet, lifestyle, infections, and antibiotic treatment. Diet alterations generate gut dysbiosis, which affects immune system responses, inflammation mechanisms, the intestinal permeability, as well as the production of short chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters by gut microbiota, which are essential to the correct function of neurological processes. Recent studies indicated that patients with generalized anxiety or eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorders) show a specific profile of gut microbiota, and this imbalance can be partially restored after a single or multi-strain probiotic supplementation. Following the PRISMA methodology, the current review addresses the main microbial signatures observed in patients with generalized anxiety and/or eating disorders as well as the importance of probiotics as a preventive or a therapeutic tool in these pathologies.

## Invasive freshwater snails form novel microbial relationships.
 26.03.2021, _L Bankers, D Dahan, M Neiman, C Adrian-Tucci, C Frost, GDD Hurst, KC King_


Resident microbes (microbiota) can shape host organismal function and adaptation in the face of environmental change. Invasion of new habitats exposes hosts to novel selection pressures, but little is known about the impact on microbiota and the host-microbiome relationship (e.g., how rapidly new microbial associations are formed, whether microbes influence invasion success). We used high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of New Zealand (native) and European (invasive) populations of the freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum and found that while invaders do carry over some core microbial taxa from New Zealand, their microbial community is largely distinct. This finding highlights that invasions can result in the formation of novel host-microbiome relationships. We further show that the native microbiome is composed of fewer core microbes than the microbiome of invasive snails, suggesting that the microbiota is streamlined to a narrower set of core members. Furthermore, native snails exhibit relatively low alpha diversity but high inter-individual variation, whereas invasive snails have higher alpha diversity but are relatively similar to each other. Together, our findings demonstrate that microbiota comparisons across native and invasive populations can reveal the impact of a long coevolutionary history and specialization of microbes in the native host range, as well as new associations occurring after invasion. We lay essential groundwork for understanding how microbial relationships affect invasion success and how microbes may be utilized in the control of invasive hosts.

## The Impacts of the Occupants on the Bacterial Communities of Classrooms.
 26.03.2021, _Z Feng, H Shen, Y Nie, XL Wu_


In modern societies, people spend most of their time in the built environment which harbors unique microbial assemblages with the potential to influence human health. However, how the occupants of buildings influence indoor microbial communities remains under-researched. Here, we investigated the diversities of the bacterial communities of a typical Chinese middle school to demonstrate the effects of occupant activities on bacterial communities inside classrooms. The results showed that samples taken from classrooms exhibited higher microbial diversity compared to samples collected from public areas such as gym and restaurant, suggesting the occupant activities could increase the diversities of the indoor microbial communities. Moreover, we also found that the duration of occupation strongly influence the presence/absence of phylogenetic lineages of the bacterial communities, the type of occupants, on the other hand, affect the relative abundances of bacterial taxa. In addition, samples taken from classrooms with longer occupation time exhibited a better fit to the Sloan Neutral Community Model for Prokaryotes, suggesting that room occupation influences the assembly process of microbial communities. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the duration of occupation and the type of occupants influence the microbiome of the built environment.

## Meta-analysis methods for multiple related markers: Applications to microbiome studies with the results on multiple α-diversity indices.
 26.03.2021, _H Koh, S Tuddenham, CL Sears, N Zhao_


Meta-analysis is a practical and powerful analytic tool that enables a unified statistical inference across the results from multiple studies. Notably, researchers often report the results on multiple related markers in each study (eg, various α-diversity indices in microbiome studies). However, univariate meta-analyses are limited to combining the results on a single common marker at a time, whereas existing multivariate meta-analyses are limited to the situations where marker-by-marker correlations are given in each study. Thus, here we introduce two meta-analysis methods, multi-marker meta-analysis (mMeta) and adaptive multi-marker meta-analysis (aMeta), to combine multiple studies throughout multiple related markers with no priori results on marker-by-marker correlations. mMeta is a statistical estimator for a pooled estimate and its SE across all the studies and markers, whereas aMeta is a statistical test based on the test statistic of the minimum P-value among marker-specific meta-analyses. mMeta conducts both effect estimation and hypothesis testing based on a weighted average of marker-specific pooled estimates while estimating marker-by-marker correlations non-parametrically via permutations, yet its power is only moderate. In contrast, aMeta closely approaches the highest power among marker-specific meta-analyses, yet it is limited to hypothesis testing. While their applications can be broader, we illustrate the use of mMeta and aMeta to combine microbiome studies throughout multiple α-diversity indices. We evaluate mMeta and aMeta in silico and apply them to real microbiome studies on the disparity in α-diversity by the status of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The R package for mMeta and aMeta is freely available at https://github.com/hk1785/mMeta.
