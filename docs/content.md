It is estimated that around 15 million babies are born prematurely every year and approximately one million children die each year due to complications of preterm birth (PTB). Many survivors face a lifetime of disability, including learning disabilities and visual and hearing problems. The current study aimed to characterize Lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal swabs and determine their antibiotic susceptibility.

## Long-term use of antibiotics and risk of type 2 diabetes in women: a prospective cohort study.

Accumulating evidence suggested that long-term antibiotic use may alter the gut microbiome, which has, in turn, been linked to type 2 diabetes. We undertook this study to investigate whether antibiotic use was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

## The Impact of Diabetes on the Gut and Salivary IgA Microbiomes.

Mucosal surfaces like those present in the lung, gut, and mouth interface with distinct external environments. These mucosal gateways are not only portals of entry for potential pathogens but homes to microbial communities that impact host health. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is the single most abundant acquired immune component secreted into mucosal surfaces and via the process of immune exclusion, shapes the architecture of these microbiomes. Not all microorganisms at mucosal surfaces are targeted by SIgA, therefore a better understanding of the SIgA-coated fraction may identify the microbial constituents that stimulate host immune responses in the context of health and disease. Chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes are associated with altered microbial communities (dysbiosis) that in turn affect immune-mediated homeostasis. 16S rDNA sequencing of SIgA-coated/uncoated bacteria (IgA-Biome) was conducted on stool and saliva samples of normoglycemic participants and individuals with prediabetes or diabetes (n=8/group). These analyses demonstrated shifts in relative abundance in the IgA-Biome profiles between normoglycemic, prediabetic, or diabetic samples distinct from that of the overall microbiome. Differences in IgA-Biome alpha diversity were apparent for both stool and saliva, while overarching bacterial community differences (beta diversity) were also observed in saliva. These data suggest that IgA-Biome analyses can be used to identify novel microbial signatures associated with diabetes and support the need for further studies exploring these communities. Ultimately, an understanding of the IgA-Biome may promote development of novel strategies to restructure the microbiome as a means of preventing or treating diseases associated with dysbiosis at mucosal surfaces.
