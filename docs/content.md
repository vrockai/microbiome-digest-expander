Studies have suggested that the vaginal microbiome and gut microbiome are involved in pregnancy-related diseases, but little exploration of the link with early miscarriage or threatened miscarriage (TM) has been done. Whether the characteristics of the vaginal microbiome and gut microbiome in early pregnancy are related to TM and early pregnancy outcomes remains unclear.

The early life gut microbiome is crucial in maintaining host metabolic and immune homeostasis. Though neonates with critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) are at substantial risks of malnutrition and immune imbalance, the microbial links to CCHD pathophysiology remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the gut microbiome in neonates with CCHD in association with metabolomic traits. Moreover, we explored the clinical implications of the host-microbe interactions in CCHD.

The human gut microbiome has been extensively explored, while the archaeal viruses remain largely unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the archaeal viruses from the human gut metagenomes and the existing virus collections using the CRISPR spacer and viral signature-based approach. This results in 1279 viral species, of which, 95.2% infect Methanobrevibacteria_A, 56.5% shared high identity (&gt;95%) with the archaeal proviruses, 37.2% have a host range across archaeal species, and 55.7% are highly prevalent in the human population (&gt;1%). A methanogenic archaeal virus-specific gene for pseudomurein endoisopeptidase (PeiW) frequently occurs in the viral sequences (n = 150). Analysis of 33 Caudoviricetes viruses with a complete genome often discovers the genes (integrase, n = 29; mazE, n = 10) regulating the viral lysogenic-lytic cycle, implying the dominance of temperate viruses in the archaeal virome. Together, our work uncovers the unexplored diversity of archaeal viruses, revealing the novel facet of the human gut microbiome.

## Fecal level of butyric acid, a microbiome-derived metabolite, is increased in patients with severe carotid atherosclerosis.

The short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyric acid maintains a healthy gut barrier and vascular endothelium. We aimed to investigate the association between fecal butyric acid, carotid atherosclerosis and risk factors for ischemic stroke. Patients with severe carotid atherosclerosis (i.e. ≥ 50% stenosis) (n = 43) were compared with healthy controls (n = 38). We analyzed fecal SCFAs by gas chromatography, microbiota composition by 16S rRNA sequencing, markers of gut barrier damage and inflammasome activation by immunoassay, and plasma SCFAs by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. Patients had higher fecal butyric acid level (p = 0.024), along with increased functional potential of microbial butyric acid production (p = 0.031), compared with controls. Dietary fiber intake was comparable. Patients had higher levels of gut barrier damage markers CCL25 and IFABP, and the inflammasome activation marker IL-18, whereas plasma level of butyric was similar. Increased fecal butyric acid was associated with higher BMI, waist-hip ratio, HbA1c, CRP and leukocyte count. Contrary to our hypothesis, patients with severe carotid atherosclerosis had higher fecal butyric acid level, and increased microbial production, compared with controls. Gut barrier damage in patients might indicate decreased absorption of butyric acid and hence contribute to the higher fecal level.

## Temporary establishment of bacteria from indoor plant leaves and soil on human skin.

Plants are found in a large percentage of indoor environments, yet the potential for bacteria associated with indoor plant leaves and soil to colonize human skin remains unclear. We report results of experiments in a controlled climate chamber to characterize bacterial communities inhabiting the substrates and leaves of five indoor plant species, and quantify microbial transfer dynamics and residence times on human skin following simulated touch contact events. Controlled bacterial propagule transfer events with soil and leaf donors were applied to the arms of human occupants and repeatedly measured over a 24-h period using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.

## Stochastic variational variable selection for high-dimensional microbiome data.

The rapid and accurate identification of a minimal-size core set of representative microbial species plays an important role in the clustering of microbial community data and interpretation of clustering results. However, the huge dimensionality of microbial metagenomics datasets is a major challenge for the existing methods such as Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) models. In the approach of the existing methods, the computational burden of identifying a small number of representative species from a large number of observed species remains a challenge.
