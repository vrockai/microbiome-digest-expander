Transcriptional recording by CRISPR spacer acquisition from RNA endows engineered Escherichia coli with synthetic memory, which through Record-seq reveals transcriptome-scale records. Microbial sentinels that traverse the gastrointestinal tract capture a wide range of genes and pathways that describe interactions with the host, including quantitative shifts in the molecular environment that result from alterations in the host diet, induced inflammation, and microbiome complexity. We demonstrate multiplexed recording using barcoded CRISPR arrays, enabling the reconstruction of transcriptional histories of isogenic bacterial strains in vivo. Record-seq therefore provides a scalable, noninvasive platform for interrogating intestinal and microbial physiology throughout the length of the intestine without manipulations to host physiology and can determine how single microbial genetic differences alter the way in which the microbe adapts to the host intestinal environment.

Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with complex microbe-host interactions, involving changes in microbial communities, and gut barrier defects, leading to the translocation of microorganisms to surrounding adipose tissue (AT). We evaluated the presence of beige AT depots in CD and questioned whether succinate and/or bacterial translocation promotes white-to-beige transition in adipocytes.

Nlrp6 is a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) that forms atypical inflammasomes. Nlrp6 modulates the gut epithelium interaction with the microbiota. However, the expression and function of Nlrp6 in the kidney, a sterile environment, have not been characterized. We explored the role of Nlrp6 in acute kidney injury (AKI).

## Rapid evolution and strain turnover in the infant gut microbiome.
 11.05.2022, _DW Chen, NR Garud_


While the ecological dynamics of the infant gut microbiome have been intensely studied, relatively little is known about evolutionary dynamics in the infant gut microbiome. Here we analyze longitudinal fecal metagenomic data from &gt;700 infants and their mothers over the first year of life and find that the evolutionary dynamics in infant gut microbiomes are distinct from that of adults. We find evidence for more than 10-fold increase in the rate of evolution and strain turnover in the infant gut compared to healthy adults, with the mother-infant transition at delivery being a particularly dynamic period in which gene loss dominates. Within a few months after birth, these dynamics stabilize, and gene gains become increasingly frequent as the microbiome matures. We furthermore find that evolutionary changes in infants show signatures of being seeded by a mixture of de novo mutations and transmissions of pre-evolved lineages from the broader family. Several of these evolutionary changes occur in parallel across infants, highlighting candidate genes that may play important roles in the development of the infant gut microbiome. Our results point to a picture of a volatile infant gut microbiome characterized by rapid evolutionary and ecological change in the early days of life.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with airway inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. The relationship between the airway microbiome and bronchial gene expression in COPD is poorly understood. We aimed to identify differences in the airway microbiome from bronchial brushings in patients with COPD and healthy individuals and to investigate whether any distinguishing bacteria are related to bronchial gene expression.

## Therapeutic Targeting of the Respiratory Microbiome.

The last decade of research has revolutionized our understanding of respiratory microbiology, revealing that the lungs and airways contain diverse and dynamic microbial communities in health and disease. This "respiratory ecosystem"-a densely interconnected environment of microbial and host interactions-represents a tremendous and under-appreciated source of biological and clinical heterogeneity across patients with acute and chronic lung disease. Unlike other major sources of heterogeneity, such as comorbidities and host genetics, the respiratory microbiome is readily modifiable by clinical interventions, and therefore represents an untapped opportunity for therapeutic manipulation. As a potential "treatable trait" in efforts to subphenotype patients and deliver precision medicine, the respiratory microbiome is a promising therapeutic target. In this Pulmonary Perspective, we identify and discuss multiple challenges, both conceptual and practical, that must be overcome before the respiratory microbiome can be effectively modulated as a therapeutic target. Barriers include: 1) the need to identify specific microbiologic and ecologic "targets" for therapeutic modulation; 2) the need for an improved understanding of the efficacy and persistence of response to respiratory microbiome-modulating interventions; 3) the need for clinicians to be able to access, understand and utilize microbiome data for sub-phenotyping patients, and 4) specific concerns in special populations (including children, patients with chronic lung disease, and critically ill patients). By delineating these barriers, we identify opportunities for prospective research to advance our understanding of the respiratory microbiome, its role in human respiratory disease, and its genuine potential as a therapeutic target.

## Temporal Dynamics of the Nasopharyngeal Microbiome and its Relationship with Childhood Asthma Exacerbation.

Despite distinct nasopharyngeal microbiome (NPM) profiles between asthmatics and healthy subjects, little is known about the NPM dynamics and its relation to childhood asthma exacerbation (AE). We investigated NPM changes by longitudinally collecting 135 flocked nasopharyngeal swabs (FNPSs) from 33 school-age asthmatic children at six time points (2 to 4-week intervals) from September to December 2017 in Hong Kong. Subjects were categorized into AE and stable asthma (AS) groups according to whether they experienced any exacerbation during follow-up. One-off FNPSs from nine nonasthmatic children were included as controls. Microbiota profiles were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. All 144 NPMs were classified into six microbiome profile groups (MPGs), each dominated by Moraxella, Corynebacterium 1, Dolosigranulum, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, or Anoxybacillus. The microbial diversity and compositions of NPM in exacerbation samples were different from both baseline samples and those from healthy controls. Moraxella and Dolosigranulum-dominated NPM exhibited high temporal stability revealed by MPG transition analysis. NPM diversity decreased whereas microbial composition remained similar over time. The relative abundances of Moraxella increased while Corynebacterium 1, Anoxybacillus, and Pseudomonas decreased longitudinally. However, these temporal patterns did not differ between AE and AS groups, suggesting that short-term dynamic patterns were not sufficient to predict AE occurrence. Asthmatic NPM underwent Moraxella expansion during AE and presented a high microbiome resilience (recovery potential) after AE resolution. Microbial pathways involved in methane, ketone bodies, and vitamin B3 metabolisms were enhanced during AE and primarily contributed by Moraxella. IMPORTANCE Evidence on the dynamic changes of NPM in asthmatic patients remains limited. Here, we present that asthmatic NPMs deviating from a healthy status still showed resilience after disturbance. Our data imply from a longitudinal perspective that Moraxella increase is closely related to AE occurrence. The finding of functional dysbiosis (imbalance) during AE offers a plausible explanation for the known association between nasopharyngeal Moraxella expansion and increased AE risk. This work serves as a basis for future long-term prospective studies leveraging multiomics approaches to elucidate the temporal association between NPM and pediatric AE.
