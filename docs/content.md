## Kin selection explains the evolution of cooperation in the gut microbiota.
 02.02.2021, _C Simonet, L McNally_


Through the secretion of "public goods" molecules, microbes cooperatively exploit their habitat. This is known as a major driver of the functioning of microbial communities, including in human disease. Understanding why microbial species cooperate is therefore crucial to achieve successful microbial community management, such as microbiome manipulation. A leading explanation is that of Hamilton's inclusive-fitness framework. A cooperator can indirectly transmit its genes by helping the reproduction of an individual carrying similar genes. Therefore, all else being equal, as relatedness among individuals increases, so should cooperation. However, the predictive power of relatedness, particularly in microbes, is surrounded by controversy. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses across the full diversity of the human gut microbiota and six forms of cooperation, we find that relatedness is predictive of the cooperative gene content evolution in gut-microbe genomes. Hence, relatedness is predictive of cooperation over broad microbial taxonomic levels that encompass variation in other life-history and ecology details. This supports the generality of Hamilton's central insights and the relevance of relatedness as a key parameter of interest to advance microbial predictive and engineering science.

## Crossing Kingdoms: How the Mycobiota and Fungal-Bacterial Interactions Impact Host Health and Disease.
 02.02.2021, _W Santus, JR Devlin, J Behnsen_


The term "microbiota" invokes images of mucosal surfaces densely populated with bacteria. These surfaces and the luminal compartments they form indeed predominantly harbor bacteria. However, research from this past decade has started to complete the picture by focusing on important but largely neglected constituents of the microbiota: fungi, viruses, and archaea. The community of commensal fungi, also called the mycobiota, interacts with commensal bacteria and the host. It is thus not surprising that changes in the mycobiota have significant impact on host health and are associated with pathological conditions like Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). In this review we will give an overview of why the mycobiota is an important research area and different mycobiota research tools. We will specifically focus on distinguishing transient and actively colonizing fungi of the oral and gut mycobiota and their role in health and disease. In addition to correlative and observational studies, we will discuss mechanistic studies on specific cross-kingdom interactions of fungi, bacteria, and the host.

## Pregnant women who develop preeclampsia have lower abundance of the butyrate-producer Coprococcus in their gut microbiota.
 02.02.2021, _F Altemani, HL Barrett, L Gomez-Arango, P Josh, H David McIntyre, LK Callaway, M Morrison, GW Tyson, M Dekker Nitert_


Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder characterized by hypertension and dysfunction of several organs, that is associated with maternal and fetal complications. The human gut microbiota is related to health and disease including hypertension. Alterations in gut microbiota composition can change the short-chain fatty acid profile released by the bacteria and contribute to hypertension and metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if the composition of the gut microbiota is altered in women who develop late-onset preeclampsia. In this study, we investigated the composition of the gut microbiota at 28 weeks gestation in women who developed late-onset (&gt;34 weeks gestation) preeclampsia (DPE) by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of fecal samples obtained from 213 pregnant women in the SPRING cohort (Study of Probiotics IN Gestational diabetes). Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the density of butyrate-producing genes. Gut microbiota composition was compared between women with and without DPE. The abundance of the butyrate-producing Coprococcus genus significantly decreased in DPE. Abundance of Coprococcus is significantly and positively correlated with the abundance of genes encoding the terminal step in bacterial butyrate formation (but and buk). Women with DPE also had significantly reduced levels of serum butyrate prior to the development of symptoms than controls. This study suggests that a reduction in the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, and Coprococcus spp. in particular, may contribute to an increased risk of developing preeclampsia in pregnant women.

## Toothbrush microbiomes feature a meeting ground for human oral and environmental microbiota.
 01.02.2021, _RA Blaustein, LM Michelitsch, AJ Glawe, H Lee, S Huttelmaier, N Hellgeth, S Ben Maamar, EM Hartmann_


While indoor microbiomes impact our health and well-being, much remains unknown about taxonomic and functional transitions that occur in human-derived microbial communities once they are transferred away from human hosts. Toothbrushes are a model to investigate the potential response of oral-derived microbiota to conditions of the built environment. Here, we characterize metagenomes of toothbrushes from 34 subjects to define the toothbrush microbiome and resistome and possible influential factors.

## The role of Saccharibacteria (TM7) in the subginival microbiome as a predictor for secondary cardiovascular events.
 02.02.2021, _S Schulz, S Reichert, J Grollmitz, L Friebe, M Kohnert, B Hofmann, HG Schaller, F Klawonn, R Shi_


The composition of the subgingival microbiota is of great importance in both oral and systemic diseases. However, a possible association of the oral microbiome and cardiovascular (CV) outcome has not yet been considered in a complex model. The primary objective of the study (DRKS-ID: DRKS00015776) was to assess differences in complex subgingival bacterial composition, depending on the CV outcome in patients undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery (CABG).

## The seasonal changes of the gut microbiome of the population living in traditional lifestyles are represented by characteristic species-level and functional-level SNP enrichment patterns.
 31.01.2021, _X Zhu, J Qin, C Tan, K Ning_


Most studies investigating human gut microbiome dynamics are conducted on humans living in an urban setting. However, few studies have researched the gut microbiome of the populations living traditional lifestyles. These understudied populations are arguably better subjects in answering human-gut microbiome evolution because of their lower exposure to antibiotics and higher dependence on natural resources. Hadza hunter-gatherers in Tanzania have exhibited high biodiversity and seasonal patterns in their gut microbiome composition at the family level, where some taxa disappear in one season and reappear later. Such seasonal changes have been profiled, but the nucleotide changes remain unexplored at the genome level. Thus, it is still elusive how microbial communities change with seasonal changes at the genome level.

## The pleiotropic effects of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides on the aging gut.
 02.02.2021, _JW Arnold, J Roach, S Fabela, E Moorfield, S Ding, E Blue, S Dagher, S Magness, R Tamayo, JM Bruno-Barcena, MA Azcarate-Peril_


Prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) have an extensively demonstrated beneficial impact on intestinal health. In this study, we determined the impact of GOS diets on hallmarks of gut aging: microbiome dysbiosis, inflammation, and intestinal barrier defects ("leaky gut"). We also evaluated if short-term GOS feeding influenced how the aging gut responded to antibiotic challenges in a mouse model of Clostridioides difficile infection. Finally, we assessed if colonic organoids could reproduce the GOS responder-non-responder phenotypes observed in vivo.

## Priming for Life: Early Life Nutrition and the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.
 02.02.2021, _A Ratsika, MC Codagnone, S O'Mahony, C Stanton, JF Cryan_


Microbes colonize the human body during the first moments of life and coexist with the host throughout the lifespan. Intestinal microbiota and their metabolites aid in the programming of important bodily systems such as the immune and the central nervous system during critical temporal windows of development, with possible structural and functional implications throughout the lifespan. These critical developmental windows perinatally (during the first 1000 days) are susceptible timepoints for insults that can endure long lasting effects on the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Environmental and parental factors like host genetics, mental health, nutrition, delivery and feeding mode, exposure to antibiotics, immune activation and microbiota composition antenatally, are all factors that are able to modulate the microbiota composition of mother and infant and may thus regulate important bodily functions. Among all these factors, early life nutrition plays a pivotal role in perinatal programming and in the modulation of offspring microbiota from birth throughout lifespan. This review aims to present current data on the impact of early life nutrition and microbiota priming of important bodily systems and all the factors influencing the microbial coexistence with the host during early life development.

## Gut Microbial Signatures in Sporadic and Hereditary Colorectal Cancer.
 02.02.2021, _G Mori, MR Pasca_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death and the third most common cancer in the world. Depending on the origin of the mutation, colorectal carcinomas are classified as sporadic or hereditary. Cancers derived from mutations appearing during life, affecting individual cells and their descendants, are called sporadic and account for almost 95% of the CRCs. Less than 5% of CRC cases result from constitutional mutations conferring a very high risk of developing cancer. Screening for hereditary-related cancers is offered to individuals at risk for hereditary CRC, who have either not undergone genetic evaluation or have uncertain genetic test results. In this review, we briefly summarize the main findings on the correlation between sporadic CRC and the gut microbiota, and we specifically focus on the few evidences about the role that gut microorganisms have on the development of CRC hereditary syndromes. The characterization of a gut microbiota associated with an increased risk of developing CRC could have a profound impact for prevention purposes. We also discuss the potential role of the gut microbiota as therapeutic treatment.

## Mechanisms underlying gut microbiota-host interactions in insects.
 29.01.2021, _K Schmidt, P Engel_


Insects are the most diverse group of animals and colonize almost all environments on our planet. This diversity is reflected in the structure and function of the microbial communities inhabiting the insect digestive system. As in mammals, the gut microbiota of insects can have important symbiotic functions, complementing host nutrition, facilitating dietary breakdown or providing protection against pathogens. There is an increasing number of insect models that are experimentally tractable, facilitating mechanistic studies of gut microbiota-host interactions. In this Review, we will summarize recent findings that have advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the symbiosis between insects and their gut microbiota. We will open the article with a general introduction to the insect gut microbiota and then turn towards the discussion of particular mechanisms and molecular processes governing the colonization of the insect gut environment as well as the diverse beneficial roles mediated by the gut microbiota. The Review highlights that, although the gut microbiota of insects is an active field of research with implications for fundamental and applied science, we are still in an early stage of understanding molecular mechanisms. However, the expanding capability to culture microbiomes and to manipulate microbe-host interactions in insects promises new molecular insights from diverse symbioses.

## Community Structure of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi in Soils of Switchgrass Harvested for Bioenergy.
 01.12.2020, _AC Dirks, RD Jackson_

Learning more about the biodiversity and composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) under alternative agricultural management scenarios may be important to the sustainable intensification of switchgrass grown as a bioenergy crop. Using PacBio single-molecule sequencing and taxonomic resolution to the level of amplicon sequence variant (ASV), we assessed the effects of nitrogen amendment on AMF associating with switchgrass and explored relationships between AMF and switchgrass yield across three sites of various productivities in Wisconsin. Nitrogen amendment had little effect on AMF diversity metrics or community composition. While AMF ASV diversity was not correlated with switchgrass yield, AMF family richness and switchgrass yield had a strong, positive relationship at one of our three sites. Each of our sites was dominated by unique ASVs of the species Paraglomus brasilianum, indicating regional segregation of AMF at the intraspecific level. Our molecular biodiversity survey identified putative core members of the switchgrass microbiome, as well as novel clades of AMF, especially in the order Paraglomerales and the genus Nanoglomus Furthermore, our phylogenies unite the cosmopolitan, soil-inhabiting clade deemed GS24 with Pervetustaceae, an enigmatic family prevalent in stressful environments. Future studies should isolate and characterize the novel genetic diversity found in switchgrass agroecosystems and explore the potential yield benefits of AMF richness.IMPORTANCE We assessed the different species of beneficial fungi living in agricultural fields of switchgrass, a large grass grown for biofuels, using high-resolution DNA sequencing. Contrary to our expectations, the fungi were not greatly affected by fertilization. However, we found a positive relationship between plant productivity and the number of families of beneficial fungi at one site. Furthermore, we sequenced many species that could not be identified with existing reference databases. One group of fungi was highlighted in an earlier study for being widely distributed but of unknown taxonomy. We discovered that this group belonged to a family called Pervetustaceae, which may benefit switchgrass in stressful environments. To produce higher-yielding switchgrass in a more sustainable manner, it could help to study these undescribed fungi and the ways in which they may contribute to greater switchgrass yield in the absence of fertilization.

## Microbial intrusion and seasonal dynamics in the groundwater microbiome of a porous basaltic rock aquifer used as municipal water reservoir.
 28.01.2021, _S Knobloch, AM Klonowski, S Tómasdóttir, BR Kristjánsson, S Guðmundsson, VÞ Marteinsson_


Groundwater is a key resource for safe drinking water supply. Yet unconfined aquifers can be vulnerable to microbial contamination during extreme weather events that lead to surface runoff. The current study characterises the groundwater microbiome of a porous basaltic rock aquifer in South-West Iceland used for drinking water extraction and analyses the microbial community dynamics during surface runoff. The groundwater microbial community sampled from twelve wells across the extraction area contained over 745 prokaryotic genera and was phylogenetically similar between wells and most seasons, representing a diverse but homogenous ecosystem. The largest seasonal variation in the microbial community composition was detected during a period of concurrent snow melt and high precipitation leading to surface runoff. This period was characterised by an increased abundance of soil-associated taxa in the groundwater microbiome and specifically of taxa assigned to Aeromonas and Bacillus. A field experiment simulating high surface runoff around a groundwater well confirmed the increased abundance of surface soil microorganisms in the well water, indicating vulnerability of groundwater towards surface microbial intrusion during extreme weather events. As such events are likely to increase due to climate change, novel water management tools such as microbial community analysis could help ensure drinking water safety.

## Bacterial Diversity and Community Composition Distribution in Cold-Desert Habitats of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China.
 01.02.2021, _W Zhang, A Bahadur, W Sajjad, G Zhang, F Nasir, B Zhang, X Wu, G Liu, T Chen_


Bacterial communities in cold-desert habitats play an important ecological role. However, the variation in bacterial diversity and community composition of the cold-desert ecosystem in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau remains unknown. To fill this scientific gape, Illumina MiSeq sequencing was performed on 15 soil samples collected from different cold-desert habitats, including human-disturbed, vegetation coverage, desert land, and sand dune. The abundance-based coverage estimator, Shannon, and Chao indices showed that the bacterial diversity and abundance of the cold-desert were high. A significant variation reported in the bacterial diversity and community composition across the study area. Proteobacteria accounted for the largest proportion (12.4-55.7%) of all sequences, followed by Actinobacteria (9.2-39.7%), Bacteroidetes (1.8-21.5%), and Chloroflexi (2.7-12.6%). Furthermore, unclassified genera dominated in human-disturbed habitats. The community profiles of GeErMu, HongLiangHe, and CuoNaHu sites were different and metagenomic biomarkers were higher (22) in CuoNaHu sites. Among the soil physicochemical variables, the total nitrogen and electric conductivity significantly influenced the bacterial community structure. In conclusion, this study provides information regarding variation in diversity and composition of bacterial communities and elucidates the association between bacterial community structures and soil physicochemical variables in cold-desert habitats of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
