## Immune System, Microbiota, and Microbial Metabolites: The Unresolved Triad in Colorectal Cancer Microenvironment.
 13.04.2021, _M Hanus, D Parada-Venegas, G Landskron, AM Wielandt, C Hurtado, K Alvarez, MA Hermoso, F López-Köstner, M De la Fuente_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. As with other cancers, CRC is a multifactorial disease due to the combined effect of genetic and environmental factors. Most cases are sporadic, but a small proportion is hereditary, estimated at around 5-10%. In both, the tumor interacts with heterogeneous cell populations, such as endothelial, stromal, and immune cells, secreting different signals (cytokines, chemokines or growth factors) to generate a favorable tumor microenvironment for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. There is ample evidence that inflammatory processes have a role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression in CCR. Different profiles of cell activation of the tumor microenvironment can promote pro or anti-tumor pathways; hence they are studied as a key target for the control of cancer progression. Additionally, the intestinal mucosa is in close contact with a microorganism community, including bacteria, bacteriophages, viruses, archaea, and fungi composing the gut microbiota. Aberrant composition of this microbiota, together with alteration in the diet-derived microbial metabolites content (such as butyrate and polyamines) and environmental compounds has been related to CRC. Some bacteria, such as pks+ Escherichia coli or Fusobacterium nucleatum, are involved in colorectal carcinogenesis through different pathomechanisms including the induction of genetic mutations in epithelial cells and modulation of tumor microenvironment. Epithelial and immune cells from intestinal mucosa have Pattern-recognition receptors and G-protein coupled receptors (receptor of butyrate), suggesting that their activation can be regulated by intestinal microbiota and metabolites. In this review, we discuss how dynamics in the gut microbiota, their metabolites, and tumor microenvironment interplays in sporadic and hereditary CRC, modulating tumor progression.

## Microbiome and colorectal cancer: A review of the past, present, and future.
 13.04.2021, _MS Johns, NJ Petrelli_


The gastrointestinal tract is home to diverse and abundant microorganisms, collectively referred to as the microbiome. This ecosystem typically contains trillions of microbial cells that play an important role in regulation of human health. The microbiome has been implicated in host immunity, nutrient absorption, digestion, and metabolism. In recent years, researchers have shown that alteration of the microbiome is associated with disease development, such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. This review discusses the five decades of research into the human microbiome and the development of colorectal cancer - the historical context including experiments that sparked interest, the explosion of research that has occurred in the last decade, and finally the future of testing and treatment.

## Microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids modulate microglia and promote Aβ plaque deposition.
 13.04.2021, _AV Colombo, RK Sadler, G Llovera, V Singh, S Roth, S Heindl, L Sebastian Monasor, A Verhoeven, F Peters, S Parhizkar, F Kamp, M Gomez de Aguero, AJ MacPherson, E Winkler, J Herms, C Benakis, M Dichgans, H Steiner, M Giera, C Haass, S Tahirovic, A Liesz_


Previous studies have identified a crucial role of the gut microbiome in modifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. However, the mechanisms of microbiome-brain interaction in AD were so far unknown. Here, we identify microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFA) as microbial metabolites which promote Aβ deposition. Germ-free (GF) AD mice exhibit a substantially reduced Aβ plaque load and markedly reduced SCFA plasma concentrations; conversely, SCFA supplementation to GF AD mice increased the Aβ plaque load to levels of conventionally colonized (specific pathogen-free [SPF]) animals and SCFA supplementation to SPF mice even further exacerbated plaque load. This was accompanied by the pronounced alterations in microglial transcriptomic profile, including upregulation of ApoE. Despite increased microglial recruitment to Aβ plaques upon SCFA supplementation, microglia contained less intracellular Aβ. Taken together, our results demonstrate that microbiota-derived SCFA are critical mediators along the gut-brain axis which promote Aβ deposition likely via modulation of the microglial phenotype.

## Intestinal microbiota drives cholestasis-induced specific hepatic gene expression patterns.
 13.04.2021, _O Juanola, M Hassan, P Kumar, B Yilmaz, I Keller, C Simillion, C Engelmann, F Tacke, JF Dufour, A De Gottardi, S Moghadamrad_


Intestinal microbiota regulates multiple host metabolic and immunological processes. Consequently, any difference in its qualitative and quantitative composition is susceptible to exert significant effects, in particular along the gut-liver axis. Indeed, recent findings suggest that such changes modulate the severity and the evolution of a wide spectrum of hepatobiliary disorders. However, the mechanisms linking intestinal microbiota and the pathogenesis of liver disease remain largely unknown. In this work, we investigated how a distinct composition of the intestinal microbiota, in comparison with germ-free conditions, may lead to different outcomes in an experimental model of acute cholestasis. Acute cholestasis was induced in germ-free (GF) and altered Schaedler's flora (ASF) colonized mice by common bile duct ligation (BDL). Studies were performed 5 days after BDL and hepatic histology, gene expression, inflammation, lipids metabolism, and mitochondrial functioning were evaluated in normal and cholestatic mice. Differences in plasma concentration of bile acids (BA) were evaluated by UHPLC-HRMS. The absence of intestinal microbiota was associated with significant aggravation of hepatic bile infarcts after BDL. At baseline, we found the absence of gut microbiota induced altered expression of genes involved in the metabolism of fatty and amino acids. In contrast, acute cholestasis induced altered expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix, cell cycle, autophagy, activation of MAPK, inflammation, metabolism of lipids, and mitochondrial functioning pathways. Ductular reactions, cell proliferation, deposition of collagen 1 and autophagy were increased in the presence of microbiota after BDL whereas GF mice were more susceptible to hepatic inflammation as evidenced by increased gene expression levels of osteopontin, interleukin (IL)-1β and activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway as compared to ASF colonized mice. Additonally, we found that the presence of microbiota provided partial protection to the mitochondrial functioning and impairment in the fatty acid metabolism after BDL. The concentration of the majority of BA markedly increased after BDL in both groups without remarkable differences according to the hygiene status of the mice. In conclusion, acute cholestasis induced more severe liver injury in GF mice compared to mice with limited intestinal bacterial colonization. This protective effect was associated with different hepatic gene expression profiles mostly related to tissue repair, metabolic and immune functions. Our findings suggest that microbial-induced differences may impact the course of cholestasis and modulate liver injury, offering a background for novel therapies based on the modulation of the intestinal microbiota.

## When your host shuts down: larval diapause impacts host-microbiome interactions in Nasonia vitripennis.
 13.04.2021, _J Dittmer, RM Brucker_


The life cycles of many insect species include an obligatory or facultative diapause stage with arrested development and low metabolic activity as an overwintering strategy. Diapause is characterised by profound physiological changes in endocrine activity, cell proliferation and nutrient metabolism. However, little is known regarding host-microbiome interactions during diapause, despite the importance of bacterial symbionts for host nutrition and development. In this work, we investigated (i) the role of the microbiome for host nutrient allocation during diapause and (ii) the impact of larval diapause on microbiome dynamics in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis, a model organism for host-microbiome interactions.

## Gut microbiota-derived inosine from dietary barley leaf supplementation attenuates colitis through PPARγ signaling activation.
 09.04.2021, _D Li, Y Feng, M Tian, J Ji, X Hu, F Chen_


Ulcerative colitis is a type of chronic inflammatory bowel disease closely associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal homeostasis dysregulation. Barley leaf (BL) has a long history of use in Traditional Chinese Medicine with potential health-promoting effects on intestinal functions. However, its mechanism of action is not yet clear. Here, we explore the potential modulating roles of gut microbial metabolites of BL to protect against colitis and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.

## Important ecophysiological roles of non-dominant Actinobacteria in plant residue decomposition, especially in less fertile soils.
 11.04.2021, _Y Bao, J Dolfing, Z Guo, R Chen, M Wu, Z Li, X Lin, Y Feng_


Microbial-driven decomposition of plant residues is integral to carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. Actinobacteria, one of the most widely distributed bacterial phyla in soils, are known for their ability to degrade plant residues in vitro. However, their in situ importance and specific activity across contrasting ecological environments are not known. Here, we conducted three field experiments with buried straw in combination with microcosm experiments with 13C-straw in paddy soils under different soil fertility levels to reveal the ecophysiological roles of Actinobacteria in plant residue decomposition.

## Shotgun metagenomics reveals distinct functional diversity and metabolic capabilities between 12 000-year-old permafrost and active layers on Muot da Barba Peider (Swiss Alps).
 13.04.2021, _C Perez-Mon, W Qi, S Vikram, A Frossard, T Makhalanyane, D Cowan, B Frey_


The warming-induced thawing of permafrost promotes microbial activity, often resulting in enhanced greenhouse gas emissions. The ability of permafrost microorganisms to survive the in situ sub-zero temperatures, their energetic strategies and their metabolic versatility in using soil organic materials determine their growth and functionality upon thawing. Hence, functional characterization of the permafrost microbiome, particularly in the underexplored mid-latitudinal alpine regions, is a crucial first step in predicting its responses to the changing climate, and the consequences for soil-climate feedbacks. In this study, for the first time, the functional potential and metabolic capabilities of a temperate mountain permafrost microbiome from central Europe has been analysed using shotgun metagenomics. Permafrost and active layers from the summit of Muot da Barba Peider (MBP) [Swiss Alps, 2979 m above sea level (a.s.l.)] revealed a strikingly high functional diversity in the permafrost (north-facing soils at a depth of 160 cm). Permafrost metagenomes were enriched in stress-response genes (e.g. cold-shock genes, chaperones), as well as in genes involved in cell defence and competition (e.g. antiviral proteins, antibiotics, motility, nutrient-uptake ABC transporters), compared with active-layer metagenomes. Permafrost also showed a higher potential for the synthesis of carbohydrate-active enzymes, and an overrepresentation of genes involved in fermentation, carbon fixation, denitrification and nitrogen reduction reactions. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential capabilities of permafrost microorganisms to thrive in cold and oligotrophic conditions, and highlight their metabolic versatility in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Our study provides a first insight into the high functional gene diversity of the central European mountain permafrost microbiome. Our findings extend our understanding of the microbial ecology of permafrost and represent a baseline for future investigations comparing the functional profiles of permafrost microbial communities at different latitudes.

## Seafloor incubation experiment with deep-sea hydrothermal vent fluid reveals effect of pressure and lag time on autotrophic microbial communities.

Depressurization and sample processing delays may impact the outcome of shipboard microbial incubations of samples collected from the deep sea. To address this knowledge gap, we developed an ROV-powered incubator instrument to carry out and compare results from in situ and shipboard RNA Stable Isotope Probing (RNA-SIP) experiments to identify the key chemolithoautotrophic microbes and metabolisms in diffuse, low-temperature venting fluids from Axial Seamount. All the incubations showed microbial uptake of labeled bicarbonate primarily by thermophilic autotrophic Epsilonbacteraeota that oxidized hydrogen coupled with nitrate reduction. However, the in situ seafloor incubations showed higher abundances of transcripts annotated for aerobic processes suggesting that oxygen was lost from the hydrothermal fluid samples prior to shipboard analysis. Furthermore, transcripts for thermal stress proteins such as heat shock chaperones and proteases were significantly more abundant in the shipboard incubations suggesting that depressurization induced thermal stress in the metabolically active microbes in these incubations. Together, results indicate that while the autotrophic microbial communities in the shipboard and seafloor experiments behaved similarly, there were distinct differences that provide new insight into the activities of natural microbial assemblages under near-native conditions in the ocean.Importance: Diverse microbial communities drive biogeochemical cycles in Earth's ocean, yet studying these organisms and processes is often limited by technological capabilities, especially in the deep ocean. In this study, we used a novel marine microbial incubator instrument capable of in situ experimentation to investigate microbial primary producers at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. We carried out identical stable isotope probing experiments coupled to RNA sequencing both on the seafloor and on the ship to examine thermophilic, microbial autotrophs in venting fluids from an active submarine volcano. Our results indicate that microbial communities were significantly impacted by the effects of depressurization and sample processing delay, with shipboard microbial communities more stressed compared to seafloor incubations. Differences in metabolism were also apparent and are likely linked to the chemistry of the fluid at the beginning of the experiment. Microbial experimentation in the natural habitat provides new insights into understanding microbial activities in the ocean.
