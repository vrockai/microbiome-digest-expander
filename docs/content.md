The human microbiome is increasingly mined for diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers using machine learning (ML). However, metagenomics-specific software is scarce, and overoptimistic evaluation and limited cross-study generalization are prevailing issues. To address these, we developed SIAMCAT, a versatile R toolbox for ML-based comparative metagenomics. We demonstrate its capabilities in a meta-analysis of fecal metagenomic studies (10,803 samples). When naively transferred across studies, ML models lost accuracy and disease specificity, which could however be resolved by a novel training set augmentation strategy. This reveals some biomarkers to be disease-specific, with others shared across multiple conditions. SIAMCAT is freely available from siamcat.embl.de .

Bacillus cereus is widely distributed in the environment and is responsible for foodborne illnesses, causing diarrhea and vomiting. In this study, the prevalence of B. cereus bacteriophages in Korean fermented foods was studied using 6 reference strains, and JBP901 was further characterized. In a total of 47 samples, 19 (40.4%) contained more than one kind of B. cereus phage. Fourteen phages were purified and determined for host lysis profile. Among them, JBP901 was specific to B. cereus group strains (forming plaques in 13 of 14 isolates) and not able to lyse other tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains including Bacillus subtilis. Transmission electron microscopy analysis suggested that JBP901 is a member of the family Myoviridae. Restriction enzyme digestion pattern analysis and one-step growth study indicated a genome size of approximately 150 kbp and a burst size of 100. Furthermore, bacterial lysis studies revealed that JBP901 could be used to control the growth of B. cereus in liquid culture and in food. This is the first report to examine the prevalence of phages in fermented foods in Korea, and suggests that fermented foods are useful sources of B. cereus phage isolation; moreover, B. cereus phages could provide an additional tool to tackle problems associated with B. cereus contamination.

## Shotgun metagenomics reveals distinct functional diversity and metabolic capabilities between 12 000-year-old permafrost and active layers on Muot da Barba Peider (Swiss Alps).
 13.04.2021, _C Perez-Mon, W Qi, S Vikram, A Frossard, T Makhalanyane, D Cowan, B Frey_


The warming-induced thawing of permafrost promotes microbial activity, often resulting in enhanced greenhouse gas emissions. The ability of permafrost microorganisms to survive the in situ sub-zero temperatures, their energetic strategies and their metabolic versatility in using soil organic materials determine their growth and functionality upon thawing. Hence, functional characterization of the permafrost microbiome, particularly in the underexplored mid-latitudinal alpine regions, is a crucial first step in predicting its responses to the changing climate, and the consequences for soil-climate feedbacks. In this study, for the first time, the functional potential and metabolic capabilities of a temperate mountain permafrost microbiome from central Europe has been analysed using shotgun metagenomics. Permafrost and active layers from the summit of Muot da Barba Peider (MBP) [Swiss Alps, 2979 m above sea level (a.s.l.)] revealed a strikingly high functional diversity in the permafrost (north-facing soils at a depth of 160 cm). Permafrost metagenomes were enriched in stress-response genes (e.g. cold-shock genes, chaperones), as well as in genes involved in cell defence and competition (e.g. antiviral proteins, antibiotics, motility, nutrient-uptake ABC transporters), compared with active-layer metagenomes. Permafrost also showed a higher potential for the synthesis of carbohydrate-active enzymes, and an overrepresentation of genes involved in fermentation, carbon fixation, denitrification and nitrogen reduction reactions. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential capabilities of permafrost microorganisms to thrive in cold and oligotrophic conditions, and highlight their metabolic versatility in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Our study provides a first insight into the high functional gene diversity of the central European mountain permafrost microbiome. Our findings extend our understanding of the microbial ecology of permafrost and represent a baseline for future investigations comparing the functional profiles of permafrost microbial communities at different latitudes.
