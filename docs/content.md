## Human microbiome and homeostasis: insights into the key role of prebiotics, probiotics, and symbiotics.
 13.05.2020, _B Salehi, M Dimitrijević, A Aleksić, K Neffe-Skocińska, D Zielińska, D Kołożyn-Krajewska, J Sharifi-Rad, Z Stojanović-Radić, SM Prabu, CF Rodrigues, N Martins_


The interest in the study of the gut microbiome has grown exponentially. Indeed, its impact on health and disease has been increasingly reported, and the importance of keeping gut microbiome homeostasis clearly highlighted. However, and despite many advances, there are still some gaps, as well as the real discernment on the contribution of some species falls far short of what is needed. Anyway, it is already more than a solid fact of its importance in maintaining health and preventing disease, as well as in the treatment of some pathologies. In this sense, and given the existence of some ambiguous opinions, the present review aims to discuss the importance of gut microbiome in homeostasis maintenance, and even the role of probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics in both health promotion and disease prevention.

## Probiotics and the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: Focus on Psychiatry.
 14.05.2020, _S Mörkl, MI Butler, A Holl, JF Cyran, TG Dinan_


Probiotics are living bacteria, which when ingested in adequate amounts, confer health benefits. Gut microbes are suggested to play a role in many psychiatric disorders and could be a potential therapeutic target. Between the gut and the brain, there is a bi-directional communication pathway called the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The purpose of this review is to examine data from recent interventional studies focusing on probiotics and the gut-brain axis for the treatment of depression, anxiety and schizophrenia.
