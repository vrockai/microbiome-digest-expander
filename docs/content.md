Given the worldwide epidemic of diet-related chronic diseases, evidence-based dietary recommendations are fundamentally important for health promotion. Despite the importance of the human gut microbiota for the physiological effects of diet and chronic disease etiology, national dietary guidelines around the world are just beginning to capitalize on scientific breakthroughs in the microbiome field. In this review, we discuss contemporary nutritional recommendations from a microbiome science perspective, focusing on mechanistic evidence that established host-microbe interactions as mediators of the physiological effects of diet. We apply this knowledge to inform discussions of nutrition controversies, advance innovative dietary strategies, and propose an experimental framework that integrates the microbiome into nutrition research. The congruence of key paradigms in the nutrition and microbiome disciplines validates current recommendations in dietary guidelines, and the systematic incorporation of microbiome science into nutrition research has the potential to further improve and innovate healthy eating.

Infant microbiome assembly has been intensely studied in infants from industrialized nations, but little is known about this process in nonindustrialized populations. We deeply sequenced infant stool samples from the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania and analyzed them in a global meta-analysis. Infant microbiomes develop along lifestyle-associated trajectories, with more than 20% of genomes detected in the Hadza infant gut representing novel species. Industrialized infants-even those who are breastfed-have microbiomes characterized by a paucity of Bifidobacterium infantis and gene cassettes involved in human milk utilization. Strains within lifestyle-associated taxonomic groups are shared between mother-infant dyads, consistent with early life inheritance of lifestyle-shaped microbiomes. The population-specific differences in infant microbiome composition and function underscore the importance of studying microbiomes from people outside of wealthy, industrialized nations.

## Risk assessment with gut microbiome and metabolite markers in NAFLD development.

A growing body of evidence suggests interplay between the gut microbiota and the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the role of the gut microbiome in early detection of NAFLD is unclear. Prospective studies are necessary for identifying reliable, microbiome markers for early NAFLD. We evaluated 2487 individuals in a community-based cohort who were followed up 4.6 years after initial clinical examination and biospecimen sampling. Metagenomic and metabolomic characterizations using stool and serum samples taken at baseline were performed for 90 participants who progressed to NAFLD and 90 controls who remained NAFLD free at the follow-up visit. Cases and controls were matched for gender, age, body mass index (BMI) at baseline and follow-up, and 4-year BMI change. Machine learning models integrating baseline microbial signatures (14 features) correctly classified participants (auROCs of 0.72 to 0.80) based on their NAFLD status and liver fat accumulation at the 4-year follow up, outperforming other prognostic clinical models (auROCs of 0.58 to 0.60). We confirmed the biological relevance of the microbiome features by testing their diagnostic ability in four external NAFLD case-control cohorts examined by biopsy or magnetic resonance spectroscopy, from Asia, Europe, and the United States. Our findings raise the possibility of using gut microbiota for early clinical warning of NAFLD development.

## Impact of a 7-day homogeneous diet on interpersonal variation in human gut microbiomes and metabolomes.

Gut microbiota metabolism of dietary compounds generates a vast array of microbiome-dependent metabolites (MDMs), which are highly variable between individuals. The uremic MDMs (uMDMs) phenylacetylglutamine (PAG), p-cresol sulfate (PCS), and indoxyl sulfate (IS) accumulate during renal failure and are associated with poor outcomes. Targeted dietary interventions may reduce toxic MDM generation; however, it is unclear if inter-individual differences in diet or gut microbiome dominantly contribute to MDM variance. Here, we use a 7-day homogeneous average American diet to standardize dietary precursor availability in 21 healthy individuals. During dietary homogeneity, the coefficient of variation in PAG, PCS, and IS (primary outcome) did not decrease, nor did inter-individual variation in most identified metabolites; other microbiome metrics showed no or modest responses to the intervention. Host identity and age are dominant contributors to variability in MDMs. These results highlight the potential need to pair dietary modification with microbial therapies to control MDM profiles.

## A catalog of 48,425 nonredundant viruses from oral metagenomes expands the horizon of the human oral virome.

The human oral cavity is a hotspot of numerous, mostly unexplored, viruses that are important for maintaining oral health and microbiome homeostasis. Here, we analyzed 2,792 publicly available oral metagenomes and proposed the Oral Virus Database (OVD) comprising 48,425 nonredundant viral genomes (≥5 kbp). The OVD catalog substantially expanded the known phylogenetic diversity and host specificity of oral viruses, allowing for enhanced delineation of some underrepresented groups such as the predicted Saccharibacteria phages and jumbo viruses. Comparisons of the viral diversity and abundance of different oral cavity habitats suggested strong niche specialization of viromes within individuals. The virome variations in relation to host geography and properties were further uncovered, especially the age-dependent viral compositional signatures in saliva. Overall, the viral genome catalog describes the architecture and variability of the human oral virome, while offering new resources and insights for current and future studies.

## Phylogeny-guided microbiome OTU-specific association test (POST).

The relationship between host conditions and microbiome profiles, typically characterized by operational taxonomic units (OTUs), contains important information about the microbial role in human health. Traditional association testing frameworks are challenged by the high dimensionality and sparsity of typical microbiome profiles. Phylogenetic information is often incorporated to address these challenges with the assumption that evolutionarily similar taxa tend to behave similarly. However, this assumption may not always be valid due to the complex effects of microbes, and phylogenetic information should be incorporated in a data-supervised fashion.
