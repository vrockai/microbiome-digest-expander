## Lessons and recommendations from three decades as an NSF REU site: A call for systems-based assessment.
 28.03.2020, _AL McDevitt, MV Patel, AM Ellison_


For more than 30 years, the US National Science Foundation's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program has supported thousands of undergraduate researchers annually and provides many students with their first research experiences in field ecology or evolution. REUs embed students in scientific communities where they apprentice with experienced researchers, build networks with their peers, and help students understand research cultures and how to work within them. REUs are thought to provide formative experiences for developing researchers that differ from experiences in a college classrooms, laboratories, or field trips. REU assessments have improved through time but they are largely ungrounded in educational theory. Thus, evaluation of long-term impacts of REUs remains limited and best practices for using REUs to enhance student learning are repeatedly re-invented. We describe how one sociocultural learning framework, cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), could be used to guide data collection to characterize the effects of REU programs on participant's learning in an educationally meaningful context. CHAT embodies a systems approach to assessment that accounts for social and cultural factors that influence learning. We illustrate how CHAT has guided assessment of the Harvard Forest Summer Research Program in Ecology (HF-SRPE), one of the longest-running REU sites in the United States. Characterizing HF-SRPE using CHAT helped formalize thoughts and language for the program evaluation, reflect on potential barriers to success, identify assessment priorities, and revealed important oversights in data collection.

## Metagenome-wide association analysis identifies microbial determinants of post-antibiotic ecological recovery in the gut.

Loss of diversity in the gut microbiome can persist for extended periods after antibiotic treatment, impacting microbiome function, antimicrobial resistance and probably host health. Despite widespread antibiotic use, our understanding of the species and metabolic functions contributing to gut microbiome recovery is limited. Using data from 4 discovery cohorts in 3 continents comprising &gt;500 microbiome profiles from 117 individuals, we identified 21 bacterial species exhibiting robust association with ecological recovery post antibiotic therapy. Functional and growth-rate analysis showed that recovery is supported by enrichment in specific carbohydrate-degradation and energy-production pathways. Association rule mining on 782 microbiome profiles from the MEDUSA database enabled reconstruction of the gut microbial 'food web', identifying many recovery-associated bacteria as keystone species, with the ability to use host- and diet-derived energy sources, and support repopulation of other gut species. Experiments in a mouse model recapitulated the ability of recovery-associated bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bifidobacterium adolescentis) to promote recovery with synergistic effects, providing a boost of two orders of magnitude to microbial abundance in early time points and faster maturation of microbial diversity. The identification of specific species and metabolic functions promoting recovery opens up opportunities for rationally determining pre- and probiotic formulations offering protection from long-term consequences of frequent antibiotic usage.

## Challenges and emerging systems biology approaches to discover how the human gut microbiome impact host physiology.
 08.07.2020, _G Qian, JWK Ho_


Research in the human gut microbiome has bloomed with advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) and other high-throughput molecular profiling technologies. This has enabled the generation of multi-omics datasets which holds promises for big data-enabled knowledge acquisition in the form of understanding the normal physiological and pathological involvement of gut microbiomes. Ample evidence suggests that distinct microbial compositions in the human gut are associated with different diseases. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are often unclear. There is a need to move beyond statistical associations to discover how changes in the gut microbiota mechanistically affect host physiology and disease development. This review summarises state-of-the-art big data and systems biology approaches for mechanism discovery.

## Effects of anode materials on the performance and anode microbial community of soil microbial fuel cell.
 13.07.2020, _B Yu, L Feng, Y He, L Yang, Y Xun_


Five soil microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) with graphite felt, aluminium sheet, activated carbon fibre felt, graphite paper and carbon cloth as anodes were constructed using the petroleum hydrocarbon polluted soils as substrates. After 115 days of operation, the SMFC with graphite felt anode performed the best in both bioelectricity output and removal of target pollutants, with the bioelectricity output parameters of 345 mV for stable voltage, 24.0 mW/m2 for power density and 774 Ω for internal resistance, and the removal rates of 59.14 % for total petroleum hydrocarbon, 61.65 % for anthracene, and 55.92 % for pyrene, respectively. The conductivity of the material was the key factor affecting the electron transfer rate of the anode, which determined the electric acclimation and screening intensity of SMFC to soil microbes, leading to the growth and succession of the electricigens-dominanted anode microbial community with various abundances of phyla and genera. The surface structure of the anode material played a critical role in the internal resistance of SMFC through affecting the mass transfer of substrate and metabolites, and it might also change the abundance of microbes especially those non-electricigens on the community through different adhesion.

## Blood Bacterial Profiles Associated with HIV Infection and Immune Recovery.
 30.06.2020, _S Serrano-Villar, S Sanchez-Carrillo, A Talavera-Rodríguez, B Lelouvier, C Gutiérrez, A Vallejo, F Servant, JI Bernadino, V Estrada, N Madrid, MJ Gosalbes, O Bisbal, M de Lagarde, J Martínez-Sanz, R Ron, S Herrera, S Moreno, M Ferrer_


HIV infection impairs mucosal immunity and leads to bacterial translocation, fueling chronic inflammation and disease progression. While this is well established, questions remain about the compositional profile of the translocated bacteria, and to what extent it is influenced by ART. Using 16S rDNA targeted sequencing and shotgun proteomics, we show that HIV increases bacterial translocation from the gut to the blood. HIV increased α-diversity in the blood, which was dominated by aerobic bacteria belonging to Micrococcaceae (Actinobacteria) and Pseudomonadaceae (Proteobacteria) families, and the number of circulating bacterial proteins was also increased. Forty-eight weeks of ART attenuated this phenomenon. We found that enrichment with Lactobacillales order, and depletion of Actinobacteria class and Moraxellaceae and Corynebacteriacae families, were significantly associated with greater immune recovery and correlated with several inflammatory markers. Our findings suggest that the molecular crosstalk between the host and the translocated bacterial products could influence ART-mediated immune recovery.
