## [Health Literacy: Germany in the Digital Race to Catch Up Introduction of Technological Innovations is not Sufficient].

Recently, several acts have been passed by the German Ministry of Health to drive the digital transformation of the healthcare system. These aim at far-reaching innovations to improve care and increase the efficiency of the healthcare system. At the same time, the demands on users in dealing with digital applications and information are increasing. Digital health literacy is thus becoming particularly relevant. However, available studies show that the digital health literacy of the population in Germany is often limited. This paper explores challenges, gaps, and prospects regarding the implementation of these new digital health policies, particularly in terms of the implications for improving digital health literacy and increasing user involvement and participation by providing six major aspects that should be considered.

## Perinatal exposure to tetracycline contributes to lasting developmental effects on offspring.
 12.05.2021, _EM Hill, CD Howard, TL Bale, E Jašarević_


For more than 30 years, the tetracycline on/off system of inducible gene expression has been leveraged to study disease mechanisms across many research areas, especially that of metabolism and neuroscience. This system requires acute or chronic exposure to tetracycline derivatives, such as doxycycline, to manipulate gene expression in a temporal and tissue-specific manner, with exposure often being restricted to gestational and early developmental windows. Despite evidence showing that early life antibiotic exposure has adverse effects on gut microbiota, metabolism, physiology, immunity and behavior, little is known regarding the lasting impact of doxycycline treatment on relevant outcomes in experimental offspring.
