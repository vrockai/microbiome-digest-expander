## Lung Tissue Microbiome Is Associated With Clinical Outcomes of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
 05.11.2021, _HY Yoon, SJ Moon, JW Song_


Background: Several studies using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) reported that lung microbial communities were associated with the development and clinical outcome of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the microbial communities in IPF lung tissues are not well known. This study is aimed to investigate bacterial microbial communities in lung tissues and determine their impact on the clinical outcomes of patients with IPF. Methods: Genomic DNA extracted from lung tissues of patients with IPF (n = 20; 10 non-survivors) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 20) was amplified using fusion primers targeting the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S RNA genes with indexing barcodes. Results: Mean age of IPF subjects was 63.3 yr, and 65% were male. Alpha diversity indices did not significantly differ between IPF patients and controls, or between IPF non-survivors and survivors. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Paracoccus, and Akkermansia was increased, whereas that of Caulobacter, Azonexus, and Undibacterium decreased in patients with IPF compared with that in the controls. A decreased relative abundance of Pelomonas (odds ratio [OR], 0.352, p = 0.027) and Azonexus (OR, 0.013, p = 0.046) was associated with a diagnosis of IPF in the multivariable logistic analysis adjusted by age and gender. Multivariable Cox analysis adjusted for age and forced vital capacity (FVC) revealed that higher relative abundance of Streptococcus (hazard ratio [HR], 1.993, p = 0.044), Sphingomonas (HR, 57.590, p = 0.024), and Clostridium (HR, 37.189, p = 0.038) was independently associated with IPF mortality. The relative abundance of Curvibacter (r = 0.590) and Thioprofundum (r = 0.373) was correlated positively, whereas that of Anoxybacillus (r = -0.509) and Enterococcus (r = -0.593) was correlated inversely with FVC. In addition, the relative abundance of the Aquabacterium (r = 0.616) and Peptoniphilus (r = 0.606) genera was positively correlated, whereas that of the Fusobacterium (r = -0.464) and Phycicoccus (r = -0.495) genera was inversely correlated with distance during the 6-min walking test. Conclusions: The composition of the microbiome in lung tissues differed between patients with IPF and controls and was associated with the diagnosis, mortality, and disease severity of IPF.

## Mechanisms underlying interactions between two abundant oral commensal bacteria.
 04.11.2021, _D Perera, A McLean, V Morillo-López, K Cloutier-Leblanc, E Almeida, K Cabana, J Mark Welch, M Ramsey_


Complex polymicrobial biofilm communities are abundant in nature particularly in the human oral cavity where their composition and fitness can affect health. While the study of these communities during disease is essential and prevalent, little is known about interactions within the healthy plaque community. Here we describe interactions between two of the most abundant species in this healthy microbiome, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus mitis. We discovered that H. parainfluenzae typically exists adjacent to mitis group streptococci in vivo with which it is also positively correlated based on microbiome data. By comparing in vitro coculture data to ex vivo microscopy we revealed that this co-occurrence is density dependent and further influenced by H2O2 production. We discovered that H. parainfluenzae utilizes a more redundant, multifactorial response to H2O2 than related microorganisms and that this system's integrity enhances streptococcal fitness. Our results indicate that mitis group streptococci are likely the in vivo source of NAD for H. parainfluenzae and also evoke patterns of carbon utilization in vitro for H. parainfluenzae similar to those observed in vivo. Our findings describe mechanistic interactions between two of the most abundant and prevalent members of healthy supragingival plaque that contribute to their in vivo survival.

## Epigenetic adaptations of the masticatory mucosa to periodontal inflammation.

In mucosal barrier interfaces, flexible responses of gene expression to long-term environmental changes allow adaptation and fine-tuning for the balance of host defense and uncontrolled not-resolving inflammation. Epigenetic modifications of the chromatin confer plasticity to the genetic information and give insight into how tissues use the genetic information to adapt to environmental factors. The oral mucosa is particularly exposed to environmental stressors such as a variable microbiota. Likewise, persistent oral inflammation is the most important intrinsic risk factor for the oral inflammatory disease periodontitis and has strong potential to alter DNA-methylation patterns. The aim of the current study was to identify epigenetic changes of the oral masticatory mucosa in response to long-term inflammation that resulted in periodontitis.

## Increase of SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in faecal samples prompts for rethinking of SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 epidemiology.
 05.08.2021, _M Petrillo, C Brogna, S Cristoni, M Querci, O Piazza, G Van den Eede_


_Biology, COVID-19, Feces, Humans, RNA, Viral, SARS-CoV-2_
Background Scientific evidence for the involvement of human microbiota in the development of COVID-19 disease has been reported recently. SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in human faecal samples and SARS-CoV-2 activity in faeces from COVID-19 patients have been observed. Methods Starting from these observations, an experimental design was developed to cultivate in vitro faecal microbiota from infected individuals, to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2, and to collect data on the relationship between faecal bacteria and the virus. Results Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 replicates in vitro in bacterial growth medium, that the viral replication follows bacterial growth and it is influenced by the administration of specific antibiotics. SARS-CoV-2-related peptides have been detected in 30-day bacterial cultures and characterised. Discussion Our observations are compatible with a 'bacteriophage-like' behaviour of SARS-CoV-2, which, to our knowledge has not been observed or described before. These results are unexpected and hint towards a novel hypothesis on the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and on the COVID-19 epidemiology. The discovery of possible new modes of action of SARS-CoV-2 has far-reaching implications for the prevention and the treatment of the disease.

## Microbiota-derived acetate enables the metabolic fitness of the brain innate immune system during health and disease.
 03.11.2021, _D Erny, N Dokalis, C Mezö, A Castoldi, O Mossad, O Staszewski, M Frosch, M Villa, V Fuchs, A Mayer, J Neuber, J Sosat, S Tholen, O Schilling, A Vlachos, T Blank, M Gomez de Agüero, AJ Macpherson, EJ Pearce, M Prinz_


As tissue macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), microglia constitute the pivotal immune cells of this organ. Microglial features are strongly dependent on environmental cues such as commensal microbiota. Gut bacteria are known to continuously modulate microglia maturation and function by the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). However, the precise mechanism of this crosstalk is unknown. Here we determined that the immature phenotype of microglia from germ-free (GF) mice is epigenetically imprinted by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac on metabolic genes associated with substantial functional alterations including increased mitochondrial mass and specific respiratory chain dysfunctions. We identified acetate as the essential microbiome-derived SCFA driving microglia maturation and regulating the homeostatic metabolic state, and further showed that it is able to modulate microglial phagocytosis and disease progression during neurodegeneration. These findings indicate that acetate is an essential bacteria-derived molecule driving metabolic pathways and functions of microglia during health and perturbation.

## Phage-delivered CRISPR-Cas9 for strain-specific depletion and genomic deletions in the gut microbiome.
 03.11.2021, _KN Lam, P Spanogiannopoulos, P Soto-Perez, M Alexander, MJ Nalley, JE Bisanz, RR Nayak, AM Weakley, FB Yu, PJ Turnbaugh_


Mechanistic insights into the role of the human microbiome in the predisposition to and treatment of disease are limited by the lack of methods to precisely add or remove microbial strains or genes from complex communities. Here, we demonstrate that engineered bacteriophage M13 can be used to deliver DNA to Escherichia coli within the mouse gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Delivery of a programmable exogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system enables the strain-specific depletion of fluorescently marked isogenic strains during competitive colonization and genomic deletions that encompass the target gene in mice colonized with a single strain. Multiple mechanisms allow E. coli to escape targeting, including loss of the CRISPR array or even the entire CRISPR-Cas9 system. These results provide a robust and experimentally tractable platform for microbiome editing, a foundation for the refinement of this approach to increase targeting efficiency, and a proof of concept for the extension to other phage-bacterial pairs of interest.

Environmental factors are important with respect to the rupture of cerebral aneurysms. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome, an environmental factor, and aneurysm rupture is unclear. Therefore, we compared the gut microbiome in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) and ruptured aneurysms (RAs) to identify the specific bacteria causing the rupture of cerebral aneurysms.

## Effect of Long-Term and Short-Term Imbalanced Zn Manipulation on Gut Microbiota and Screening for Microbial Markers Sensitive to Zinc Status.
 03.11.2021, _L Chen, Z Wang, P Wang, X Yu, H Ding, Z Wang, J Feng_


Zinc (Zn) imbalance is a common single-nutrient disorder worldwide, but little is known about the short-term and long-term effects of imbalanced dietary zinc in the intestinal microbiome. Here, 3-week-old C57BL/6 mice were fed diets supplemented with Zn at the doses of 0 (low Zn), 30 (control Zn), 150 (high Zn), and 600 mg/kg of body weight (excess Zn) for 4 weeks (short term) and 8 weeks (long term). The gut bacterial composition at the phyla, genus, and species levels were changed as the result of the imbalanced Zn diet (e.g., Lactobacillus reuteri and Akkermansia muciniphila). Moreover, pathways including carbohydrate, glycan, and nucleotide metabolism were decreased by a short-term low-Zn diet. Valeriate production was suppressed by a long-term low-Zn diet. Pathways such as drug resistance and infectious diseases were upregulated in high- and excess-Zn diets over 4-week and 8-week intervals. Long-term zinc fortification doses, especially at the high-Zn level, suppressed the abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing genera as well as the concentrations of metabolites. Finally, Melainabacteria (phylum) and Desulfovibrio sp. strain ABHU2SB (species) were identified to be potential markers for Zn status with high accuracy (area under the curve [AUC], &gt;0.8). Collectively, this study identified significant changes in gut microbial composition and its metabolite concentration in altered Zn-fed mice and the relevant microbial markers for Zn status. IMPORTANCE Zn insufficiency is an essential health problem in developing countries. To prevent the occurrence of zinc deficit, zinc fortification and supplementation are widely used. However, in developed countries, the amounts of Zn consumed often exceed the tolerable upper intake limit. Our results demonstrated that dietary Zn is an essential mediator of microbial community structure and that both Zn deficiency and Zn overdose can generate a dysbiosis in the gut microbiota. Moreover, specific microbial biomarkers of Zn status were identified and correlated with serum Zn level. Our study found that a short-term low-Zn diet (0 mg/kg) and a long-term high-zinc diet (150 mg/kg) had obvious negative effects in a mouse model. Thus, these results indicate that the provision and duration of supplemental Zn should be approached with caution.

## Metagenomic and network analysis revealed wide distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in monkey gut microbiota.
 06.11.2021, _Y Yan, H Li, A Fayyaz, Y Gai_


The emergence and spread of drug-resistant microorganisms that have acquired new resistance mechanisms, leading to antibiotic resistance, continue to threaten the health of humans and animals worldwide. Non-human primates (NHPs), as close living relatives of human beings in the world, have a high degree of genetic and physiological similarity to humans. However, despite its importance, we lack a comprehensive characterization or understanding of the similarities and differences of the antibiotic resistance genes of the gut microbiome carried by non-human primates and humans. In the present study, the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes carried by the gut microbiota of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were investigated by metagenomic analysis. In total, 60 resistance types conferring resistance to 11 categories of antibiotics were identified in the gut microbiome of cynomolgus monkeys. Interestingly, the composition and abundance of ARGs carried by the gut microbiota of cynomolgus monkeys can be significantly affected by dietary changes. Moreover, we found that all ARG types carried by humans are also present in cynomolgus monkeys. The tetracycline resistance gene tet(37) is evolutionarily conserved and highly homologous. Taken together, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the diversity and richness of ARGs in the gut microbiota of cynomolgus monkeys and underlines the potentially crucial role of diet in the gut health of monkeys and humans.

## Alterations in Gut Microbiome Composition and Function in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Increased Probiotic Abundance with Daily Supplementation.
 05.11.2021, _J Phan, D Nair, S Jain, T Montagne, DV Flores, A Nguyen, S Dietsche, S Gombar, P Cotter_


Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by abdominal discomfort and irregular bowel movements and stool consistency. As such, the gut microbiome has been posited as being influential for the syndrome. However, identifying microbial features associated with IBS symptom heterogeneity is difficult without large cohorts. Our aim was to identify microbial features associated with IBS and IBS subtypes compared to healthy controls and to determine if a synbiotic supplementation intervention could decrease the proportion of those microbial features. Stool samples from 490 individuals with IBS (including all dominant subtypes) and 122 individuals without IBS were analyzed with metagenomic sequencing. One hundred thirty-four IBS subjects were followed over time while receiving daily synbiotic supplementation, the composition of which varied between participants. IBS participants had significantly lower alpha diversity, an enrichment in Gram-negative bacteria, and a reduction in pathways associated with short-chain fatty acid and vitamin synthesis. Shigella species were significantly associated with IBS, while Eubacterium rectale and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were associated with healthy controls. Random forest identified unique and overlapping microbial features associated with each IBS subtype. Longitudinal assessment of 134 IBS subjects receiving synbiotic supplements demonstrated a significant difference in microbial features and an increase in probiotic abundance across time. We identified microbial features that differentiate healthy and IBS subtypes. Synbiotic supplementation in IBS subjects did not result in alpha diversity change in the microbiome but did demonstrate changes in microbial features. Future work is needed to determine if the observed microbiome changes are associated with IBS symptom improvement. IMPORTANCE An estimated 35 million people in the United States and 11.5% of the population globally are affected by IBS. Immunity, genetics, environment, diet, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and the gut microbiome are all factors that contribute to the onset or triggers of IBS. With strong supporting evidence that the gut microbiome may influence symptoms associated with IBS, elucidating the important microbes that contribute to the symptoms and severity is important to make decisions for targeted treatment. As probiotics have become more common in treating IBS symptoms, identifying effective probiotics may help inform future studies and treatment.

## The Future Is Big-and Small: Remote Sensing Enables Cross-Scale Comparisons of Microbiome Dynamics and Ecological Consequences.
 05.11.2021, _DS Beatty, LR Aoki, OJ Graham, B Yang_


Coupling remote sensing with microbial omics-based approaches provides a promising new frontier for scientists to scale microbial interactions across space and time. These data-rich, interdisciplinary methods allow us to better understand interactions between microbial communities and their environments and, in turn, their impact on ecosystem structure and function. Here, we highlight current and novel examples of applying remote sensing, machine learning, spatial statistics, and omics data approaches to marine, aquatic, and terrestrial systems. We emphasize the importance of integrating biochemical and spatiotemporal environmental data to move toward a predictive framework of microbiome interactions and their ecosystem-level effects. Finally, we emphasize lessons learned from our collaborative research with recommendations to foster productive and interdisciplinary teamwork.

Our study provides an exhaustive comparison of the microbiome core functionalities (captured by 3,936 microbial gene abundances) between hosts with divergent genotypes for intramuscular lipid deposition. After 10 generations of divergent selection for intramuscular fat in rabbits and 4.14 phenotypic standard deviations (SD) of selection response, we applied a combination of compositional and multivariate statistical techniques to identify 122 cecum microbial genes with differential abundances between the lines (ranging from -0.75 to +0.73 SD). This work elucidates that microbial biosynthesis lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, lipoproteins, mucin components, and NADH reductases, amongst others, are influenced by the host genetic determination for lipid accretion in muscle. We also differentiated between host-genetically influenced microbial mechanisms regulating lipid deposition in body or intramuscular reservoirs, with only 28 out of 122 MGs commonly contributing to both. Importantly, the results of this study are of relevant interest for the efficient development of strategies fighting obesity.

## Engineering temporal dynamics in microbial communities.
 05.11.2021, _C Ronda, HH Wang_


Microbial communities are a key part to tackling global challenges in human health, environmental conservation, and sustainable agriculture in the coming decade. Recent advances in synthetic biology to study and modify microbial communities have led to important insights into their physiology and ecology. Understanding how targeted changes to microbial communities result in reproducible alterations of the community's intrinsic fluctuations and function is important for mechanistic reconstruction of microbiomes. Studies of synthetic microbial consortia and comparative analysis of communities in normal and disrupted states have revealed ecological principles that can be leveraged to engineer communities towards desired functions. Tools enabling temporal modulation and sensing of the community dynamics offer precise spatiotemporal control of functions, help to dissect microbial interaction networks, and improve predictions of population temporal dynamics. Here we discuss recent advances to manipulate microbiome dynamics through control of specific strain engraftment and abundance, modulation of cell-cell signaling for tuning population dynamics, infiltration of new functions in the existing community with in situ engineering, and in silico modeling of microbial consortia to predict community function and ecology.

## Microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles in interkingdom communication in the gut.
 05.11.2021, _N Díaz-Garrido, J Badia, L Baldomà_


The intestine is fundamental in controlling human health. Intestinal epithelial and immune cells are continuously exposed to millions of microbes that greatly impact on intestinal epithelial barrier and immune function. This microbial community, known as gut microbiota, is now recognized as an important partner of the human being that actively contribute to essential functions of the intestine but also of distal organs. In the gut ecosystem, bidirectional microbiota-host communication does not involve direct cell contacts. Both microbiota and host-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key players of such interkingdom crosstalk. There is now accumulating body of evidence that bacterial secreted vesicles mediate microbiota functions by transporting and delivering into host cells effector molecules that modulate host signalling pathways and cell processes. Consequently, vesicles released by the gut microbiota may have great influence on health and disease. Here we review current knowledge on microbiota EVs and specifically highlight their role in controlling host metabolism, intestinal barrier integrity and immune training.

## Multiple roles of short-chain fatty acids in Alzheimer disease.
 04.11.2021, _H Chen, L Meng, L Shen_


Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease in older adults and has a complicated etiology. Recently, the roles of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the main metabolites generated by fermentation of dietary fiber by gut microbiota, in the pathogenesis of AD have attracted considerable interest. This study analyzed the multiple roles of SCFAs in AD pathogenesis from five aspects, including: 1) epigenetic regulation; 2) modulation of neuroinflammation; 3) maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB); 4) regulation of brain metabolism; and 5) interference in amyloid protein formation. According to the currently available evidence, SCFAs, particularly butyrate, cause important biological effects that interfere with the development of AD. However, the effect of other SCFAs, such as propionate, on AD might be either beneficial or harmful to different pathways, indicating that the role of SCFAs in the pathogenesis of AD is rather complicated and warrants further investigations.

## Role of gut microbiota in functional constipation.
 05.11.2021, _S Zhang, R Wang, D Li, L Zhao, L Zhu_


Functional constipation (FC) is common, yet the etiology is not clear. Accumulating evidence suggests an association between FC and abnormal gut microbiota. The relationship between the gut microbiota and the gut transit is likely bidirectional. This review summarizes the current evidence regarding the impact of gut microbiota on the pathogenesis of FC. By modulating the colonic motility, secretion, and absorption, gut microbiota may contribute to the development of FC through microbial metabolic activities involving bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and methane. In support of the key roles of the gut microbiota in FC, treatment with probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine often result in compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiota. Further studies on the pathogenesis of FC and the therapeutic mechanism of microecological agents will provide a knowledge base for better management of FC.

## Gut Feelings: The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis on Steroids.
 03.11.2021, _SY So, TC Savidge_


The intricate connection between central and enteric nervous systems is well established with emerging evidence linking gut microbiota function as a significant new contributor to gut-brain axis signaling. Several microbial signals contribute to altered gut-brain communications, with steroids representing an important biological class that impacts central and enteric nervous system function. Neuroactive steroids contribute pathologically to neurological disorders, including dementia and depression, by modulating the activity of neuroreceptors. However, limited information is available on the influence of neuroactive steroids on the enteric nervous system and gastrointestinal function. In this review, we outline how steroids can modulate enteric nervous system function by focusing on their influence on different receptors that are present in the intestine in health and disease. We also highlight the potential role of the gut microbiota in modulating neuroactive steroid signaling along the gut-brain axis.

## Urobiome: An outlook on the metagenome of urological diseases.
 03.11.2021, _R Shoemaker, J Kim_


The urinary tract likely plays a role in the development of various urinary diseases due to the recently recognized notion that urine is not sterile. In this mini review, we summarize the current literature regarding the urinary microbiome and mycobiome and its relationship to various urinary diseases. It has been recently discovered that the healthy urinary tract contains a host of microorganisms, creating a urinary microbiome. The relative abundance and type of bacteria varies, but generally, deviations in the standard microbiome are observed in individuals with urologic diseases, such as bladder cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, urgency urinary incontinence, overactive bladder syndrome, interstitial cystitis, bladder pain syndrome, and urinary tract infections. However, whether this change is causative, or correlative has yet to be determined. In summary, the urinary tract hosts a complex microbiome. Changes in this microbiome may be indicative of urologic diseases and can be tracked to predict, prevent, and treat them in individuals. However, current analytical and sampling collection methods may present limitations to the development in the understanding of the urinary microbiome and its relationship with various urinary diseases. Further research on the differences between healthy and diseased microbiomes, the long-term effects of antibiotic treatments on the urobiome, and the effect of the urinary mycobiome on general health will be important in developing a comprehensive understanding of the urinary microbiome and its relationship to the human body.

The gut microbiome is altered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, yet how these alterations contribute to intestinal inflammation is poorly understood. Murine models have demonstrated the importance of the microbiome in colitis since colitis fails to develop in many genetically susceptible animal models when re-derived into germ-free environments. We have previously shown that Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-deficient mice (Was-/-) develop spontaneous colitis, similar to human patients with loss-of-function mutations in WAS. Furthermore, we showed that the development of colitis in Was-/- mice is Helicobacter dependent. Here, we utilized a reductionist model coupled with multi-omics approaches to study the role of host-microbe interactions in intestinal inflammation.

## Differences in the gut microbiota composition of rats fed with soybean protein and their derived peptides.
 03.11.2021, _W Li, H Li, Y Zhang, C Zhang, J Zhang, X Liu_


Current studies regarding the effect of different nitrogen sources on gut microbiota have thus far disregarded the ability of probiotics and coliforms to compete for protein. This study aimed to investigate the differences in the utilization of soybean protein (SPro) and its derived peptides (SPep) by the gut microbiota of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The SPro and SPep prepared in this study showed extensive SPro molecular weight distribution, while that of SPep was minimal, ranging between 150 and 1000 Da and primarily consisting of two to five amino acids. The cecum microflora composition of the rats was determined via 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, showing that the SPro and SPep significantly increased the abundance and uniformity of the gut microbiota after 35 days of feeding. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratios of the SPep, SPro, and casein groups were 2.49 ± 0.60, 2.98 ± 1.12, and 2.59 ± 0.74, respectively. Although the rats fed with SPro and SPep displayed similar gut microbiome structures, SPep significantly promoted Lactobacillus and Phascolarctobacterium growth. The results showed that SPep significantly increased the diversity of the gut microbiota and elevated the probiotic proportion. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: SPro and SPep are two nutritious and high-quality nitrogen sources. The results showed that SPro and SPep regulated the structure of gut microbiota in rats, and the effect of SPep was better. This study provides a theoretical basis for developing SPep functional foods able to regulate gut microbiota and maintain health.

## Unraveling differences in fecal microbiota stability in mammals: from high variable carnivores and consistently stable herbivores.
 05.11.2021, _F Zoelzer, AL Burger, PW Dierkes_


Through the rapid development in DNA sequencing methods and tools, microbiome studies on a various number of species were performed during the last decade. This advance makes it possible to analyze hundreds of samples from different species at the same time in order to obtain a general overview of the microbiota. However, there is still uncertainty on the variability of the microbiota of different animal orders and on whether certain bacteria within a species are subject to greater fluctuations than others. This is largely due to the fact that the analysis in most extensive comparative studies is based on only a few samples per species or per study site. In our study, we aim to close this knowledge gap by analyzing multiple individual samples per species including two carnivore suborders Canoidea and Feloidea as well as the orders of herbivore Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla held in different zoos. To assess microbial diversity, 621 fecal samples from 31 species were characterized by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina MiSeq.

## The Role Transition of Dietary Species Richness in Modulating the Gut Microbial Assembly and Postweaning Performance of a Generalist Herbivore.
 05.11.2021, _G Li, C Shi, Y Song, H Chu, Z Zhang_


When facing a food shortage, generalist herbivores can respond by expanding their dietary species richness (DSR) to maximize energy collection, regardless of whether forages are preferred or not. Higher DSR usually indicates higher nutrient adequacy and better health. However, the high-DSR diet containing a large proportion of preferred species or a large proportion of less-preferred species means different things to an animal. It is still unknown how different shift patterns in DSR would affect distinctly the performance of animals via altering gut microbiota. We examined the gut microbial composition, diversity, community assembly processes, and performance of a generalist herbivore, Lasiopodomys brandtii, in a feeding experiment with increased levels of simulated DSR shifting from preferred plant species to less preferred ones. We found the survival rate and body growth of Brandt's voles showed a dome-shaped association with DSR: species performance increased initially with the increase of preferred plant species but declined with the increase of less-preferred food items. Several microbial taxa and functions closely related to the metabolism of amino acids and short-chain fatty acids also showed a dome-shaped association with DSR, which is consistent with the observation of performance change. However, the alpha diversities of gut microbiota increased linearly with DSR. The null model and phylogenetic analysis suggested that stochastic processes dominate at low DSR diets, whereas deterministic processes prevail at high DSR diets. These results suggest that the role of DSR in regulating animal performance by gut microbiota depends on the number of preferred forage items. IMPORTANCE The plant species diversity varies greatly under the influence of both climate change and human disturbance, which may negatively affect the productivity as well as the variability of organisms (e.g., small herbivores) at the next trophic level. It is still unknown how gut microbiota of small herbivores respond to such changes in dietary species richness. Our manipulative food experiment revealed that dietary species richness can affect the composition, functions, and community assembly of gut microbiota of Brandt's vole in a nonlinear way. Given the fast-growing interest in therapeutic diets to treat dysbiosis and to improve health conditions, our study highlights the need to consider not just the variety of consumed food but also the principles of rational nutrition.

## Strain-level analysis reveals the vertical microbial transmission during the life cycle of bumblebee.
 07.11.2021, _Q Su, Q Wang, X Mu, H Chen, Y Meng, X Zhang, L Zheng, X Hu, Y Zhai, H Zheng_


Microbial acquisition and development of the gut microbiota impact the establishment of a healthy host-microbes symbiosis. Compared with other animals, the eusocial bumblebees and honeybees possess a simple, recurring, and similar set of gut microbiota. However, all bee gut phylotypes have high strain-level diversity. Gut communities of different bee species are composed of host-specific groups of strains. The variable genomic regions among strains of the same species often confer critical functional differences, such as carbon source utilization, essential for the natural selection of specific strains. The annual bumblebee colony founded by solitary queens enables tracking the transmission routes of gut bacteria during development stages.

## Social convergence of gut microbiomes in vampire bats.
 06.11.2021, _K Yarlagadda, I Razik, RS Malhi, GG Carter_


The 'social microbiome' can fundamentally shape the costs and benefits of group-living, but understanding social transmission of microbes in free-living animals is challenging due to confounding effects of kinship and shared environments (e.g. highly associated individuals often share the same spaces, food and water). Here, we report evidence for convergence towards a social microbiome among introduced common vampire bats, Desmodus rotundus, a highly social species in which adults feed only on blood, and engage in both mouth-to-body allogrooming and mouth-to-mouth regurgitated food sharing. Shotgun sequencing of samples from six zoos in the USA, 15 wild-caught bats from a colony in Belize and 31 bats from three colonies in Panama showed that faecal microbiomes were more similar within colonies than between colonies. To assess microbial transmission, we created an experimentally merged group of the Panama bats from the three distant sites by housing these bats together for four months. In this merged colony, we found evidence that dyadic gut microbiome similarity increased with both clustering and oral contact, leading to microbiome convergence among introduced bats. Our findings demonstrate that social interactions shape microbiome similarity even when controlling for past social history, kinship, environment and diet.

## Naturally occurring fire coral clones demonstrate a genetic and environmental basis of microbiome composition.
 05.11.2021, _CE Dubé, M Ziegler, A Mercière, E Boissin, S Planes, CA Bourmaud, CR Voolstra_


Coral microbiomes are critical to holobiont functioning, but much remains to be understood about how prevailing environment and host genotype affect microbial communities in ecosystems. Resembling human identical twin studies, we examined bacterial community differences of naturally occurring fire coral clones within and between contrasting reef habitats to assess the relative contribution of host genotype and environment to microbiome structure. Bacterial community composition of coral clones differed between reef habitats, highlighting the contribution of the environment. Similarly, but to a lesser extent, microbiomes varied across different genotypes in identical habitats, denoting the influence of host genotype. Predictions of genomic function based on taxonomic profiles suggest that environmentally determined taxa supported a functional restructuring of the microbial metabolic network. In contrast, bacteria determined by host genotype seemed to be functionally redundant. Our study suggests microbiome flexibility as a mechanism of environmental adaptation with association of different bacterial taxa partially dependent on host genotype.

## Evaluation of the effect of antibiotics on gut microbiota in early life based on culturomics, SMRT sequencing and metagenomics sequencing methods.
 02.11.2021, _L Wang, J Zhang, M Zhou, Q Chen, X Yang, Y Hou, M Huang, C Man, Y Jiang_


Symbiotic gut microbiota in early life plays a vital role in human health, and changes in its communication and function are associated with various complex disorders. In this study, we analyzed the gut flora communication of 6 infants at 4 months of age and determined the disturbances related to antibiotic treatment. By the culturomics and Single Molecule Real-time sequencing methods, a total of 6234 strains were divided into 16 genera and 45 species. The alpha diversity of culturable microorganisms in amoxicillin-treated infants was significantly less than that in healthy infants (p &lt;0.05), as indicated by Chao 1, observed species and Faith's PD index. According to metagenomics, the dominant genus and species were Bifidobacterium and B. longum in the healthy group. After treatment with amoxicillin, the dominant genus and species shifted to Enterococcus and E. faecium. Based on the functional annotation of metagenomics, amoxicillin affected the metabolic function of the gut microbiome by activating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and inhibiting amino acid metabolism. Besides, the intake of antibiotics in early life increased the risk of neurodegenerative disease, virus infectious disease and antimicrobial resistance. The Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database annotation result indicated that the abundance of drug-resistance genes in the antibiotic group was higher than that in the healthy group. These genes were associated with resistance to bacitracin, most of which were associated with K. pneumonia. These findings can provide guidance in the clinic on the proper usage of antibiotics.
