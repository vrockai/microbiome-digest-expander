## Human gut microbiome aging clocks based on taxonomic and functional signatures through multi-view learning.
 18.01.2022, _Y Chen, H Wang, W Lu, T Wu, W Yuan, J Zhu, YK Lee, J Zhao, H Zhang, W Chen_


The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that is closely related to the aging process. However, there is currently no reliable method to make full use of the metagenomics data of the gut microbiome to determine the age of the host. In this study, we considered the influence of geographical factors on the gut microbiome, and a total of 2604 filtered metagenomics data from the gut microbiome were used to construct an age prediction model. Then, we developed an ensemble model with multiple heterogeneous algorithms and combined species and pathway profiles for multi-view learning. By integrating gut microbiome metagenomics data and adjusting host confounding factors, the model showed high accuracy (R2 = 0.599, mean absolute error = 8.33 years). Besides, we further interpreted the model and identify potential biomarkers for the aging process. Among these identified biomarkers, we found that Finegoldia magna, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Clostridium clostridioforme had increased abundance in the elderly. Moreover, the utilization of amino acids by the gut microbiome undergoes substantial changes with increasing age which have been reported as the risk factors for age-associated malnutrition and inflammation. This model will be helpful for the comprehensive utilization of multiple omics data, and will allow greater understanding of the interaction between microorganisms and age to realize the targeted intervention of aging.

## Comparative analysis of gut microbial composition and potential functions in captive forest and alpine musk deer.
 17.01.2022, _F Jiang, P Song, H Wang, J Zhang, D Liu, Z Cai, H Gao, X Chi, T Zhang_


Gut microbiota forms a unique microecosystem and performs various irreplaceable metabolic functions for ruminants. The gut microbiota is important for host health and provides new insight into endangered species conservation. Forest musk deer (FMD) and alpine musk deer (AMD) are typical small ruminants, globally endangered due to excessive hunting and habitat loss. Although nearly 60 years of captive musk deer breeding has reduced the hunting pressure in the wild, fatal gastrointestinal diseases restrict the growth of captive populations. In this study, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing revealed the differences in gut microbiota between FMD and AMD based on 166 fecal samples. The alpha diversity was higher in FMD than in AMD, probably helping FMD adapt to different and wider habitats. The ß-diversity was higher between adult FMD and AMD than juveniles and in winter than late spring. The phylum Firmicutes and the genera Christensenellaceae R7 group, Ruminococcus, Prevotellaceae UCG-004, and Monoglobus were significantly higher in abundance in FMD than in AMD. However, the phylum Bacteroidetes and genera Bacteroides, UCG-005, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, and Alistipes were significantly higher in AMD than FMD. The expression of metabolic functions was higher in AMD than in FMD, a beneficial pattern for AMD to maintain higher energy and substance metabolism. Captive AMD may be at higher risk of intestinal diseases than FMD, with higher relative abundances of most opportunistic pathogens and the expression of disease-related functions. These results provide valuable data for breeding healthy captive musk deer and assessing their adaptability in the wild. KEY POINTS: • Alpha diversity of gut microbiota was higher in FMD than that in AMD • Expression of metabolic and disease-related functions was higher in AMD than in FMD.

## Effects of dietary antimicrobial peptides on intestinal morphology, antioxidant status, immune responses, microbiota and pathogen disease resistance in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idellus.
 15.01.2022, _S Liu, S Wang, X Liu, L Wen, J Zou_


This study aims to highlight the effects (8 weeks) of dietary antimicrobial peptides (AMPs, a compound of 6kDa and 5kDa from intestine) on intestinal morphological functions and health status in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). Fish were supplemented with various gradient concentrations of AMPs, including M0 (0 mg/kg), M1 (100 mg/kg), M2 (200 mg/kg), M3 (400 mg/kg), M4 (800 mg/kg) and M5 (1600 mg/kg). Our results showed that amylase, lipase, chymotrypsin enzymatic levels, and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05), while malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly decreased in the intestines of the AMP treated groups compared to the M0. Histological analysis revealed villus height and crypt depth of foregut and midgut in the M4 group were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the M0. In the M3 group, the gene expression levels of IL-1β were significantly up-regulated, while levels of IL10 and TGF-β were significantly down-regulated than other treated and control groups. The abundance of Firmicutes was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05), while the Planctomycetes abundance was decreased at phylum level in M1-M5 groups. Subsequent to the AMP treatment, fish were injected with Aeromonas. hydrophila to assess disease resistant potential. In A. hydrophila injected M3-group, the gene expressions of IL-1β, IL8, and TNF-α were significantly down-regulated while that of TGF-β was significantly up-regulated, and IL10 showed no significant difference compared to the control. Further, AMPs also increased the abundance of the Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Patescibacteria, and decreased the abundance of the Fusobacteria and Firmicutes. Therefore, dietary AMPs (400-800 mg/kg) boosted intestinal health by promoting intestinal morphology, digestive and antioxidant capacities, immunity, and intestinal microbiota in C. idellus.

## Association of human disturbance and gastrointestinal parasite infection of yellow baboons in western Tanzania.
 15.01.2022, _B Mason, AK Piel, D Modrý, KJ Petrželková, FA Stewart, B Pafčo_


Human disturbance is an ongoing threat to many wildlife species, manifesting as habitat destruction, resource overuse, or increased disease exposure, among others. With increasing human: non-human primate (NHP) encounters, NHPs are increasingly susceptible to human-introduced diseases, including those with parasitic origins. As such, epidemiology of parasitic disease is becoming an important consideration for NHP conservation strategies. To investigate the relationship between parasite infections and human disturbance we studied yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) living outside of national park boundaries in western Tanzania, collecting 135 fresh faecal samples from nine troops occupying areas with varying levels of human disturbance. We fixed all samples in 10% formalin and later evaluated parasite prevalence and abundance (of isotrichid ciliates and Strongylida). We identified seven protozoan and four helminth taxa. Taxa showed varied relationships with human disturbance, baboon troop size and host age. In four taxa, we found a positive association between prevalence and troop size. We also report a trend towards higher parasite prevalence of two taxa in less disturbed areas. To the contrary, high levels of human disturbance predicted increased abundance of isotrichid ciliates, although no relationship was found between disturbance and Strongylida abundance. Our results provide mixed evidence that human disturbance is associated with NHP parasite infections, highlighting the need to consider monitoring parasite infections when developing NHP conservation strategies.

## Bacterial recognition by PGRP-SA and downstream signalling by Toll/DIF sustain commensal gut bacteria in Drosophila.
 10.01.2022, _S Bahuguna, M Atilano, M Glittenberg, D Lee, S Arora, L Wang, J Zhou, S Redhai, M Boutros, P Ligoxygakis_


The gut sets the immune and metabolic parameters for the survival of commensal bacteria. We report that in Drosophila, deficiency in bacterial recognition upstream of Toll/NF-κB signalling resulted in reduced density and diversity of gut bacteria. Translational regulation factor 4E-BP, a transcriptional target of Toll/NF-κB, mediated this host-bacteriome interaction. In healthy flies, Toll activated 4E-BP, which enabled fat catabolism, which resulted in sustaining of the bacteriome. The presence of gut bacteria kept Toll signalling activity thus ensuring the feedback loop of their own preservation. When Toll activity was absent, TOR-mediated suppression of 4E-BP made fat resources inaccessible and this correlated with loss of intestinal bacterial density. This could be overcome by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of TOR, which restored bacterial density. Our results give insights into how an animal integrates immune sensing and metabolism to maintain indigenous bacteria in a healthy gut.

## Vertical stratification of microbial communities and isotope geochemistry tie groundwater denitrification to sampling location within a nitrate-contaminated aquifer.
 17.01.2022, _A Chakraborty, M Suchy, CRJ Hubert, MC Ryan_


Nitrate pollution is a major threat to groundwater quality in agricultural areas. Natural attenuation of nitrate in contaminated aquifers is mediated by denitrifying microbial populations in anoxic environments. Vertical distribution of denitrifying microbial communities in aquifers is greatly influenced by groundwater redox conditions, local hydrogeological parameters, and seasonal variability in groundwater flow and recharge. In this study, we investigated groundwater geochemistry and the composition of bacterial and archaeal communities with increasing depth in a shallow nitrate-contaminated aquifer in British Columbia, Canada. High-resolution passive diffusion sampling was conducted to collect groundwater at 10-cm intervals from 4 to 20 m below ground surface (mbgs) in the aquifer. Geochemical analyses of major ions indicated a general shift in the groundwater chemistry below 16 mbgs including decreasing chloride concentrations that suggest two-end member mixing of shallow and deep groundwater with different chemistries. A redoxcline was further observed within a 2 m transition zone at 18-20 mbgs characterized by sharp declines in nitrate concentrations and increases in sulfate and total inorganic carbon. Excursions in δ15N-NO3- and δ18O-NO3- in the same depth interval are consistent with denitrification, and a concomitant decrease in δ34S-SO42- suggested that denitrification was coupled to sulfide or sulfur oxidation. Microbial communities within this depth interval were significantly dissimilar to those above and below, featuring putative lithotrophic denitrifying bacteria belonging to the genera Sulfurifustis, Sulfuritalea and Sulfuricella. These lineages were detected in greatest abundance at 19 mbgs while the abundances of putative heterotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria belonging to the genus Desulfosporosinus were greatest at 20 mbgs. In addition to help distinguish denitrification from mixing-induced changes in groundwater chemistry, the above observed vertical stratification of the microbial key players connects nitrate removal to the locations of the aquifer sampled.

## Microbiome differential abundance methods produce different results across 38 datasets.
 18.01.2022, _JT Nearing, GM Douglas, MG Hayes, J MacDonald, DK Desai, N Allward, CMA Jones, RJ Wright, AS Dhanani, AM Comeau, MGI Langille_


Identifying differentially abundant microbes is a common goal of microbiome studies. Multiple methods are used interchangeably for this purpose in the literature. Yet, there are few large-scale studies systematically exploring the appropriateness of using these tools interchangeably, and the scale and significance of the differences between them. Here, we compare the performance of 14 differential abundance testing methods on 38 16S rRNA gene datasets with two sample groups. We test for differences in amplicon sequence variants and operational taxonomic units (ASVs) between these groups. Our findings confirm that these tools identified drastically different numbers and sets of significant ASVs, and that results depend on data pre-processing. For many tools the number of features identified correlate with aspects of the data, such as sample size, sequencing depth, and effect size of community differences. ALDEx2 and ANCOM-II produce the most consistent results across studies and agree best with the intersect of results from different approaches. Nevertheless, we recommend that researchers should use a consensus approach based on multiple differential abundance methods to help ensure robust biological interpretations.

## Revealing General Patterns of Microbiomes That Transcend Systems: Potential and Challenges of Deep Transfer Learning.
 18.01.2022, _MM David, C Tataru, Q Pope, LJ Baker, MK English, HE Epstein, A Hammer, M Kent, MJ Sieler, RS Mueller, TJ Sharpton, F Tomas, R Vega Thurber, XZ Fern_


A growing body of research has established that the microbiome can mediate the dynamics and functional capacities of diverse biological systems. Yet, we understand little about what governs the response of these microbial communities to host or environmental changes. Most efforts to model microbiomes focus on defining the relationships between the microbiome, host, and environmental features within a specified study system and therefore fail to capture those that may be evident across multiple systems. In parallel with these developments in microbiome research, computer scientists have developed a variety of machine learning tools that can identify subtle, but informative, patterns from complex data. Here, we recommend using deep transfer learning to resolve microbiome patterns that transcend study systems. By leveraging diverse public data sets in an unsupervised way, such models can learn contextual relationships between features and build on those patterns to perform subsequent tasks (e.g., classification) within specific biological contexts.
