## Microbiota and maintenance of skin barrier function.
 31.05.2022, _TA Harris-Tryon, EA Grice_


_Epithelium, Host Microbial Interactions, Humans, Microbiota, Skin_
Human skin forms a protective barrier against the external environment and is our first line of defense against toxic, solar, and pathogenic insults. Our skin also defines our outward appearance, protects our internal tissues and organs, acts as a sensory interface, and prevents dehydration. Crucial to the skin's barrier function is the colonizing microbiota, which provides protection against pathogens, tunes immune responses, and fortifies the epithelium. Here we highlight recent advances in our understanding of how the microbiota mediates multiple facets of skin barrier function. We discuss recent insights into pathological host-microbiota interactions and implications for disorders of the skin and distant organs. Finally, we examine how microbiota-based mechanisms can be targeted to prevent or manage skin disorders and impaired wound healing.

## Local barriers configure systemic communications between the host and microbiota.
 31.05.2022, _Q Lu, TS Stappenbeck_


_Bacteria, Communication, Fungi, Host Microbial Interactions, Microbiota_
Associations between the dynamic community of microbes (the microbiota) and the host they colonize appear to be vital for ensuring host health. Microbe-host communication is actively maintained across physiological barriers of various body sites and is mediated by a range of bidirectional secreted proteins and small molecules. So far, a range of "omics" methods have succeeded in revealing the multiplicity of associations between members of a microbiota and a wide range of host processes and diseases. Although these advances point to possibilities for treating disease, there has not been much translational success thus far. We know little about which organisms are key contributors to host health, the importance of strain differences, and the activities of much of the chemical "soup" that is produced by the microbiota. Adding to this complexity are emerging hints of the role of interkingdom interactions between bacteria, phages, protozoa, and/or fungi in regulating the microbiota-host interactions. Functional approaches, although experimentally challenging, could be the next step to unlocking the power of the microbiota.

## Immune-microbe interactions early in life: A determinant of health and disease long term.
 31.05.2022, _P Brodin_


_Environmental Exposure, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Microbial Interactions, Microbiota, Symbiosis_
Research on newborn immunity has revealed the importance of cell ontogeny, feto-maternal tolerance, and the transfer of maternal antibodies. Less is known about postnatal adaptation to environmental exposures. The microbiome and its importance for health have been extensively studied, but it remains unclear how mutually beneficial relationships between commensal microbes and human cells first arise and are maintained throughout life. Such immune-microbe mutualism, and perturbations thereof, is most likely a root cause of increasing incidences of immune-mediated disorders such as allergies and autoimmunity across many industrialized nations during the past century. In this Review, I discuss our current understanding of immune development and propose that mismatches among ancestral, early-life, and adult environments can explain perturbations to immune-microbe interactions, immune dysregulation, and increased risks of immune-mediated diseases.

## Production of Indole and Indole-Related Compounds by the Intestinal Microbiota and Consequences for the Host: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
 30.05.2022, _N Tennoune, M Andriamihaja, F Blachier_


The intestinal microbiota metabolic activity towards the available substrates generates myriad bacterial metabolites that may accumulate in the luminal fluid. Among them, indole and indole-related compounds are produced by specific bacterial species from tryptophan. Although indole-related compounds are, first, involved in intestinal microbial community communication, these molecules are also active on the intestinal mucosa, exerting generally beneficial effects in different experimental situations. After absorption, indole is partly metabolized in the liver into the co-metabolite indoxyl sulfate. Although some anti-inflammatory actions of indole on liver cells have been shown, indoxyl sulfate is a well-known uremic toxin that aggravates chronic kidney disease, through deleterious effects on kidney cells. Indoxyl sulfate is also known to provoke endothelial dysfunction. Regarding the central nervous system, emerging research indicates that indole at excessive concentrations displays a negative impact on emotional behavior. The indole-derived co-metabolite isatin appears, in pre-clinical studies, to accumulate in the brain, modulating brain function either positively or negatively, depending on the doses used. Oxindole, a bacterial metabolite that enters the brain, has shown deleterious effects on the central nervous system in experimental studies. Lastly, recent studies performed with indoxyl sulfate report either beneficial or deleterious effects depending once again on the dose used, with missing information on the physiological concentrations that are reaching the central nervous system. Any intervention aiming at modulating indole and indole-related compound concentrations in the biological fluids should crucially take into account the dual effects of these compounds according to the host tissues considered.

## Gut Microbiota-Derived Resveratrol Metabolites, Dihydroresveratrol and Lunularin, Significantly Contribute to the Biological Activities of Resveratrol.
 31.05.2022, _F Li, Y Han, X Wu, X Cao, Z Gao, Y Sun, M Wang, H Xiao_


Although resveratrol (RES) is barely detectable in the plasma and tissues upon oral consumption, collective evidence reveals that RES presents various bioactivities in vivo, including anti-inflammation and anti-cancer. This paradox necessitates further research on profiling and characterizing the biotransformation of RES, as its metabolites may contribute profound biological effects. After 4-week oral administration, 11 metabolites of RES were identified and quantified in mice by HPLC-MS/MS, including dihydro-resveratrol (DHR), lunularin (LUN), and conjugates (sulfates and glucuronides) of RES, DHR and LUN. Importantly, DHR, LUN, and their conjugates were much more abundantly distributed in tissues, gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and biological fluids compared to RES and its conjugates. Moreover, we established that DHR and LUN were gut bacteria-derived metabolites of RES, as indicated by their depletion in antibiotic-treated mice. Furthermore, the biological activities of RES, DHR, and LUN were determined at physiologically relevant levels. DHR and LUN exhibited stronger anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects than RES at the concentrations found in mouse tissues. In summary, our study profiled the tissue distribution of the metabolites of RES after its oral administration in mice and uncovered the important role of gut microbial metabolites of RES in the biological activities of RES in vivo.

## Widespread stop-codon recoding in bacteriophages may regulate translation of lytic genes.
 26.05.2022, _AL Borges, YC Lou, R Sachdeva, B Al-Shayeb, PI Penev, AL Jaffe, S Lei, JM Santini, JF Banfield_


Bacteriophages (phages) are obligate parasites that use host bacterial translation machinery to produce viral proteins. However, some phages have alternative genetic codes with reassigned stop codons that are predicted to be incompatible with bacterial translation systems. We analysed 9,422 phage genomes and found that stop-codon recoding has evolved in diverse clades of phages that infect bacteria present in both human and animal gut microbiota. Recoded stop codons are particularly over-represented in phage structural and lysis genes. We propose that recoded stop codons might function to prevent premature production of late-stage proteins. Stop-codon recoding has evolved several times in closely related lineages, which suggests that adaptive recoding can occur over very short evolutionary timescales.

## Dynamic colonization of gut microbiota and its influencing factors among the breast-feeding infants during the first two years of life.
 27.05.2022, _P Li, X Chang, X Chen, T Tang, Y Liu, Y Shang, K Qi_


The maturation of infant gut microbiota has lifelong implications on health, which has been proposed as the major events during the first year of life. However, little is known about their dynamic colonization and influencing elements among the first two-year infancy as well as into the adulthood. So based on the 16S rRNA sequencing data among 30 healthy breast-feeding mother-infant pairs with normal ranges of growth and development indicators from birth to two years old, the dynamic colonization of gut microbiota and its influencing factors were discussed using this birth cohort. Among these, we identified that the diversity of gut microbiota was significantly increased from six-month to two-year subgroups. The significantly dynamic trends of gut microbiota at the phylum (genus) level were that the percents of Firmicutes (Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Enterococcus, Subdoligranulum, Agathobacter, unidentified_Erysipelotrichaceae, Staphylococcus, unidentified_Ruminococcaceae, and Fusicatenibacter), Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were increased, while Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium) and Proteobacteria (unidentified-Enterobacteriaceae and Klebsiella) were decreased with the increased ages from six months to two years old, which might simultaneously modulate the host pathways, such as the higher percents of chemoheterotrophy and fermentation, and lower percentages of nitrate_reduction, aerobic_chemoheterotrophy and so on. Furthermore, there were significant associations between maternal (milk microbiota, pre-pregnancy BMI, BMI increment during the pregnancy)/infant characteristics (BMI at birth and BMI gain), and the compositions of gut microbiota. However, no differences of gut microbiota were shown between the different sex and productive mode subgroups. Overall, the colonization of gut microbiota is significantly matured into the adulthood with the increased ages to two-years old and regulated by the above maternal/infant characteristics, which will provide a new direction for the host-gut microbiota interplay during the first two years of life.

## Lysophosphatidylserines derived from microbiota in Crohn's disease elicit pathological Th1 response.

Microbiota alteration and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cell overactivation are implicated in Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear how dysbiosis enhances Th1 responses, leading to intestinal inflammation. Here, we identified key metabolites derived from dysbiotic microbiota that induce enhanced Th1 responses and exaggerate colitis in mouse models. Patients with CD showed elevated lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) concentration in their feces, accompanied by a higher relative abundance of microbiota possessing a gene encoding the phospholipid-hydrolyzing enzyme phospholipase A. LysoPS induced metabolic reprogramming, thereby eliciting aberrant effector responses in both human and mouse IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells. Administration of LysoPS into two mouse colitis models promoted large intestinal inflammation. LysoPS-induced aggravation of colitis was impaired in mice lacking P2ry10 and P2ry10b, and their CD4+ T cells were hyporesponsive to LysoPS. Thus, our findings elaborate on the mechanism by which metabolites elevated in patients with CD harboring dysbiotic microbiota promote Th1-mediated intestinal pathology.
