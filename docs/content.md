By age 5, approximately one-fifth of children have early childhood caries (ECC). Both the oral microbiome and host genetics are thought to influence susceptibility. Whether the oral microbiome modifies genetic susceptibility to ECC has not been tested. We test whether the salivary bacteriome modifies the association of a polygenic score (PGS, a score derived from genomic data that summarizes genetic susceptibility to disease) for primary tooth decay on ECC in the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia 2 longitudinal birth cohort. Children were genotyped using the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array and underwent annual dental examinations. We constructed a PGS for primary tooth decay using weights from an independent, genome-wide association meta-analysis. Using Poisson regression, we tested for associations between the PGS (high versus low) and ECC incidence, adjusting for demographic characteristics (n = 783). An incidence-density sampled subset of the cohort (n = 138) had salivary bacteriome data at 24 mo of age. We tested for effect modification of the PGS on ECC case status by salivary bacterial community state type (CST). By 60 mo, 20.69% of children had ECC. High PGS was not associated with an increased rate of ECC (incidence rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.42). However, having a cariogenic salivary bacterial CST at 24 mo was associated with ECC (odds ratio [OR], 7.48; 95% CI, 3.06-18.26), which was robust to PGS adjustment. An interaction existed between the salivary bacterial CST and the PGS on the multiplicative scale (P = 0.04). The PGS was associated with ECC (OR, 4.83; 95% CI, 1.29-18.17) only among individuals with a noncariogenic salivary bacterial CST (n = 70). Genetic causes of caries may be harder to detect when not accounting for cariogenic oral microbiomes. As certain salivary bacterial CSTs increased ECC risk across genetic risk strata, preventing colonization of cariogenic microbiomes would be universally beneficial.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous cognitive, behavioral and communication impairments. Disruption of the gut-brain axis (GBA) has been implicated in ASD although with limited reproducibility across studies. In this study, we developed a Bayesian differential ranking algorithm to identify ASD-associated molecular and taxa profiles across 10 cross-sectional microbiome datasets and 15 other datasets, including dietary patterns, metabolomics, cytokine profiles and human brain gene expression profiles. We found a functional architecture along the GBA that correlates with heterogeneity of ASD phenotypes, and it is characterized by ASD-associated amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid profiles predominantly encoded by microbial species in the genera Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Desulfovibrio and Bacteroides and correlates with brain gene expression changes, restrictive dietary patterns and pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles. The functional architecture revealed in age-matched and sex-matched cohorts is not present in sibling-matched cohorts. We also show a strong association between temporal changes in microbiome composition and ASD phenotypes. In summary, we propose a framework to leverage multi-omic datasets from well-defined cohorts and investigate how the GBA influences ASD.

## Human gut bacteria tailor extracellular vesicle cargo for the breakdown of diet- and host-derived glycans.

_Humans, Proteomics, Extracellular Vesicles, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Diet, Polysaccharides, Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins_
Extracellular vesicles are produced in all three domains of life, and their biogenesis has common ancient origins in eukaryotes and archaea. Although bacterial vesicles were discovered several decades ago and multiple roles have been attributed to them, no mechanism has been established for vesicles biogenesis in bacteria. For this reason, there is a significant level of skepticism about the biological relevance of bacterial vesicles. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt), a prominent member of the human intestinal microbiota, produces significant amounts of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) which have been proposed to play key physiological roles. Here, we employed a dual marker system, consisting of outer membrane- and OMV-specific markers fused to fluorescent proteins to visualize OMV biogenesis by time-lapse microscopy. Furthermore, we performed comparative proteomic analyses to show that, in Bt, the OMV cargo is adapted for the optimal utilization of different polysaccharides. We also show that a negatively charged N-terminal motif acts as a signal for protein sorting into OMVs irrespective of the nutrient availability. Our results demonstrate that OMV production is the result of a highly regulated process in Bt.

## Gut OncoMicrobiome Signatures (GOMS) as next-generation biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy.
 26.06.2023, _AM Thomas, M Fidelle, B Routy, G Kroemer, JA Wargo, N Segata, L Zitvogel_


Oncogenesis is associated with intestinal dysbiosis, and stool shotgun metagenomic sequencing in individuals with this condition might constitute a non-invasive approach for the early diagnosis of several cancer types. The prognostic relevance of antibiotic intake and gut microbiota composition urged investigators to develop tools for the detection of intestinal dysbiosis to enable patient stratification and microbiota-centred clinical interventions. Moreover, since the advent of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in oncology, the identification of biomarkers for predicting their efficacy before starting treatment has been an unmet medical need. Many previous studies addressing this question, including a meta-analysis described herein, have led to the description of Gut OncoMicrobiome Signatures (GOMS). In this Review, we discuss how patients with cancer across various subtypes share several GOMS with individuals with seemingly unrelated chronic inflammatory disorders who, in turn, tend to have GOMS different from those of healthy individuals. We discuss findings from the aforementioned meta-analysis of GOMS patterns associated with clinical benefit from or resistance to ICIs across different cancer types (in 808 patients), with a focus on metabolic and immunological surrogate markers of intestinal dysbiosis, and propose practical guidelines to incorporate GOMS in decision-making for prospective clinical trials in immuno-oncology.

## Current concepts, advances, and challenges in deciphering the human microbiota with metatranscriptomics.
 26.06.2023, _T Ojala, AE Häkkinen, E Kankuri, M Kankainen_


Metatranscriptomics refers to the analysis of the collective microbial transcriptome of a sample. Its increased utilization for the characterization of human-associated microbial communities has enabled the discovery of many disease-state related microbial activities. Here, we review the principles of metatranscriptomics-based analysis of human-associated microbial samples. We describe strengths and weaknesses of popular sample preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatics approaches and summarize strategies for their use. We then discuss how human-associated microbial communities have recently been examined and how their characterization may change. We conclude that metatranscriptomics insights into human microbiotas under health and disease have not only expanded our knowledge on human health, but also opened avenues for rational antimicrobial drug use and disease management.

## Bacteria from the gut influence the host micronutrient status.
 27.06.2023, _DK Dje Kouadio, F Wieringa, V Greffeuille, C Humblot_


Micronutrient deficiencies or "hidden hunger" remains a serious public health problem in most low- and middle-income countries, with severe consequences for child development. Traditional methods of treatment and prevention, such as supplementation and fortification, have not always proven to be effective and may have undesirable side-effects (i.e., digestive troubles with iron supplementation). Commensal bacteria in the gut may increase bioavailability of specific micronutrients (i.e., minerals), notably by removing anti-nutritional compounds, such as phytates and polyphenols, or by the synthesis of vitamins. Together with the gastrointestinal mucosa, gut microbiota is also the first line of protection against pathogens. It contributes to the reinforcement of the integrity of the intestinal epithelium and to a better absorption of micronutrients. However, its role in micronutrient malnutrition is still poorly understood. Moreover, the bacterial metabolism is also dependent of micronutrients acquired from the gut environment and resident bacteria may compete or collaborate to maintain micronutrient homeostasis. Gut microbiota composition can therefore be modulated by micronutrient availability. This review brings together current knowledge on this two-way relationship between micronutrients and gut microbiota bacteria, with a focus on iron, zinc, vitamin A and folate (vitamin B9), as these deficiencies are public health concerns in a global context.

## Calorie restriction mimetic drugs could favorably influence gut microbiota leading to lifespan extension.
 30.06.2023, _T Shintani, H Shintani, M Sato, H Ashida_


Calorie restriction (CR) can prolong human lifespan, but enforcing long-term CR is difficult. Thus, a drug that reproduces the effects of CR without CR is required. More than 10 drugs have been listed as CR mimetics (CRM), and some of which are conventionally categorized as upstream-type CRMs showing glycolytic inhibition, whereas the others are categorized as downstream-type CRMs that regulate or genetically modulate intracellular signaling proteins. Intriguingly, recent reports have revealed the beneficial effects of CRMs on the body such as improving the host body condition via intestinal bacteria and their metabolites. This beneficial effect of gut microbiota may lead to lifespan extension. Thus, CRMs may have a dual effect on longevity. However, no reports have collectively discussed them as CRMs; hence, our knowledge about CRM and its physiological effects on the host remains fragmentary. This study is the first to present and collectively discuss the accumulative evidence of CRMs improving the gut environments for healthy lifespan extension, after enumerating the latest scientific findings related to the gut microbiome and CR. The conclusion drawn from this discussion is that CRM may partially extend the lifespan through its effect on the gut microbiota. CRMs increase beneficial bacteria abundance by decreasing harmful bacteria rather than increasing the diversity of the microbiome. Thus, the effect of CRMs on the gut could be different from that of conventional prebiotics and seemed similar to that of next-generation prebiotics.

Accumulating studies have shown the effects of gut microbiota management tools in improving depression. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on patients with depression. We searched six databases up to July 2022. In total, 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 786 participants were included. The overall results demonstrated that patients who received prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics had significantly improved symptoms of depression compared with those in the placebo group. However, subgroup analysis only confirmed the significant antidepressant effects of agents that contained probiotics. In addition, patients with mild or moderate depression could both benefit from the treatment. Studies with a lower proportion of females reported stronger effects for alleviating depressive symptoms. In conclusion, agents that manipulate gut microbiota might improve mild-to-moderate depression. It is necessary to further investigate the benefits of prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic treatments relative to antidepressants and follow up with individuals over a longer time before these therapies are implemented in clinical practice.

Despite their role in host nutrition, the anaerobic gut fungal (AGF) component of the herbivorous gut microbiome remains poorly characterized. Here, to examine global patterns and determinants of AGF diversity, we generate and analyze an amplicon dataset from 661 fecal samples from 34 mammalian species, 9 families, and 6 continents. We identify 56 novel genera, greatly expanding AGF diversity beyond current estimates (31 genera and candidate genera). Community structure analysis indicates that host phylogenetic affiliation, not domestication status and biogeography, shapes the community rather than. Fungal-host associations are stronger and more specific in hindgut fermenters than in foregut fermenters. Transcriptomics-enabled phylogenomic and molecular clock analyses of 52 strains from 14 genera indicate that most genera with preferences for hindgut hosts evolved earlier (44-58 Mya) than those with preferences for foregut hosts (22-32 Mya). Our results greatly expand the documented scope of AGF diversity and provide an ecologically and evolutionary-grounded model to explain the observed patterns of AGF diversity in extant animal hosts.

## Tutorial: integrative computational analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data to characterize tumor immunity using RIMA.

RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has become an increasingly cost-effective technique for molecular profiling and immune characterization of tumors. In the past decade, many computational tools have been developed to characterize tumor immunity from gene expression data. However, the analysis of large-scale RNA-seq data requires bioinformatics proficiency, large computational resources and cancer genomics and immunology knowledge. In this tutorial, we provide an overview of computational analysis of bulk RNA-seq data for immune characterization of tumors and introduce commonly used computational tools with relevance to cancer immunology and immunotherapy. These tools have diverse functions such as evaluation of expression signatures, estimation of immune infiltration, inference of the immune repertoire, prediction of immunotherapy response, neoantigen detection and microbiome quantification. We describe the RNA-seq IMmune Analysis (RIMA) pipeline integrating many of these tools to streamline RNA-seq analysis. We also developed a comprehensive and user-friendly guide in the form of a GitBook with text and video demos to assist users in analyzing bulk RNA-seq data for immune characterization at both individual sample and cohort levels by using RIMA.
