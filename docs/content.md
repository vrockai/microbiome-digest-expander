Microorganisms coexist in a complex milieu of bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses on or within the human body, often as multifaceted polymicrobial biofilm communities at mucosal sites and on abiotic surfaces. Only recently have we begun to appreciate the complicated biofilm phenotype during infection; moreover, even less is known about the interactions that occur between microorganisms during polymicrobial growth and their implications in human disease. Therefore, this review focuses on polymicrobial biofilm-mediated infections and examines the contribution of bacterial-bacterial, bacterial-fungal, and bacterial-viral interactions during human infection and potential strategies for protection against such diseases.

## Influence of timing of maternal antibiotic administration during caesarean section on infant microbial colonisation: a randomised controlled trial.

Revised guidelines for caesarean section (CS) advise maternal antibiotic administration prior to skin incision instead of after umbilical cord clamping, unintentionally exposing the infant to antibiotics antenatally. We aimed to investigate if timing of intrapartum antibiotics contributes to the impairment of microbiota colonisation in CS born infants.

## Predominance of Staphylococcus correlates with wound burden and disease activity in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: a prospective case-control study.

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is characterized by skin blistering and wounds. To uncover changes in skin and mucosal microbiome related to age and disease progression, and microbiome impact on clinical and inflammatory laboratory parameters, swabs from wounded and unwounded skin, oral mucosa and stool samples of 28 children with RDEB and 28 healthy controls were subjected to 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. Skin microbiome of RDEB patients showed significantly reduced alpha diversity compared to healthy controls and early, age-dependent predominance of Staphylococcus aureus first in wounds, then in unwounded skin. These findings were more pronounced in severe disease with higher abundances of Staphylococcus aureus compared to intermediate disease. Staphylococcus aureus abundance correlated significantly with both acute and chronic wound burden. Changes in oral mucosal and gut microbiome were discrete with no significant differences in alpha diversity. Our findings show that children with RDEB experience skin microbiome changes early in life. Longitudinal studies should confirm that dysbiosis starts in wounds and later extends to unwounded skin. The predominance of Staphylococcus aureus significantly correlates with wound burden and disease activity, and to some extent with systemic inflammation.

## Comparability of microbiota of swabbed and spit saliva.
 26.02.2022, _AM Kaan, BW Brandt, MJ Buijs, W Crielaard, BJ Keijser, E Zaura_


In general, saliva is used for microbiota analysis in longitudinal studies, and several collection methods are being used. Using a robust sample collection procedure is important, as it may influence salivary composition. This study explored the comparability of the microbiota of swabbed and spit saliva. Twenty-two females participated in this cross-sectional study. The bacterial composition of the three saliva samples (swab collected by the participant (SW-P), swab collected by the researcher (SW-R), and spit (SP) was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The bacterial composition of the swabbed and the spit saliva was significantly different irrespective of the operator, and Shannon diversity was significantly higher in spit saliva than in SW-P and SW-R. The salivary microbiota of spit and swabbed adult saliva differs significantly. Research on microbial composition therefore requires collection of similar saliva sample types in all study participants.

## A multiple-dimension model for microbiota of patients with colorectal cancer from normal participants and other intestinal disorders.

Gut microbiota is a primary driver of inflammation in the colon and is linked to early colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Thus, a novel and noninvasive microbiome-based model could promote screening in patients at average risk for CRC. Nevertheless, the relevance and effectiveness of microbial biomarkers for noninvasive CRC screening remains unclear, and researchers lack the data to distinguish CRC-related gut microbiome biomarkers from those of other common gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Microbiome-based classification distinguishes patients with CRC from normal participants and excludes other CRC-relevant diseases (e.g., GI bleed, adenoma, bowel diseases, and postoperative). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 92.2%. Known associations with oral pathogenic features, benefits-generated features, and functional features of CRC were confirmed using the model. Our optimised prediction model was established using large-scale experimental population-based data and other sequence-based faecal microbial community data. This model can be used to identify the high-risk groups and has the potential to become a novel screening method for CRC biomarkers because of its low false-positive rate (FPR) and good stability. KEY POINTS: • A total of 5744 CRC and non-CRC large-scale faecal samples were sequenced, and a model was constructed for CRC discrimination on the basis of the relative abundance of taxonomic and functional features. • This model could identify high-risk groups and become a novel screening method for CRC biomarkers because of its low FPR and good stability. • The association relationship of oral pathogenic features, benefits-generated features, and functional features in CRC was confirmed by the study.

## Associations between Drinking Water Source and Gut Microbiota Composition in the American Gut Project Database.

## Rethinking Parkinson Disease: Exploring Gut-Brain Interactions and the Potential Role of Exercise.
 28.02.2022, _K Zapanta, ET Schroeder, BE Fisher_


Although Parkinson disease (PD) has traditionally been considered a disease of the central nervous system, a bidirectional communication system known as the gut-brain axis (GBA) may influence PD pathogenesis. The dual-hit hypothesis proposed that PD is due to peripheral dysregulations to the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis. Since then, further investigation has shown that there are multiple pathologic sources associated with PD. However, dysbiosis plays a critical role in the disease process. Substantial evidence has identified that cardinal motor symptoms of PD and disease progression are associated with dysbiosis. In other neurodegenerative disorders, dysbiosis has been linked to cognition. Non-PD research has shown that exercise can effectively restore the gut microbiota. Likewise, exercise has become a well-established strategy to improve cognitive and motor function in PD. However, despite the interaction between the gut and brain, and the exercise benefits on gut health, no research to date has considered the effects of exercise on the gut microbiota in PD. Therefore, the purpose of this perspective is to explore whether exercise benefits observed in PD may be partly due to restorations to the gut microbiota. First, we will review the GBA and its influence on motor and cognitive function. Next, we will outline evidence regarding exercise-induced restoration of the gut microbiota in non-PD populations. Finally, we will summarize benefits of exercise on motor-cognitive function in PD, proposing that benefits of exercise seen in PD may actually be due to restorations to the gut microbiota. By positing the gut microbiota as a moderator of exercise improvements to motor and cognitive function, we aim to provide a new perspective for physical therapists to prioritize exercise regimens for individuals with PD that can specifically restore the gut microbiota to better-improve PD symptoms and prognosis.
