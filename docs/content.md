Humans are host to a multitude of microorganisms that rapidly populate the body at birth, subject to a complex interplay that is dependent on host genetics, lifestyle, and environment. The host-associated microbiome, including the oral microbiome, presents itself in a complex ecosystem important to health and disease. As the most common chronic disease globally, dental caries is induced by host-microbial dysbiosis in children and adults. Multiple biological and environmental factors are likely to impact disease predisposition, onset, progression, and severity, yet longitudinal studies able to capture these influences are missing. To investigate how host genetics and environment influenced the oral microbial communities over time, we profiled supragingival plaque microbiomes of dizygotic and monozygotic twins during 3 visits over 12-months. Dental plaque DNA samples were amplified by targeting the 16S rRNA gene V4 region, and microbial findings were correlated with clinical, diet and genetic metadata. We observed that the oral microbiome variances were shaped primarily by the environment when compared to host genetics. Among the environmental factors shaping microbial changes of our subjects, significant metadata included age of the subject, and the age by which subjects initiated brushing habits, and the types of actions post-brushing. Relevant heritability of the microbiome included Actinomyces and Capnocytophaga in monozygotic twins and Kingella in dizygotic twins. Corynebacterium and Veillonella abundances were associated with age, whereas Aggregatibacter was associated with younger subjects. Streptococcus abundance showed an inverse association over time, and Selenomonas abundances increased with brushing frequency per day. Unraveling the exact biological mechanisms in caries has the potential to reveal novel host-microbial biomarkers, pathways, and targets important to effective preventive measures, and early disease control in children.

## Early signs of gut microbiome aging: biomarkers of inflammation, metabolism, and macromolecular damage in young adulthood.

Emerging links between gut microbiota and diseases of aging point to possible shared immune, metabolic, and cellular damage mechanisms, operating long before diseases manifest. We conducted 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples collected from a subsample (n=668) of Add Health Wave V, a nationally representative longitudinal study of adults aged 32-42. An overlapping subsample (n=345) included whole blood RNA-seq. We examined associations between fecal taxonomic abundances and dried blood spot-based markers of lipid and glucose homeostasis and C-reactive protein (measured in Wave IV), as well as gene expression markers of inflammation, cellular damage, immune cell composition, and transcriptomic age (measured in Wave V), using Bayesian hierarchical models adjusted for potential confounders. We additionally estimated a co-abundance network between inflammation-related genes and bacterial taxa using penalized Gaussian graphical models. Strong and consistent microbiota associations emerged for HbA1c, glucose, C-reactive protein, and principal components of genes upregulated in inflammation, DNA repair, and reactive oxygen species, with Streptococcus infantis, Pseudomonas spp., and Peptoniphilus as major players for each. This pattern was largely echoed (though attenuated) for immunologic cell composition gene sets, and only Serratia varied meaningfully by transcriptomic age. Network co-abundance indicated relationships between Prevotella sp., Bacteroides sp., and Ruminococcus sp. and gut immune/metabolic regulatory activity, and Ruminococcussp, Dialister, and Butyrivibriocrossotus with balance between Th1 and Th2 inflammation. In conclusion, many common associations between microbiota and major physiologic aging mechanisms are evident in early-mid adulthood, and suggest avenues for early detection and prevention of accelerated aging.

## Lactobacillus plantarum FRT10 alleviated high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice through regulating the PPARα signal pathway and gut microbiota.
 15.05.2020, _H Cai, Z Wen, X Li, K Meng, P Yang_


Previous studies showed that probiotics supplementation contributed to alleviate obesity. This work was to assess the efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum FRT10 from sour dough in alleviating obesity in mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD), and the underlying mechanisms focusing on modulation of the gut microbiota profile. Kunming mice were fed with a regular diet (CT), a high-fat diet (HFD), and two HFDs containing low and high doses of L. plantarum FRT10 for 8 weeks. The physiological and biochemical modulations in liver were analyzed. Cecal contents were analyzed by high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. FRT10 supplementation significantly reduced body weight gain, fat weight, and liver triacylglycerols (TGs) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations (P &lt; 0.05). FRT10 significantly ameliorated the HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, as evidenced by increased abundance of microbes, including Butyricicoccus, Butyricimonas, Intestinimonas, Odoribacter, and Alistipes, and decreased abundance of Desulfovibrionaceae, Roseburia, and Lachnoclostridium. Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia were markedly increased after FRT10 intervention. In addition, real-time quantitative PCR revealed that FRT10 upregulated the mRNA expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT1α), and downregulated the mRNA expression levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and TG-synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) in liver. These findings suggested that FRT10 had anti-obesity effects in obese mice partly related to the activation of PPARα/CPT1α pathway. FRT10 can be considered a single probiotic agent for preventing HFD-induced obesity in humans and animals.

## Factors affecting the microbiome of Ixodes scapularis and Amblyomma americanum.
 18.05.2020, _RJ Brinkerhoff, C Clark, K Ocasio, DT Gauthier, WL Hynes_


The microbial community composition of disease vectors can impact pathogen establishment and transmission as well as on vector behavior and fitness. While data on vector microbiota are accumulating quickly, determinants of the variation in disease vector microbial communities are incompletely understood. We explored the microbiome of two human-biting tick species abundant in eastern North America (Amblyomma americanum and Ixodes scapularis) to identify the relative contribution of tick species, tick life stage, tick sex, environmental context and vertical transmission to the richness, diversity, and species composition of the tick microbiome. We sampled 89 adult and nymphal Ixodes scapularis (N = 49) and Amblyomma americanum (N = 40) from two field sites and characterized the microbiome of each individual using the v3-v4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. We identified significant variation in microbial community composition due to tick species and life stage with lesser impact of sampling site. Compared to unfed nymphs and males, the microbiome of engorged adult female I. scapularis, as well as the egg masses they produced, were low in bacterial richness and diversity and were dominated by Rickettsia, suggesting strong vertical transmission of this genus. Likewise, microbiota of A. americanum nymphs and males were more diverse than those of adult females. Among bacteria of public health importance, we detected several different Rickettsia sequence types, several of which were distinct from known species. Borrelia was relatively common in I. scapularis but did not show the same level of sequence variation as Rickettsia. Several bacterial genera were significantly over-represented in Borrelia-infected I. scapularis, suggesting a potential interaction of facilitative relationship between these taxa; no OTUs were under-represented in Borrelia-infected ticks. The systematic sampling we conducted for this study allowed us to partition the variation in tick microbial composition as a function of tick- and environmentally-related factors. Upon more complete understanding of the forces that shape the tick microbiome it will be possible to design targeted experimental studies to test the impacts of individual taxa and suites of microbes on vector-borne pathogen transmission and on vector biology.
