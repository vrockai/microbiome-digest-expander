## Exploring the Influence of Gut Microbiome on Energy Metabolism in Humans.
 09.04.2023, _J Montenegro, AM Armet, B Willing, EC Deehan, PG Fassini, JF Mota, J Walter, CM Prado_


The gut microbiome has a profound influence on host physiology, including energy metabolism, which is the process by which energy from nutrients is transformed to other forms of energy to be used by the body. However, mechanistic evidence for how the microbiome influences energy metabolism is derived from animal models. In this narrative review, we included human studies investigating the relation between gut microbiome and energy metabolism - i.e., energy expenditure in humans and energy harvest by the gut microbiome. Studies have found no consistent gut microbiome patterns associated with energy metabolism, and most interventions were not effective in modulating the gut microbiome to influence energy metabolism. To date, cause-and-effect relationships, and mechanistic evidence on the impact of the gut microbiome on energy expenditure have not been established in humans. Future longitudinal observational studies and randomized controlled trials utilizing robust methodologies and advanced statistical analysis are needed. Such knowledge would potentially inform the design of therapeutic avenues and specific dietary recommendations to improve energy metabolism through gut microbiome modulation.

## Ruminococcus gnavus: friend or foe for human health.
 04.04.2023, _EH Crost, E Coletto, A Bell, N Juge_


Ruminococcus gnavus was first identified in 1974 as a strict anaerobe in the gut of healthy individuals, and for several decades, its study has been limited to specific enzymes or bacteriocins. With the advent of metagenomics, R. gnavus has been associated both positively and negatively with an increasing number of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases from inflammatory bowel diseases to neurological disorders. This prompted renewed interest in understanding the adaptation mechanisms of R. gnavus to the gut, and the molecular mediators affecting its association with health and disease. From ca. 250 publications citing R. gnavus since 1990, 94% were published in the last 10 years. In this review, we describe the biological characterisation of R. gnavus, its occurrence in the infant and adult gut microbiota and the factors influencing its colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract; we also discuss the current state of our knowledge on its role in host health and disease. We highlight gaps in knowledge and discuss the hypothesis that differential health outcomes associated with R. gnavus in the gut are strain and niche specific.

Gastric cancer (GC) has been identified as the third deadly cancer in the world. Accumulating researches suggest a potential role of microorganisms in tumorigenesis. However, the composition of microbiota in GC tissues is not clear and it changes throughout the different stages of GC remain mostly elusive. Our study integrated RNA-Seq data of 727 samples derived from gastric tissues across four datasets and revealed its microbial composition. In order to remove the false positive results, core taxa were defined and characterized. Based on it, we analyzed the influence of biological factors on its composition. The pan-microbiome of gastric tissues was estimated to be over than 1400 genera. Seventeen core genera were identified. Among them, Helicobacter, Lysobacter were significantly enriched in normal tissues, while Pseudomonas was enriched in tumor tissues. Interestingly, Acinetobacter, Pasteurella, Streptomyces, Chlamydia, and Lysobacter, showed a significant increase trend during tumor development and formed strong intra/inter-correlations among them or with other genera. Furthermore, we found that tumor stage played an important role in altering the microbial composition of GC tissues. This study provides support for the in-depth study of tumor microbiome, and the specific microbiome excavated provides a possibility for the subsequent identification of potential biomarkers for GC.

Intermittent fasting (IF) is a promising paradigm for weight loss which has been shown to modulate the gut microbiota based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Here, 72 Chinese volunteers with a wide range of body mass index (BMI) participated in a three-week IF program during which an average loss of 3.67 kg body weight accompanied with improved clinical parameters was observed irrespective of initial anthropometric and gut microbiota status. Fecal samples were collected before and after the intervention and subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing. De novo assembly yielded 2934 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Profiling revealed significant enrichment of Parabacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron after the intervention, with inverse correlations between their relative abundances and parameters related to obesity and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD). MAGs enriched after the intervention showed high richness and diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes, with an increased relative abundances of genes related to succinate production and glutamate fermentation.

## The secondary bile acid isoursodeoxycholate correlates with post-prandial lipemia, inflammation, and appetite and changes post-bariatric surgery.

Primary and secondary bile acids (BAs) influence metabolism and inflammation, and the gut microbiome modulates levels of BAs. We systematically explore the host genetic, gut microbial, and habitual dietary contribution to a panel of 19 serum and 15 stool BAs in two population-based cohorts (TwinsUK, n = 2,382; ZOE PREDICT-1, n = 327) and assess changes post-bariatric surgery and after nutritional interventions. We report that BAs have a moderately heritable genetic component, and the gut microbiome accurately predicts their levels in serum and stool. The secondary BA isoursodeoxycholate (isoUDCA) can be explained mostly by gut microbes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = ∼80%) and associates with post-prandial lipemia and inflammation (GlycA). Furthermore, circulating isoUDCA decreases significantly 1 year after bariatric surgery (β = -0.72, p = 1 × 10-5) and in response to fiber supplementation (β = -0.37, p &lt; 0.03) but not omega-3 supplementation. In healthy individuals, isoUDCA fasting levels correlate with pre-meal appetite (p &lt; 1 × 10-4). Our findings indicate an important role for isoUDCA in lipid metabolism, appetite, and, potentially, cardiometabolic risk.

## Forging the microbiome to help us live long and prosper.
 05.04.2023, _RR Rock, PJ Turnbaugh_


Aging is often accompanied by an increased risk of an array of diseases spanning the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems, among others. Despite remarkable progress in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in aging, the role of the microbiome remains understudied. In this Essay, we highlight recent progress towards understanding if and how the microbiome contributes to aging and age-associated diseases. Furthermore, we discuss the need to consider sexually dimorphic phenotypes in the context of aging and the microbiome. We also highlight the broad implications for this emerging area of interdisciplinary research to address long-standing questions about host-microbiome interactions across the life span.
