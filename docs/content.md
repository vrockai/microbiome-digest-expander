## Allergic rhinitis and COVID-19: friends or foes?
 10.09.2021, _F Gani, M Cottini, M Landi, A Berti, P Comberiati, D Peroni, G Senna, C Lombardi_


Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common disease affecting up to 40% of the general population worldwide. In the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic era, many observational studies analysing the effect of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on the risk of developing COVID-19 were conducted, while data on AR are limited.In this paper, we review the risk of developing SARS-Cov-2 infection carried by AR patients, the outcomes of those with COVID-19 disease, and the COVID-19 influence on the allergic and nasal symptoms and the psychological status of AR patients, in both adult and paediatric populations.AR patients seem to be protected from COVID 19 infection. Even if data about the influence of AR on the severity of COVID-19 disease are still not conclusive, it seems that being an AR patient does not increase the risk of poor COVID-19 prognoses. The clinical manifestation of AR can be distinguished by COVID-19 symptoms. Treating AR adequately is also strongly recommended, especially during pandemic.
