The gut microbiome has been implicated in a variety of physiological states, but controversy over causality remains unresolved. Here, we performed bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses on 3,432 Chinese individuals with whole-genome, whole-metagenome, anthropometric and blood metabolic trait data. We identified 58 causal relationships between the gut microbiome and blood metabolites, and replicated 43 of them. Increased relative abundances of fecal Oscillibacter and Alistipes were causally linked to decreased triglyceride concentration. Conversely, blood metabolites such as glutamic acid appeared to decrease fecal Oxalobacter, and members of Proteobacteria were influenced by metabolites such as 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, alanine, glutamate and selenium. Two-sample Mendelian randomization with data from Biobank Japan partly corroborated results with triglyceride and with uric acid, and also provided causal support for published fecal bacterial markers for cancer and cardiovascular diseases. This study illustrates the value of human genetic information to help prioritize gut microbial features for mechanistic and clinical studies.

## Determine independent gut microbiota-diseases association by eliminating the effects of human lifestyle factors.
 04.01.2022, _C Zhu, X Wang, J Li, R Jiang, H Chen, T Chen, Y Yang_


Lifestyle and physiological variables on human disease risk have been revealed to be mediated by gut microbiota. Low concordance between case-control studies for detecting disease-associated microbe existed due to limited sample size and population-wide bias in lifestyle and physiological variables. To infer gut microbiota-disease associations accurately, we propose to build machine learning models by including both human variables and gut microbiota. When the model's performance with both gut microbiota and human variables is better than the model with just human variables, the independent gut microbiota -disease associations will be confirmed. By building models on the American Gut Project dataset, we found that gut microbiota showed distinct association strengths with different diseases. Adding gut microbiota into human variables enhanced the classification performance of IBD significantly; independent associations between occurrence information of gut microbiota and irritable bowel syndrome, C. difficile infection, and unhealthy status were found; adding gut microbiota showed no improvement on models' performance for diabetes, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, cardiovascular disease. Our results suggested that although gut microbiota was reported to be associated with many diseases, a considerable proportion of these associations may be very weak. We proposed a list of microbes as biomarkers to classify IBD and unhealthy status. Further functional investigations of these microbes will improve understanding of the molecular mechanism of human diseases.

## A Comprehensive Review on the Role of the Gut Microbiome in Human Neurological Disorders.
 05.01.2022, _SG Sorboni, HS Moghaddam, R Jafarzadeh-Esfehani, S Soleimanpour_


The human body is full of an extensive number of commensal microbes, consisting of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively termed the human microbiome. The initial acquisition of microbiota occurs from both the external and maternal environments, and the vast majority of them colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These microbial communities play a central role in the maturation and development of the immune system, the central nervous system, and the GIT system and are also responsible for essential metabolic pathways. Various factors, including host genetic predisposition, environmental factors, lifestyle, diet, antibiotic or nonantibiotic drug use, etc., affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Recent publications have highlighted that an imbalance in the gut microflora, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Moreover, characterization of the microbiome-host cross talk pathways provides insight into novel therapeutic strategies. Novel preclinical and clinical research on interventions related to the gut microbiome for treating neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke, hold significant promise. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the potential involvement of the human gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, with a particular emphasis on the potential of microbe-based therapies and/or diagnostic microbial biomarkers. This review also discusses the potential health benefits of the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation in neurological disorders.

## Contrasting Effects of Local Environmental and Biogeographic Factors on the Composition and Structure of Bacterial Communities in Arid Monospecific Mangrove Soils.
 05.01.2022, _T Thomson, M Fusi, MF Bennett-Smith, N Prinz, E Aylagas, S Carvalho, CE Lovelock, BH Jones, JI Ellis_


Mangrove forests are important biotic sinks of atmospheric CO2 and play an integral role in nutrient-cycling and decontamination of coastal waters, thereby mitigating climatic and anthropogenic stressors. These services are primarily regulated by the activity of the soil microbiome. To understand how environmental changes may affect this vital part of the ecosystem, it is key to understand the patterns that drive microbial community assembly in mangrove forest soils. High-throughput amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA) was applied on samples from arid Avicennia marina forests across different spatial scales from local to regional. Alongside conventional analyses of community ecology, microbial co-occurrence networks were assessed to investigate differences in composition and structure of the bacterial community. The bacterial community composition varied more strongly along an intertidal gradient within each mangrove forest, than between forests in different geographic regions (Australia/Saudi Arabia). In contrast, co-occurrence networks differed primarily between geographic regions, illustrating that the structure of the bacterial community is not necessarily linked to its composition. The local diversity in mangrove forest soils may have important implications for the quantification of biogeochemical processes and is important to consider when planning restoration activities. IMPORTANCE Mangrove ecosystems are increasingly being recognized for their potential to sequester atmospheric carbon, thereby mitigating the effects of anthropogenically driven greenhouse gas emissions. The bacterial community in the soils plays an important role in the breakdown and recycling of carbon and other nutrients. To assess and predict changes in carbon storage, it is important to understand how the bacterial community is shaped by its environment. Here, we compared the bacterial communities of mangrove forests on different spatial scales, from local within-forest to biogeographic comparisons. The bacterial community composition differed more between distinct intertidal zones of the same forest than between forests in distant geographic regions. The calculated network structure of theoretically interacting bacteria, however, differed most between the geographic regions. Our findings highlight the importance of local environmental factors in shaping the microbial soil community in mangroves and highlight a disconnect between community composition and structure in microbial soil assemblages.

## Endophytic Microbiota of Rice and Their Collective Impact on Host Fitness.
 05.01.2022, _SK Jana, MM Islam, S Mandal_


Endophytic microbiota mainly includes positive modulator of plant growth, productivity, stress tolerance and ability to control the phytopathogens. Rice endophytes colonize in different parts like roots, shoots, leaves, seeds, flowers, ovules, etc. The diversity and colonization of endophytes depend on several factors like host specificity, environment specificity, chemotaxis, motility, etc. A mutualistic relationship between rice plant and their endophytes improves the host health. Several crucial activities of rice plants are influenced by the presence of endophytes as they endorse plant growth by producing different phytohormones, solubilized minerals, or mitigating various environmental adverse conditions. Endophytes also protect rice plants from various phytopathogen by the production of secondary metabolites, lytic enzymes, antibiotics and induced systemic acquired resistance. Furthermore, the endophytes from rice and major crops are recently been shown useful in environmental waste management and also for the synthesis of green nanoparticles. This study highlights the beneficial interaction between rice plants and their endophytic microbiota with special emphasis on highlighting their application for sustainable agricultural and environmental practices in order to enhance the agro-economy in an eco-friendly manner.

## Spaceflight Virology: What Do We Know about Viral Threats in the Spaceflight Environment?
 04.01.2022, _B PavletiÄ‡, K Runzheimer, K Siems, S Koch, M CortesÃ£o, A Ramos-Nascimento, R Moeller_


Viruses constitute a significant part of the human microbiome, so wherever humans go, viruses are brought with them, even on space missions. In this mini review, we focus on the International Space Station (ISS) as the only current human habitat in space that has a diverse range of viral genera that infect microorganisms from bacteria to eukaryotes. Thus, we have reviewed the literature on the physical conditions of space habitats that have an impact on both virus transmissibility and interaction with their host, which include UV radiation, ionizing radiation, humidity, and microgravity. Also, we briefly comment on the practices used on space missions that reduce virus spread, that is, use of antimicrobial surfaces, spacecraft sterilization practices, and air filtration. Finally, we turn our attention to the health threats that viruses pose to space travel. Overall, even though efforts are taken to ensure safe conditions during human space travel, for example, preflight quarantines of astronauts, we reflect on the potential risks humans might be exposed to and how those risks might be aggravated in extraterrestrial habitats.

## Cell-Free Paper-Based Analysis of Gut Microbiota and Host Biomarkers.
 05.01.2022, _MK Takahashi, X Tan, AJ Dy_


The gut microbiome and its interactions with the host have been shown to affect several aspects of human health and disease. Investigations to elucidate these mechanisms typically involve sequence analysis of fecal samples. To support these studies, we present methods to design RNA toehold switch sensors to detect microbial and host transcripts. The sensors are embedded in paper-based, cell-free reactions that enable affordable and rapid analysis of microbiome samples.

## CACONET: a novel classification framework for microbial correlation networks.
 04.01.2022, _Y Xu, K Nash, A Acharjee, GV Gkoutos_


Existing microbiome-based disease prediction relies on the ability of machine learning methods to differentiate disease from healthy subjects based on the observed taxa abundance across samples. Despite numerous microbes have been implicated as potential biomarkers, challenges remain due to not only the statistical nature of microbiome data, but also the lack of understanding of microbial interactions which can be indicative of the disease.
