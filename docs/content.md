## The Gut-Lung Axis in Cystic Fibrosis.
 02.08.2021, _CE Price, GA O'Toole_


Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a heritable, multi-organ disease that impacts all tissues that normally express CFTR protein. While importance of the airway microbiota has long been recognized, the intestinal microbiota has only recently been recognized as an important player in both intestinal and lung health outcomes for persons with CF (pwCF). Here, we summarize current literature related to the gut-lung axis in CF, with a particular focus on three key ideas: Mechanisms through which microbes influence the gut-lung axis, drivers of microbiota alterations, and the potential for intestinal microbiota remediation.

Interactions between diet and gut microbiota are critical regulators of energy metabolism. The effects of fibre intake have been deeply studied but little is known about the impact of proteins. Here, we investigated the effects of high protein supplementation (Investigational Product, IP) in a double blind, randomised placebo-controled intervention study (NCT01755104) where 107 participants received the IP or an isocaloric normoproteic comparator (CP) alongside a mild caloric restriction. Gut microbiota profiles were explored in a patient subset (n = 53) using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Visceral fat decreased in both groups (IP group: - 20.8 ± 23.2 cm2; CP group: - 14.5 ± 24.3 cm2) with a greater reduction (p &lt; 0.05) with the IP supplementation in the Per Protocol population. Microbial diversity increased in individuals with a baseline low gene count (p &lt; 0.05). The decrease in weight, fat mass and visceral fat mass significantly correlated with the increase in microbial diversity (p &lt; 0.05). Protein supplementation had little effects on bacteria composition but major differences were seen at functional level. Protein supplementation stimulated bacterial amino acid metabolism (90% amino-acid synthesis functions enriched with IP versus 13% in CP group (p &lt; 0.01)). Protein supplementation alongside a mild energy restriction induces visceral fat mass loss and an activation of gut microbiota amino-acid metabolism.Clinical trial registration: NCT01755104 (24/12/2012). https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT01755104?term=NCT01755104&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1 .

## Metabolic Features of Ganjang (a Korean Traditional Soy Sauce) Fermentation Revealed by Genome-Centered Metatranscriptomics.
 03.08.2021, _BH Chun, DM Han, HM Kim, D Park, DM Jeong, HA Kang, CO Jeon_


The taste and quality of soy sauce, a fermented liquid condiment popular worldwide, is greatly influenced by microbial metabolism during fermentation. To investigate the fermentative features of ganjang (a Korean traditional soy sauce), ganjang batches using meju (fermented soybean) bricks and solar salts were prepared, and organic compounds, microbial communities, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes of ganjang were quantitively analyzed during fermentation. Polymeric compound analysis in the ganjang treated with/without microbial inhibitors revealed that indigenous enzymes of meju bricks might be primarily responsible for degrading polymeric compounds. Through metagenome binning and microbe sequencing, 17 high-quality genome sequences representing all major ganjang microbiota were obtained, and their transcriptional expressions were quantitatively analyzed by mapping metatranscriptome reads normalized by spike-in RNA sequencing to the 17 genomes, which revealed that microbial metabolism might primarily occur while meju bricks are in the ganjang solution and decrease significantly after the removal of meju bricks. Metabolic pathways for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids of the major ganjang microbiota were reconstructed, and their metabolic genes were transcriptionally analyzed, revealing that facultative lactic acid fermentation by Tetragenococcus was the major fermentation process active in the ganjang fermentation and that aerobic respiration by facultatively aerobic bacteria such as Chromohalobacter, Halomonas, and Marinobacter was also an important metabolic process during fermentation. Although the abundances of Fungi and the corresponding transcriptional expression levels were generally much lower than those of Bacteria, our analysis suggests that yeasts such as Debaryomyces and Wickerhamomyces might be in large part responsible for producing biogenic amines and flavors. IMPORTANCE The taste and quality of soy sauce, a popular fermented liquid condiment worldwide, is greatly influenced by microbial metabolism during fermentation. Spontaneous fermentation of ganjang (a Korean traditional soy sauce) in a nonsterile environment leads to the growth of diverse bacteria and fungi during fermentation, making it difficult to understand the mechanism of ganjang fermentation. Genome-centered metatranscriptomic analysis, combined with organic compound analysis, quantitative metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses, and metabolic pathway reconstruction and expressional analysis of the major ganjang microbiota during fermentation, would provide comprehensive insights into the metabolic features of ganjang fermentation.

## Contrasting heat stress response patterns of coral holobionts across the Red Sea suggest distinct mechanisms of thermal tolerance.
 03.08.2021, _CR Voolstra, JJ Valenzuela, S Turkarslan, A Cárdenas, BCC Hume, G Perna, C Buitrago-López, K Rowe, MV Orellana, NS Baliga, S Paranjape, G Banc-Prandi, J Bellworthy, M Fine, S Frias-Torres, DJ Barshis_


Corals from the northern Red Sea, in particular the Gulf of Aqaba (GoA), have exceptionally high bleaching thresholds approaching &gt;5℃ above their maximum monthly mean (MMM) temperatures. These elevated thresholds are thought to be due to historical selection, as corals passed through the warmer Southern Red Sea during recolonization from the Arabian Sea. To test this hypothesis, we determined thermal tolerance thresholds of GoA versus central Red Sea (CRS) Stylophora pistillata corals using multi-temperature acute thermal stress assays to determine thermal thresholds. Relative thermal thresholds of GoA and CRS corals were indeed similar and exceptionally high (~7℃ above MMM). However, absolute thermal thresholds of CRS corals were on average 3℃ above those of GoA corals. To explore the molecular underpinnings, we determined gene expression and microbiome response of the coral holobiont. Transcriptomic responses differed markedly, with a strong response to the thermal stress in GoA corals and their symbiotic algae versus a remarkably muted response in CRS colonies. Concomitant to this, coral and algal genes showed temperature-induced expression in GoA corals, while exhibiting fixed high expression (front-loading) in CRS corals. Bacterial community composition of GoA corals changed dramatically under heat stress, whereas CRS corals displayed stable assemblages. We interpret the response of GoA corals as that of a resilient population approaching a tipping point in contrast to a pattern of consistently elevated thermal resistance in CRS corals that cannot further attune. Such response differences suggest distinct thermal tolerance mechanisms that may affect the response of coral populations to ocean warming.

## Site and Organ-Specific Culture-Dependent Endophytic Diversity of Crocus sativus L. (Saffron) in Kashmir Himalaya, India.
 03.08.2021, _B Jan, ZA Reshi, FA Mohiddin_


The endophytic diversity of a host plant has been shown to vary across various spatio-temporal scales and between different organs of a plant, but no such study has been carried out on the economically important plant Crocus sativus (saffron). To fill this knowledge gap, the present study was undertaken to document the diversity of culturable bacterial, actinomycete and fungal endophytes at multiple sites from vegetative and reproductive organs of C. sativus. A total of 1170 culturable endophytic isolates were recovered from 6480 tissue segments of C. sativus collected from six different study sites in Pampore region of Kashmir valley in India. These isolates were identified using 16S and ITS (internal transcribed spacer) rDNA barcode sequence analysis and were classified into 84 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), including 52 bacterial OTUs, 7 actinomycete OTUs and 25 fungal OTUs. The phylogenetic analysis of sequences separated them into four phyla, namely, Firmicutes (46%), Ascomycota (30%), Proteobacteria (16%) and Actinobacteria (8%). Significant differences were observed in the diversity of endophytic assemblages across various study sites and different plant organs (P ≤ 0.001). Species richness was highest at the Baroosa site and lowest at the Chandhar site while the Shannon index was highest at the Baroosa site and lowest at the Letpur site. Among organs, species richness was highest in stigma and lowest in leaf. Similarly, Shannon index was highest for root and lowest for leaf. Further, 15 culturable endophytic OTUs showed organ specificity. The present study is the first comprehensive report that not only brings out differences in the diversity of endophytes associated with different organs and at different sites but also highlights the complexity of host-endophyte interaction at multiple scales.

## Biodegradation of metoprolol in oxic and anoxic hyporheic zone sediments: unexpected effects on microbial communities.
 02.08.2021, _C Rutere, M Posselt, A Ho, MA Horn_


Metoprolol is widely used as a beta-blocker and considered an emerging contaminant of environmental concern due to pseudo persistence in wastewater effluents that poses a potential ecotoxicological threat to aquatic ecosystems. Microbial removal of metoprolol in the redox-delineated hyporheic zone (HZ) was investigated using streambed sediments supplemented with 15 or 150 μM metoprolol in a laboratory microcosm incubation under oxic and anoxic conditions. Metoprolol disappeared from the aqueous phase under oxic and anoxic conditions within 65 and 72 days, respectively. Metoprolol was refed twice after initial depletion resulting in accelerated disappearance under both conditions. Metoprolol disappearance was marginal in sterile control microcosms with autoclaved sediment. Metoprolol was transformed mainly to metoprolol acid in oxic microcosms, while metoprolol acid and α-hydroxymetoprolol were formed in anoxic microcosms. Transformation products were transient and disappeared within 30 days under both conditions. Effects of metoprolol on the HZ bacterial community were evaluated using DNA- and RNA-based time-resolved amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA, respectively, and were prominent on 16S rRNA rather than 16S rRNA gene level suggesting moderate metoprolol-induced activity-level changes. A positive impact of metoprolol on Sphingomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae under oxic and anoxic conditions, respectively, was observed. Nitrifiers were impaired by metoprolol under oxic and anoxic conditions. Collectively, our findings revealed high metoprolol biodegradation potentials in the hyporheic zone under contrasting redox conditions associated with changes in the active microbial communities, thus contributing to the attenuation of micropollutants. KEY POINTS: • High biotic oxic and anoxic metoprolol degradation potentials in the hyporheic zone. • Key metoprolol-associated taxa included Sphingomonadaceae, Enterobacteraceae, and Promicromonosporaceae. • Negative impact of metoprolol on nitrifiers.

## Microbial assemblages and methanogenesis pathways impact methane production and foaming in manure deep-pit storages.
 03.08.2021, _F Yang, DS Andersen, S Trabue, AD Kent, LM Pepple, RS Gates, AS Howe_


Foam accumulation in swine manure deep-pits has been linked to explosions and flash fires that pose devastating threats to humans and livestock. It is clear that methane accumulation within these pits is the fuel for the fire; it is not understood what microbial drivers cause the accumulation and stabilization of methane. Here, we conducted a 13-month field study to survey the physical, chemical, and biological changes of pit-manure across 46 farms in Iowa. Our results showed that an increased methane production rate was associated with less digestible feed ingredients, suggesting that diet influences the storage pit's microbiome. Targeted sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA and archaeal mcrA genes was used to identify microbial communities' role and influence. We found that microbial communities in foaming and non-foaming manure were significantly different, and that the bacterial communities of foaming manure were more stable than those of non-foaming manure. Foaming manure methanogen communities were enriched with uncharacterized methanogens whose presence strongly correlated with high methane production rates. We also observed strong correlations between feed ration, manure characteristics, and the relative abundance of specific taxa, suggesting that manure foaming is linked to microbial community assemblage driven by efficient free long-chain fatty acid degradation by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis.
