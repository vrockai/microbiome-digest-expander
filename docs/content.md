## The dynamic wound microbiome.
 27.11.2020, _C Liu, AJ Ponsero, DG Armstrong, BA Lipsky, BL Hurwitz_


Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) account for the majority of all limb amputations and hospitalizations due to diabetes complications. With 30 million cases of diabetes in the USA and 500,000 new diagnoses each year, DFUs are a growing health problem. Diabetes patients with limb amputations have high postoperative mortality, a high rate of secondary amputation, prolonged inpatient hospital stays, and a high incidence of re-hospitalization. DFU-associated amputations constitute a significant burden on healthcare resources that cost more than 10 billion dollars per year. Currently, there is no way to identify wounds that will heal versus those that will become severely infected and require amputation.

## Vaginal Microbiota and Cytokine Microenvironment in HPV Clearance/Persistence in Women Surgically Treated for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia: An Observational Prospective Study.
 30.11.2020, _E Caselli, M D'Accolti, E Santi, I Soffritti, S Conzadori, S Mazzacane, P Greco, C Contini, G Bonaccorsi_


High-risk human papillomaviruses (hrHPVs) are causally related to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and subsequent cervical cancer (CC). The vaginal microbiome has been suggested to play a role in the development of CC, but the effect of conservative surgical treatment on the microbiome and hrHPV elimination has not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to characterize the vaginal microbiome and inflammatory chemokine profile in 85 women treated for CIN2-CIN3 lesions, before and after surgical CIN removal. The results showed, as expected, a high prevalence of dysbiotic microbiomes and vaginal pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CIN cohort, correlated with disease severity, at the basal level. By contrast, surgical CIN removal induced significant vaginal microbiome variations, and specific microbiome/cytokine profiles were associated with hrHPV clearance/persistence at 6-month follow-up. hrHPV-cleared patients, in fact, showed a specific increase of L. crispatus and decrease of dysbiosis and inflammatory cytokines compared to hrHPV-persistent patients. These data highlight the crosstalk between HPV and the local microbiome, and suggest that vaginal microbiome modulation might represent a novel approach to modifying the natural history of hrHPV-related CC.

## The impact of maternal obesity on childhood neurodevelopment.
 30.11.2020, _L Tong, BT Kalish_


There is growing clinical and experimental evidence to suggest that maternal obesity increases children's susceptibility to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Given the worldwide obesity epidemic, it is crucial that we acquire a thorough understanding of the available evidence, identify gaps in knowledge, and develop an agenda for intervention. This review synthesizes human and animal studies investigating the association between maternal obesity and offspring brain health. It also highlights key mechanisms underlying these effects, including maternal and fetal inflammation, alterations to the microbiome, epigenetic modifications of neurotrophic genes, and impaired dopaminergic and serotonergic signaling. Lastly, this review highlights several proposed interventions and priorities for future investigation.

## Microbiomics: Were we all wrong before?
 23.11.2020, _PS Kumar_


Periodontal microbiology has historically been based on an "us against them" paradigm, one that focuses mainly on identifying microbes and viruses that cause disease. However, such a bottom-up approach limits our appreciation of the incredible diversity of this ecosystem and the essential ways in which microbial interactions contribute to health and homeostasis of the subgingival niche. Microbiomics-the science of collectively characterizing and quantifying molecules responsible for the structure, function, and dynamics of a microbial community-has enabled us to study these communities in their natural habitat, thereby revolutionizing our knowledge of host-associated microbes and reconceptualizing our definition of "human." When this systems-biology approach is combined with ecologic principles, it explicates the complex relationship that exist between microbiota and between them and us, the human. In this volume of Periodontology 2000, a group of 12 female scientists take the lead in investigating how metagenomics, genomics, metatranscriptomics, proteomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics have achieved the following: (a) widened our view of the periodontal microbiome; (b) expanded our understanding of the evolution of the human oral microbiome; (c) shone a light on not just bacteria, but also other prokaryotic and eukaryotic members of the community; (d) elucidated the effects of anthropogenic behavior and systemic diseases on shaping these communities; and (e) influenced traditional patterns of periodontal therapeutics.

## Metaproteome and metabolome of oral microbial communities.
 23.11.2020, _N Bostanci, M Grant, K Bao, A Silbereisen, F Hetrodt, D Manoil, GN Belibasakis_


The emergence of high-throughput technologies for the comprehensive measurement of biomolecules, also referred to as "omics" technologies, has helped us gather "big data" and characterize microbial communities. In this article, we focus on metaproteomic and metabolomic approaches that support hypothesis-driven investigations on various oral biologic samples. Proteomics reveals the working units of the oral milieu and metabolomics unveils the reactions taking place; and so these complementary techniques can unravel the functionality and underlying regulatory processes within various oral microbial communities. Current knowledge of the proteomic interplay and metabolic interactions of microorganisms within oral biofilm and salivary microbiome communities is presented and discussed, from both clinical and basic research perspectives. Communities indicative of, or from, health, caries, periodontal diseases, and endodontic lesions are represented. Challenges, future prospects, and examples of best practice are given.

## Gutmicrobiota, immunity and pain.
 28.11.2020, _M Santoni, F Miccini, N Battelli_


The interplay between microbiota and nervous system has been associated with a variety of diseases, including stress, anxiety, depression and cognition. The growing body of evidences on the essential role of gut microbiota in modulating acute and chronic pain has opened a new frontier for pain management. Gut microbiota is involved in the development of visceral, inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Bacterial alterations due to chronic opioid administration have been directly related to the development of drug tolerance, which can be potentially restored by the use of probiotics and antibiotics. In this review we describe the mechanisms underlying the brain/gut axis and the relationship between gut microbiota, immunity and pain.

## The Healthy Microbiome (What is the definition of a healthy gut microbiome?).
 30.11.2020, _F Shanahan, TS Ghosh, PW O'Toole_


Use of microbiome-based biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis, risk profiling, and precision therapy requires definition of a healthy microbiome in different populations. To determine features of the intestinal microbiota associated with health, however, we need improved microbiome profiling technologies, with strain-level resolution. We must also learn more about how the microbiome varies among apparently healthy people, how it changes with age, and the effects of diet, medications, ethnicity, geography, and lifestyle. Furthermore, many intestinal microbes, including viruses, phage, fungi, and archaea, have not been characterized, and little is known about their contributions to health and disease.Whether a healthy microbiome can be defined is an important and seemingly simple question, but with a complex answer in continual need of refinement.

## Altered gut bacterial and metabolic signatures and their interaction in gestational diabetes mellitus.
 23.11.2020, _X Wang, H Liu, Y Li, S Huang, L Zhang, C Cao, PN Baker, C Tong, P Zheng, H Qi_


Emerging evidence indicates that the gut microbiome can modulate metabolic homeostasis, and thus may influence the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, whether and how the gut microbiome and its correlated metabolites change in GDM is uncertain. Herein we compare the gut microbial compositions, and fecal and urine metabolomes, of 59 patients with GDM versus 48 pregnant healthy controls (HCs). We showed that the microbial and metabolic signatures of GDM patients were significantly different from those of HCs. Compared to HCs, the GDM subjects were characterized by enriched bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the family Lachnospiraceae, and depleted OTUs of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae. Some altered gut microbes were significantly correlated with glucose values and fetal ultrasonography indexes. Moreover, we identified four fecal and 15 urine metabolites that discriminate GDM from HC. These differential metabolites are mainly involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Significantly, co-occurrence network analysis revealed that Lachnospiraceae and Enterobacteriaceae bacterial OTUs formed strong co-occurring relationships with metabolites involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, suggesting that disturbed gut microbiome may mediate GDM. Furthermore, we identified a novel combinatorial marker panel that could distinguish GDM from HC subjects with high accuracy. Together our findings demonstrate that altered microbial composition and metabolic function may be relevant to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of GDM.

## Wild black bears harbor simple gut microbial communities with little difference between the jejunum and colon.
 30.11.2020, _SJ Gillman, EA McKenney, DJR Lafferty_


The gut microbiome (GMB), comprising the commensal microbial communities located in the gastrointestinal tract, has co-evolved in mammals to perform countless micro-ecosystem services to facilitate physiological functions. Because of the complex inter-relationship between mammals and their gut microbes, the number of studies addressing the role of the GMB on mammalian health is almost exclusively limited to human studies and model organisms. Furthermore, much of our knowledge of wildlife-GMB relationships is based on studies of colonic GMB communities derived from the feces of captive specimens, leaving our understanding of the GMB in wildlife limited. To better understand wildlife-GMB relationships, we engaged hunters as citizen scientists to collect biological samples from legally harvested black bears (Ursus americanus) and used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize wild black bear GMB communities in the colon and jejunum, two functionally distinct regions of the gastrointestinal tract. We determined that the jejunum and colon of black bears do not harbor significantly different GMB communities: both gastrointestinal sites were dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. However, a number of bacteria were differentially enriched in each site, with the colon harboring twice as many enriched taxa, primarily from closely related lineages.

## Age Patterning in Wild Chimpanzee Gut Microbiota Diversity Reveals Differences from Humans in Early Life.
 24.11.2020, _AT Reese, SR Phillips, LA Owens, EM Venable, KE Langergraber, ZP Machanda, JC Mitani, MN Muller, DP Watts, RW Wrangham, TL Goldberg, M Emery Thompson, RN Carmody_


Survival in primates is facilitated by commensal gut microbes that ferment otherwise indigestible plant matter, resist colonization by pathogens, and train the developing immune system.1,2 However, humans are unique among primates in that we consume highly digestible foods, wean early, mature slowly, and exhibit high lifelong investments in maintenance.3-6 These adaptations suggest that lifetime trajectories of human-microbial relationships could differ from those of our closest living relatives. Here, we profile the gut microbiota of 166 wild chimpanzees aged 8 months to 67 years in the Kibale National Park, Uganda and compare the patterns of gut microbial maturation to those previously observed in humans. We found that chimpanzee gut microbial alpha-diversity, composition, density, interindividual variation, and within-individual change over time varied significantly with age. Notably, gut microbial signatures in infants &lt;2 years old were distinct across all five metrics. Infant chimpanzee guts were enriched in some of the same taxa prevalent in infant humans (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Streptococcus, and Bacteroides), and chimpanzee gut microbial communities, like those of humans, exhibited higher interindividual variation in infancy versus later in life. However, in direct contrast to human infants, chimpanzee infants harbored surprisingly high-diversity rather than low-diversity gut bacterial communities compared with older conspecifics. These data indicate differential trajectories of gut microbiota development in humans and chimpanzees that are consistent with interspecific differences in lactation, diet, and immune function. Probing the phenotypic consequences of differential early-life gut microbial diversity in chimpanzees and other primates will illuminate the life history impacts of the hominid-microbiome partnership.

## Genetic selection for growth drives differences in intestinal microbiota composition and parasite disease resistance in gilthead sea bream.
 26.11.2020, _MC Piazzon, F Naya-Català, E Perera, O Palenzuela, A Sitjà-Bobadilla, J Pérez-Sánchez_


The key effects of intestinal microbiota in animal health have led to an increasing interest in manipulating these bacterial populations to improve animal welfare. The aquaculture sector is no exception and in the last years, many studies have described these populations in different fish species. However, this is not an easy task, as intestinal microbiota is composed of very dynamic populations that are influenced by different factors, such as diet, environment, host age, and genetics. In the current study, we aimed to determine whether the genetic background of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) influences the intestinal microbial composition, how these bacterial populations are modulated by dietary changes, and the effect of selection by growth on intestinal disease resistance. To that aim, three different groups of five families of gilthead sea bream that were selected during two generations for fast, intermediate, or slow growth (F3 generation) were kept together in the same open-flow tanks and fed a control or a well-balanced plant-based diet during 9 months. Six animals per family and dietary treatment were sacrificed and the adherent bacteria from the anterior intestinal portion were sequenced. In parallel, fish of the fast- and slow-growth groups were infected with the intestinal parasite Enteromyxum leei and the disease signs, prevalence, intensity, and parasite abundance were evaluated.

## Beyond the extremes: Rocks as ultimate refuge for fungi in drylands.
 24.11.2020, _C Coleine, JE Stajich, A de Los Ríos, L Selbmann_


In an era of rapid climate change and expansion of desertification, the extremely harsh conditions of drylands are a true challenge for microbial life. Under drought conditions, where most life forms cannot survive, rocks represent the main refuge for life. Indeed, the endolithic habitat provides thermal buffering, physical stability, and protection against incident ultraviolet (UV) radiation and solar radiation and, to some extent, ensures water retention to microorganisms. The study of these highly specialized extreme-tolerant and extremophiles may provide tools for understanding microbial interactions and processes that allow them to keep their metabolic machinery active under conditions of dryness and oligotrophy that are typically incompatible with active life, up to the dry limits for life. Despite lithobiontic communities being studied all over the world, a comprehensive understanding of their ecology, evolution, and adaptation is still nascent. Herein, we survey the fungal component of these microbial ecosystems. We first provide an overview of the main defined groups (i.e., lichen-forming fungi, black fungi, and yeasts) of the most known and studied Antarctic endolithic communities that are almost the only life forms ensuring ecosystem functionality in the ice-free areas of the continent. For each group, we discuss their main traits and their diversity. Then, we focus on the fungal taxonomy and ecology of other worldwide endolithic communities. Finally, we highlight the utmost importance of a global rock survey in order to have a comprehensive view of the diversity, distribution, and functionality of these fungi in drylands, to obtain tools in desert area management, and as early alarm systems to climate change.

## Emerging computational tools and models for studying gut microbiota composition and function.
 28.11.2020, _SY Park, A Ufondu, K Lee, A Jayaraman_


The gut microbiota and its metabolites play critical roles in human health and disease. Advances in high-throughput sequencing, mass spectrometry, and other omics assay platforms have improved our ability to generate large volumes of data exploring the temporal variations in the compositions and functions of microbial communities. To elucidate mechanisms, methods and tools are needed that can rigorously model the dependencies within time-series data. Longitudinal data are often sparse and unevenly sampled, and nontrivial challenges remain in determining statistical significance, normalization across different data types, and model validation. In this review, we highlight recent developments in models and software tools for the analysis of time series microbiome and metabolome data, as well as integration of these data.
