## Co-evolution and Co-speciation of Host-Gut Bacteria Systems.
 09.07.2020, _M Groussin, F Mazel, EJ Alm_


Mammalian gut microbiomes profoundly influence host fitness, but the processes that drive the evolution of host-microbiome systems are poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that mammals and their individual gut symbionts can have parallel evolutionary histories, as represented by their congruent phylogenies. These "co-phylogenetic" patterns are signatures of ancient co-speciation events and illustrate the cohesiveness of the mammalian host-gut microbiome entity over evolutionary times. Theory predicts that co-speciation between mammals and their gut symbionts could result from their co-evolution. However, there is only limited evidence of such co-evolution. Here, we propose a model that explains cophylogenetic patterns without relying on co-evolution. Specifically, we suggest that individual gut bacteria are likely to diverge in patterns recapitulating host phylogeny when hosts undergo allopatric speciation, limiting inter-host bacterial dispersal and genomic recombination. We provide evidence that the model is empirically grounded and propose a series of observational and experimental approaches to test its validity.

## Fecal Microbiota Transplantation is Safe and Effective in Patients with Clostridioides difficile Infection and Cirrhosis.
 09.07.2020, _YW Cheng, D Alhaffar, S Saha, S Khanna, M Bohm, E Phelps, M Ghabril, E Orman, S Sashidhar, N Rogers, H Xu, A Khoruts, B Vaughn, D Kao, K Wong, G Cammarota, G Ianiro, T Dhere, CS Kraft, N Mehta, H Michael Woodworth, JR Allegretti, L Nativ, J Marcus, N El-Nachef, M Fischer_


Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) harms a large proportion of patients with cirrhosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for recurrent CDI, but its effects in patients with cirrhosis have not been established. We performed a multicenter, observational study to evaluate efficacy and safety of FMT for CDI in patients with cirrhosis.

## The duodenal microbiome is altered in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
 09.07.2020, _G Leite, W Morales, S Weitsman, S Celly, G Parodi, R Mathur, GM Barlow, R Sedighi, MJV Millan, A Rezaie, M Pimentel_


Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is highly prevalent and is associated with numerous gastrointestinal disorders, but the microbes involved remain poorly defined. Moreover, existing studies of microbiome alterations in SIBO have utilized stool samples, which are not representative of the entire gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we aimed to determine and compare the duodenal microbiome composition in SIBO and non-SIBO subjects, using duodenal aspirates from subjects undergoing standard-of-care esophagogastroduodenoscopy without colon preparation. Using the recently-redefined cutoff for SIBO of &gt;103 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), 42 SIBO and 98 non-SIBO subjects were identified. Duodenal samples from SIBO subjects had 4x103-fold higher counts than non-SIBO subjects when plated on MacConkey agar (P&lt;0.0001), and 3.8-fold higher counts when plated on blood agar (P&lt;0.0001). Twenty subjects had also undergone lactulose hydrogen breath tests (LHBTs), of whom 7/20 had SIBO. At the 90-minute timepoint, 4/7 SIBO subjects had positive LHBTs (rise in hydrogen (H2) ≥ 20 ppm above baseline), as compared to 2/13 non-SIBO subjects. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing revealed that SIBO subjects had 4.31-fold higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria (FDR P&lt;0.0001) and 1.64-fold lower Firmicutes (P&lt;0.0003) than non-SIBO subjects. This increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria correlated with decreased α-diversity in SIBO subjects (Spearman R = 0.4866, P&lt;0.0001) Specific increases in class Gammaproteobacteria correlated with the area-under-the-curve for H2 for 0-90 mins during LHBT (R = 0.630, P = 0.002). Increases in Gammaproteobacteria resulted primarily from higher relative abundances of the family Enterobacteriaceae (FDR P&lt;0.0001), which correlated with the symptom of bloating (Spearman R = 0.185, 2-tailed P = 0.028). Increases in family Aeromonadaceae correlated with urgency with bowel movement (Spearman R = 0.186, 2-tailed P = 0.028). These results validate the &gt;103 CFU/mL cutoff for the definition of SIBO, and also reveal specific overgrowth of Proteobacteria in SIBO vs. non-SIBO subjects, coupled with an altered Proteobacterial profile that correlates with symptom severity. Future research may elucidate host-microbiome interactions underlying these symptoms in SIBO patients.

## Faecal microbiota transplantation: A life-saving therapy challenged by commercial claims for exclusivity.
 09.07.2020, _CL Hvas, SMD Baunwall, C Erikstrup_


Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an innovative treatment which is challenged by a regulatory struggle in Europe. A recent publication in EClinicalMedicine describes the successful adaptation of FMT to a National drug legislation, but this approach fails to take into account the donor-related aspects. The European tissue and cells directive and affiliated technical guide provide extensive safety and quality standards which may readily be adopted in an FMT service to provide patients with this life-saving treatment embedded in a public blood centre.
