At the entry site of respiratory virus infections, the oropharyngeal microbiome has been proposed as a major hub integrating viral and host immune signals. Early studies suggested that infections with Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are associated with changes of the upper and lower airway microbiome, and that specific microbial signatures may predict COVID-19 illness. However, the results are not conclusive, as critical illness can drastically alter a patient's microbiome through multiple confounders.

## The Role of Microbiota in Infant Health: From Early Life to Adulthood.
 26.10.2021, _Y Yao, X Cai, Y Ye, F Wang, F Chen, C Zheng_


From early life to adulthood, the microbiota play a crucial role in the health of the infant. The microbiota in early life are not only a key regulator of infant health but also associated with long-term health. Pregnancy to early life is the golden time for the establishment of the infant microbiota, which is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Recently, there is an explosion of the studies on the role of microbiota in human diseases, but the application to disease or health is relatively limited because many aspects of human microbiota remain controversial, especially about the infant microbiota. Therefore, a critical and conclusive review is necessary to understand fully the relationship between the microbiota and the health of infant. In this article, we introduce in detail the role of microbiota in the infant from pregnancy to early life to long-term health. The main contents of this article include the relationship between the maternal microbiota and adverse pregnancy outcomes, the establishment of the neonatal microbiota during perinatal period and early life, the composition of the infant gut microbiota, the prediction of the microbiota for long-term health, and the future study directions of microbiota.

## The microbiome impacts host hybridization and speciation.
 26.10.2021, _AK Miller, CS Westlake, KL Cross, BA Leigh, SR Bordenstein_


Microbial symbiosis and speciation profoundly shape the composition of life's biodiversity. Despite the enormous contributions of these two fields to the foundations of modern biology, there is a vast and exciting frontier ahead for research, literature, and conferences to address the neglected prospects of merging their study. Here, we survey and synthesize exemplar cases of how endosymbionts and microbial communities affect animal hybridization and vice versa. We conclude that though the number of case studies remain nascent, the wide-ranging types of animals, microbes, and isolation barriers impacted by hybridization will likely prove general and a major new phase of study that includes the microbiome as part of the functional whole contributing to reproductive isolation. Though microorganisms were proposed to impact animal speciation a century ago, the weight of the evidence supporting this view has now reached a tipping point.

## Gut Dysbiosis, Bacterial Colonization and Translocation, and Neonatal Sepsis in Very-Low-Birth-Weight Preterm Infants.
 26.10.2021, _CC Lee, Y Feng, YM Yeh, R Lien, CL Chen, YL Zhou, CH Chiu_


Gut dysbiosis may precede neonatal sepsis, but the association is still not well-understood. The goal of this study is to investigate the association between gut microbiota and neonatal sepsis, and to seek the evidence of colonization of pathogenic bacteria in the gut before evolving into an invasive infection. A prospective cohort study examined fecal microbiota composition in preterm infants with and without sepsis. Thirty-two very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants and 10 healthy term infants as controls were enrolled. The fecal samples collected from the participants at the first, fourth, and seventh weeks of life underwent 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing for measurement of the diversity and composition of the microbiota. The bacterial isolates causing neonatal sepsis were genome sequenced. PCR was performed to confirm the translocation of the bacteria from the gut to the blood. The results showed that VLBW preterm infants with sepsis had lower microbial diversity in the gut at birth compared to preterm infants without sepsis and term infants. The composition of gut microbiome in preterm infants was similar to healthy terms at birth but evolved toward dysbiosis with increasing Proteobacteria and decreasing Firmicutes weeks later. The strain-specific PCR confirmed the presence of causative pathogens in the gut in 4 (40%) out of 10 VLBW preterms with sepsis before or at onset of sepsis, and persistence of the colonization for weeks after antibiotic treatment. The same bacterial strain could horizontally spread to cause infection in other infants. Prolonged antibiotic exposure significantly reduced beneficial Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the gut. In conclusion, preterm infants with gut dysbiosis are at risk for neonatal sepsis, and the causative pathogens may be from the gut and persist to spread horizontally. The association of increased Proteobacteria abundance and decrease in microbiome diversity suggests the need for interventions targeting the gut microbiome to prevent dysbiosis and sepsis in VLBW preterm infants.

## Oral, nasal, and gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease.
 25.10.2021, _Z Li, G Lu, E Luo, B Wu, Z Li, J Guo, Z Xia, C Zheng, Q Su, Y Zeng, W Yee Chan, X Su, X Qiu, X Zheng, Q Cai, Y Xu, Y Chen, Y Fan, W Chen, Z Yu, X Chen, C Zheng, M Wang, W Sang Poon, X Luo_


Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the link between microbiota composition in important mucosal interfaces (oral, nasal, and intestinal) and PD. Sequencing was undertaken of the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of the microbiome from the oral cavity, nasal cavity, and gut of 91 PD patients and 91 healthy controls. Significant differences were found in microbiota composition in the oral cavity and gut, but not the nasal cavity, between PD patients and healthy controls after adjusting for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). More genera in the oral cavity were significantly positively correlated with clinical characteristics, such as the HAMA and HAMD rating scales. The taxa c_Clostridia, o_Clostridiales, and f_Ruminococcaceae in the gut microbiota were associated with weight and MMSE score. Furthermore, as a result of dysbiosis, there was an enrichment of ion channel-, oxidative phosphorylation-, and carbohydrate metabolism-related pathways in the oral cavity and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis- and propanoate metabolism-related pathways in the intestine. Changes in these pathways can influence metabolism and inflammation, thereby contributing to PD pathogenesis. In addition, several subnetworks containing differentially abundant microbiota in the oral cavity and gut samples from PD patients may regulate microbial composition and function in PD. Overall, our results indicate that oral and gut dysbiosis may affect PD progression and provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of PD and identifying potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.

## Emerging cellular and molecular interactions between the lung microbiota and lung diseases.
 25.10.2021, _L Xiang, X Meng_


With the discovery of the lung microbiota, its study in both pulmonary health and disease has become a vibrant area of emerging research interest. Thus far, most studies have described the lung microbiota composition in lung disease quite well, and some of these studies indicated alterations in lung microbial communities related to the onset and development of lung disease and vice versa. However, the underlying mechanisms, particularly the cellular and molecular links, are still largely unknown. In this review, we highlight the current progress in the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the lung microbiome interacts with immune homeostasis and pulmonary disease pathogenesis to advance our understanding of the elaborate function of the lung microbiota in lung disease. We hope that this work can attract more attention to this still-young yet very promising field to facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets and provide more innovative therapies. Additional accurate standard-based methodologies and technological breakthroughs are critical to propel the field forward to ultimately achieve the goal of maintaining respiratory health.

## Drugs and Bugs: The Gut-Brain Axis and Substance Use Disorders.
 25.10.2021, _S Simpson, R Mclellan, E Wellmeyer, F Matalon, O George_


Substance use disorders (SUDs) represent a significant public health crisis. Worldwide, 5.4% of the global disease burden is attributed to SUDs and alcohol use, and many more use psychoactive substances recreationally. Often associated with comorbidities, SUDs result in changes to both brain function and physiological responses. Mounting evidence calls for a precision approach for the treatment and diagnosis of SUDs, and the gut microbiome is emerging as a contributor to such disorders. Over the last few centuries, modern lifestyles, diets, and medical care have altered the health of the microbes that live in and on our bodies; as we develop, our diets and lifestyle dictate which microbes flourish and which microbes vanish. An increase in antibiotic treatments, with many antibiotic interventions occurring early in life during the microbiome's normal development, transforms developing microbial communities. Links have been made between the microbiome and SUDs, and the microbiome and conditions that are often comorbid with SUDs such as anxiety, depression, pain, and stress. A better understanding of the mechanisms influencing behavioral changes and drug use is critical in developing novel treatments for SUDSs. Targeting the microbiome as a therapeutic and diagnostic tool is a promising avenue of exploration. This review will provide an overview of the role of the gut-brain axis in a wide range of SUDs, discuss host and microbe pathways that mediate changes in the brain's response to drugs, and the microbes and related metabolites that impact behavior and health within the gut-brain axis.

## Metagenomic analysis reveals the signature of gut microbiota associated with human chronotypes.
 25.10.2021, _S Carasso, B Fishman, LS Lask, T Shochat, N Geva-Zatorsky, E Tauber_


Patterns of diurnal activity differ substantially between individuals, with early risers and late sleepers being examples of opposite chronotypes. Growing evidence suggests that the late chronotype significantly impacts the risk of developing mood disorders, obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. Despite the vast potential of utilizing chronotype information for precision medicine, those factors that shape chronotypes remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed whether the various chronotypes are associated with different gut microbiome compositions. Using metagenomic sequencing analysis, we established a distinct signature associated with chronotype based on two bacterial genera, Alistipes (elevated in "larks") and Lachnospira (elevated in "owls"). We identified three metabolic pathways associated with the early chronotype, and linked distinct dietary patterns with different chronotypes. Our work demonstrates an association between the gut microbiome and chronotype and may represent the first step towards developing dietary interventions aimed at ameliorating the deleterious health correlates of the late chronotype.

## Microbiota instruct IL-17A-producing innate lymphoid cells to promote skin inflammation in cutaneous leishmaniasis.
 26.10.2021, _TP Singh, AM Carvalho, LA Sacramento, EA Grice, P Scott_


Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) comprise a heterogeneous population of immune cells that maintain barrier function and can initiate a protective or pathological immune response upon infection. Here we show the involvement of IL-17A-producing ILCs in microbiota-driven immunopathology in cutaneous leishmaniasis. IL-17A-producing ILCs were RORγt+ and were enriched in Leishmania major infected skin, and topical colonization with Staphylococcus epidermidis before L. major infection exacerbated the skin inflammatory responses and IL-17A-producing RORγt+ ILC accumulation without impacting type 1 immune responses. IL-17A responses in ILCs were directed by Batf3 dependent CD103+ dendritic cells and IL-23. Moreover, experiments using Rag1-/- mice established that IL-17A+ ILCs were sufficient in driving the inflammatory responses as depletion of ILCs or neutralization of IL-17A diminished the microbiota mediated immunopathology. Taken together, this study indicates that the skin microbiota promotes RORγt+ IL-17A-producing ILCs, which augment the skin inflammation in cutaneous leishmaniasis.

## Anti-inflammatory effects of purple sweet potato anthocyanin extract in DSS-induced colitis: modulation of commensal bacteria and attenuated bacterial intestinal infection.
 26.10.2021, _J Mu, J Xu, L Wang, C Chen, P Chen_


Purple sweet potato anthocyanins have been acknowledged for their beneficial effects on human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although the ability of anthocyanins in modulating the gut microbiota has been reported, the relationship between the bacteria modulated by anthocyanins and intestinal inflammation has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to ascertain whether the purple sweet potato anthocyanin extract (PSPAE) modulation of gut microbiota in the dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) induced chronic colitis mouse model could result in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protection against bacterial intestinal inflammation. Chronic colitis was induced by adding DSS in drinking water while administering the mice with PSPAE via gavage (20 mg kg-1). Effects on colon tissue damage, gut microbiota composition, tight junction protein, and cytokines were evaluated. PSPAE prevented the loss of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and inhibited the increase of Gammaproteobacteria and Helicobacter upon DSS treatment. The non-pathogenic-dependent and pathogenic-dependent microenvironments were established upon treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Both PSPAE treatment and non-pathogenic treatments modified the colonic expression of mouse tight junction proteins and maintained the architecture of the colon. However, the non-pathogenic treatment could not attenuate intestinal inflammation. Moreover, the pathogenic-dependent dysbiosis was exacerbated because of the increasing colonization of pathogens such as Helicobacter. The PSPAE exerted the modulation of gut microbiota to maintain the gut microbiome homeostasis in DSS-induced chronic colitis mice, which may help to propose a new treatment that combines efficacy and reduction of the possibility of bacterial intestinal infection.

Winter carbon loss in northern ecosystems is estimated to be greater than the average growing season carbon uptake and is primarily driven by microbial decomposers. Viruses modulate microbial carbon cycling via induced mortality and metabolic controls, but it is unknown whether viruses are active under winter conditions (anoxic and sub-freezing temperatures).

## Arabidopsis assemble distinct root-associated microbiomes through the synthesis of an array of defense metabolites.
 26.10.2021, _EN Kudjordjie, R Sapkota, M Nicolaisen_


Plant associated microbiomes are known to confer fitness advantages to the host. Understanding how plant factors including biochemical traits influence host associated microbiome assembly could facilitate the development of microbiome-mediated solutions for sustainable plant production. Here, we examined microbial community structures of a set of well-characterized Arabidopsis thaliana mutants disrupted in metabolic pathways for the production of glucosinolates, flavonoids, or a number of defense signalling molecules. A. thaliana lines were grown in a natural soil and maintained under greenhouse conditions for 4 weeks before collection of roots for bacterial and fungal community profiling. We found distinct relative abundances and diversities of bacterial and fungal communities assembled in the individual A. thaliana mutants compared to their parental lines. Bacterial and fungal genera were mostly enriched than depleted in secondary metabolite and defense signaling mutants, except for flavonoid mutations on fungi communities. Bacterial genera Azospirillum and Flavobacterium were significantly enriched in most of the glucosinolate, flavonoid and signalling mutants while the fungal taxa Sporobolomyces and Emericellopsis were enriched in several glucosinolates and signalling mutants. Whilst the present study revealed marked differences in microbiomes of Arabidopsis mutants and their parental lines, it is suggestive that unknown enzymatic and pleiotropic activities of the mutated genes could contribute to the identified host-associated microbiomes. Notwithstanding, this study revealed interesting gene-microbiota links, and thus represents valuable resource data for selecting candidate A. thaliana mutants for analyzing the links between host genetics and the associated microbiome.

## Microbiome of Pukzing Cave in India shows high antimicrobial activity against plant and animal pathogens.
 26.10.2021, _MA Iquebal, AK Passari, J Jagannadham, F Ahmad, VV Leo, G Singh, S Jaiswal, A Rai, D Kumar, BP Singh_


Pukzing cave, the largest cave of Mizoram, India was explored for bacterial diversity. Culture dependent method revealed 235 bacterial isolates using three different treatments. Identity of the microbial species was confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing. The highest bacterial population was recovered from heat treatment (n = 97;41.2%) followed by normal (n = 79;33.6%) and cold treatment (n = 59;25.1%) indicating dominance of moderate thermophiles. Antimicrobial potential of isolates showed 20.4% isolates having antimicrobial ability against tested pathogens. Amplicon sequencing of PKSI, PKSII and NRP specific genes revealed presence of AMP genes in the microbial population. Six microbial pathogens were selected for screening as they are well known for different disease cause organism in various fields such as agriculture and human health. Cave environment harbors unique microbial flora and hypervariable region V4 is more informative. Higher activity of AMP assay against these microbes indicates that cave microbial communities could be potential source of future genomic resources.

## Phyllosphere microbiome: Diversity and functions.
 26.10.2021, _I Bashir, AF War, I Rafiq, ZA Reshi, I Rashid, YS Shouche_


Phyllosphere or aerial surface of plants represents the globally largest and peculiar microbial habitat that inhabits diverse and rich communities of bacteria, fungi, viruses, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, nematodes, and protozoans. These hyperdiverse microbial communities are related to the host's specific functional traits and influence the host's physiology and the ecosystem's functioning. In the last few years, significant advances have been made in unravelling several aspects of phyllosphere microbiology, including diversity and microbial community composition, dynamics, and functional interactions. This review highlights the current knowledge about the assembly, structure, and composition of phyllosphere microbial communities across spatio-temporal scales, besides functional significance of different microbial communities to the plant host and the surrounding environment. The knowledge will help develop strategies for modelling and manipulating these highly beneficial microbial consortia for furthering scientific inquiry into their interactions with the host plants and also for their useful and economic utilization.

## Rhizospheric microbiome: Bio-based emerging strategies for sustainable agriculture development and future perspectives.
 26.10.2021, _KC Kumawat, N Razdan, K Saharan_


In the light of intensification of cropping practices and changing climatic conditions, nourishing a growing global population requires optimizing environmental sustainability and reducing ecosystem impacts of food production. The use of microbiological systems to ameliorate the agricultural production in a sustainable and eco-friendly way is widespread accepted as a future key-technology. However, the multitude of interaction possibilities between the numerous beneficial microbes and plants in their habitat calls for systematic analysis and management of the rhizospheric microbiome. This review exploits present and future strategies for rhizospheric microbiome management with the aim to generate a comprehensive understanding of the known tools and techniques. Significant information on the structure and dynamics of rhizospheric microbiota of isolated microbial communities is now available. These microbial communities have beneficial effects including increased plant growth, essential nutrient acquisition, pathogens tolerance, and increased abiotic as well as biotic stress tolerance such as drought, temperature, salinity and antagonistic activities against the phyto-pathogens. A better and comprehensive understanding of the various effects and microbial interactions can be gained by application of molecular approaches as extraction of DNA/RNA and other biochemical markers to analyze microbial soil diversity. Novel techniques like interactome network analysis and split-ubiquitin system framework will enable to gain more insight into communication and interactions between the proteins from microbes and plants. The aim of the analysis tasks leads to the novel approach of Rhizosphere microbiome engineering. The capability of forming the rhizospheric microbiome in a defined way will allow combining several microbes (e.g. bacteria and fungi) for a given environment (soil type and climatic zone) in order to exert beneficial influences on specific plants. This integration will require a large-scale effort among academic researchers, industry researchers and farmers to understand and manage interactions of plant-microbiomes within modern farming systems, and is clearly a multi-domain approach and can be mastered only jointly by microbiology, mathematics and information technology. These innovations will open up a new avenue for designing and implementing intensive farming microbiome management approaches to maximize resource productivity and stress tolerance of agro-ecosystems, which in return will create value to the increasing worldwide population, for both food production and consumption.

## The intestinal virome: lessons from animal models.
 26.10.2021, _L Chaffringeon, Q Lamy-Besnier, L Debarbieux, L De Sordi_


Mucosal surfaces in contact with the environment host specific microbiota. The intestinal tract harbours the most abundant and diverse bacterial and viral populations interacting with each other as well as with the host. Viruses of the microbiota are important components of this ecosystem, as shown by viral alterations associated with various pathologies. However, practical and ethical constraints limit functional studies of the virome in humans, making animal models invaluable experimental tools to understand its impact on intestinal physiology. In this review, we present the recent advances in the study of virome in animal models. We focus on the strategies used to characterise viral changes in disease models and approaches to modulate the microbiota using viruses. In reviewing the interplay between viruses, bacteria, and the animal host, we highlight the potential and limitations of these models in elucidating the role of the virome in determining human health and disease.

## Application of Deep Learning in Plant-Microbiota Association Analysis.
 26.10.2021, _Z Deng, J Zhang, J Li, X Zhang_


Unraveling the association between microbiome and plant phenotype can illustrate the effect of microbiome on host and then guide the agriculture management. Adequate identification of species and appropriate choice of models are two challenges in microbiome data analysis. Computational models of microbiome data could help in association analysis between the microbiome and plant host. The deep learning methods have been widely used to learn the microbiome data due to their powerful strength of handling the complex, sparse, noisy, and high-dimensional data. Here, we review the analytic strategies in the microbiome data analysis and describe the applications of deep learning models for plant-microbiome correlation studies. We also introduce the application cases of different models in plant-microbiome correlation analysis and discuss how to adapt the models on the critical steps in data processing. From the aspect of data processing manner, model structure, and operating principle, most deep learning models are suitable for the plant microbiome data analysis. The ability of feature representation and pattern recognition is the advantage of deep learning methods in modeling and interpretation for association analysis. Based on published computational experiments, the convolutional neural network and graph neural networks could be recommended for plant microbiome analysis.

## Simple solution to preserve plant samples for microbiome analyses.
 25.10.2021, _LC Carvalhais, PG Dennis, A Poudel, HWG Birt, SA Bhuiyan, SD Card, P Joyce_


Culture-independent survey techniques are fundamental tools when assessing plant microbiomes. These methods rely on DNA that is carefully preserved after collecting samples to achieve meaningful results. Immediately freezing samples to -80°C after collection is considered one of the most robust methods for preserving samples before DNA extraction but is often impractical. Preservation solutions can solve this problem, but commercially available products are expensive, and there is limited data comparing their efficacy with other preservation methods. In this study, we compared the impact of three methods of sample preservation on plant microbiome surveys: 1) RNAlater® , a proprietary preservative; 2) a home-made salt-saturated dimethyl sulfoxide preservation solution (DESS); and 3) freezing at -80°C. DESS-preserved samples, stored at room temperature for up to four weeks, did not show any significant differences to samples frozen at -80°C, while RNAlater® inflated bacterial alpha diversity. Preservation treatments did not distinctively influence fungal alpha diversity. Our results demonstrate that DESS is a versatile and inexpensive preservative of DNA in plant material for diversity analyses of fungi and bacteria.

## Novel methods of microbiome analysis in the food industry.
 23.10.2021, _C Sabater, JF Cobo-Díaz, A Álvarez-Ordóñez, P Ruas-Madiedo, L Ruiz, A Margolles_


The study of the food microbiome has gained considerable interest in recent years, mainly due to the wide range of applications that can be derived from the analysis of metagenomes. Among these applications, it is worth mentioning the possibility of using metagenomic analyses to determine food authenticity, to assess the microbiological safety of foods thanks to the detection and tracking of pathogens, antibiotic resistance genes and other undesirable traits, as well to identify the microorganisms responsible for food processing defects. Metataxonomics and metagenomics are currently the gold standard methodologies to explore the full potential of metagenomes in the food industry. However, there are still a number of challenges that must be solved in order to implement these methods routinely in food chain monitoring, and for the regulatory agencies to take them into account in their opinions. These challenges include the difficulties of analysing foods and food-related environments with a low microbial load, the lack of validated bioinformatics pipelines adapted to food microbiomes and the difficulty of assessing the viability of the detected microorganisms. This review summarizes the methods of microbiome analysis that have been used, so far, in foods and food-related environments, with a specific focus on those involving Next-Generation Sequencing technologies.
