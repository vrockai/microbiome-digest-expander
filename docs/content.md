Despite their crucial importance for human health, there is still relatively limited knowledge on how the gut resistome changes or responds to antibiotic treatment across ages, especially in the latter case. Here, we use fecal metagenomic data from 662 Danish infants and 217 young adults to fill this gap. The gut resistomes are characterized by a bimodal distribution driven by E. coli composition. The typical profile of the gut resistome differs significantly between adults and infants, with the latter distinguished by higher gene and plasmid abundances. However, the predominant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are the same. Antibiotic treatment reduces bacterial diversity and increased ARG and plasmid abundances in both cohorts, especially core ARGs. The effects of antibiotic treatments on the gut microbiome last longer in adults than in infants, and different antibiotics are associated with distinct impacts. Overall, this study broadens our current understanding of gut resistome dynamics and the impact of antibiotic treatment across age groups.

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a crippling psychiatric disorder characterized by intense fear or anxiety in social situations and their avoidance. However, the underlying biology of SAD is unclear and better treatments are needed. Recently, the gut microbiota has emerged as a key regulator of both brain and behaviour, especially those related to social function. Moreover, increasing data supports a role for immune function and oxytocin signalling in social responses. To investigate whether the gut microbiota plays a causal role in modulating behaviours relevant to SAD, we transplanted the microbiota from SAD patients, which was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing to be of a differential composition compared to healthy controls, to mice. Although the mice that received the SAD microbiota had normal behaviours across a battery of tests designed to assess depression and general anxiety-like behaviours, they had a specific heightened sensitivity to social fear, a model of SAD. This distinct heightened social fear response was coupled with changes in central and peripheral immune function and oxytocin expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. This work demonstrates an interkingdom basis for social fear responses and posits the microbiome as a potential therapeutic target for SAD.

Gut environments harbour dense microbial ecosystems in which plasmids are widely distributed. Plasmids facilitate the exchange of genetic material among microorganisms while enabling the transfer of a diverse array of accessory functions. However, their precise impact on microbial community composition and function remains largely unexplored. Here we identify a prevalent bacterial toxin and a plasmid-encoded resistance mechanism that mediates the interaction between Lactobacilli and Enterococci. This plasmid is widespread across ecosystems, including the rumen and human gut microbiota. Biochemical characterization of the plasmid revealed a defence mechanism against reuterin, a toxin produced by various gut microbes, such as Limosilactobacillus reuteri. Using a targeted metabolomic approach, we find reuterin to be prevalent across rumen ecosystems with impacts on microbial community structure. Enterococcus strains carrying the protective plasmid were isolated and their interactions with L. reuteri, the toxin producer, were studied in vitro. Interestingly, we found that by conferring resistance against reuterin, the plasmid mediates metabolic exchange between the defending and the attacking microbial species, resulting in a beneficial relationship or mutualism. Hence, we reveal here an ecological role for a plasmid-coded defence system in mediating a beneficial interaction.

## Oral microbiome-driven virulence factors: A novel approach to pancreatic cancer diagnosis.
 28.12.2023, _X Zeng, D Ren, R Liu, Q Zhang, X Yan, X Yuan_


Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, often associated with a poor prognosis for patients. One of the major challenges in managing PDAC is the difficulty in early diagnosis, owing to the limited and invasive nature of current diagnostic methods. Recent studies have identified the oral microbiome as a potential source of non-invasive biomarkers for diseases, including PDAC. In this study, we focused on leveraging the differential expression of virulence factors (VFs) encoded by the oral microbiome to create a diagnostic tool for PDAC. We observed a higher alpha diversity in VF categories among PDAC patients compared to healthy controls. We then identified a panel of VF categories that were significantly upregulated in PDAC patients, these being associated with bacterial adherence, exoenzyme production, and nutritional/metabolic processes. Moreover, Streptococcus-derived VFs were notably enriched in PDAC patients. We developed a diagnostic model using random forest analysis based on the levels of these VFs. The model's diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88, indicating high accuracy in differentiating PDAC patients from healthy controls. Our findings suggest that VFs encoded by the oral microbiome hold potential as diagnostic tools for PDAC, offering a non-invasive approach that could significantly enhance early detection and prognosis, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.

## High-Throughput Combined Analysis of Saliva Microbiota and Metabolomic Profile in Chinese Periodontitis Patients: A Pilot Study.
 26.12.2023, _J Ding, J Li, C Zhang, L Tan, C Zhao, L Gao_


The onset and progression of periodontitis involves complicated interactions between the dysbiotic oral microbiota and disrupted host immune-inflammatory response, which can be mirrored by the changes in salivary metabolites profile. This pilot study sought to examine the saliva microbiome and metabolome in the Chinese population by the combined approach of 16s rRNA sequencing and high-throughput targeted metabolomics to discover potential cues for host-microbe metabolic interactions. Unstimulated whole saliva samples were collected from eighteen Stage III and IV periodontitis patients and thirteen healthy subjects. Full-mouth periodontal parameters were recorded. The taxonomic composition of microbiota was obtained by 16s rRNA sequencing, and the metabolites were identified and measured by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis. The oral microbiota composition displayed marked changes where the abundance of 93 microbial taxa differed significantly between the periodontitis and healthy group. Targeted metabolomics identified 103 differential metabolites between the patients and healthy individuals. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated the upregulation of protein digestion and absorption, histidine metabolism, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathways in the dysbiotic microbiota, while the ferroptosis, tryptophan metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and carbon metabolism pathways were upregulated in the patients. Correlation analysis confirmed positive relationships between the clinical parameters, pathogen abundances, and disease-related metabolite levels. The integral analysis of the saliva microbiome and metabolome yielded an accurate presentation of the dysbiotic oral microbiome and functional alterations in host-microbe metabolism. The microbial and metabolic profiling of the saliva could be a potential tool in the diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and pathogenesis study of periodontitis.

High fat diets (HFDs) have been linked to several diseases including obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer. In this study, we examined the impact on intestinal gene expression of three isocaloric HFDs that differed only in their fatty acid composition-coconut oil (saturated fats), conventional soybean oil (polyunsaturated fats) and a genetically modified soybean oil (monounsaturated fats). Four functionally distinct segments of the mouse intestinal tract were analyzed using RNA-seq-duodenum, jejunum, terminal ileum and proximal colon. We found considerable dysregulation of genes in multiple tissues with the different diets, including those encoding nuclear receptors and genes involved in xenobiotic and drug metabolism, epithelial barrier function, IBD and colon cancer as well as genes associated with the microbiome and COVID-19. Network analysis shows that genes involved in metabolism tend to be upregulated by the HFDs while genes related to the immune system are downregulated; neurotransmitter signaling was also dysregulated by the HFDs. Genomic sequencing also revealed a microbiome altered by the HFDs. This study highlights the potential impact of different HFDs on gut health with implications for the organism as a whole and will serve as a reference for gene expression along the length of the intestines.

## GENERALIZED MATRIX DECOMPOSITION REGRESSION: ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE FOR TWO-WAY STRUCTURED DATA.
 28.12.2023, _Y Wang, A Shojaie, T Randolph, P Knight, J Ma_


Motivated by emerging applications in ecology, microbiology, and neuroscience, this paper studies high-dimensional regression with two-way structured data. To estimate the high-dimensional coefficient vector, we propose the generalized matrix decomposition regression (GMDR) to efficiently leverage auxiliary information on row and column structures. GMDR extends the principal component regression (PCR) to two-way structured data, but unlike PCR, GMDR selects the components that are most predictive of the outcome, leading to more accurate prediction. For inference on regression coefficients of individual variables, we propose the generalized matrix decomposition inference (GMDI), a general high-dimensional inferential framework for a large family of estimators that include the proposed GMDR estimator. GMDI provides more flexibility for incorporating relevant auxiliary row and column structures. As a result, GMDI does not require the true regression coefficients to be sparse, but constrains the coordinate system representing the regression coefficients according to the column structure. GMDI also allows dependent and heteroscedastic observations. We study the theoretical properties of GMDI in terms of both the type-I error rate and power and demonstrate the effectiveness of GMDR and GMDI in simulation studies and an application to human microbiome data.

## Single-cell and spatiotemporal transcriptomic analyses reveal the effects of microorganisms on immunity and metabolism in the mouse liver.

The gut-liver axis is a complex bidirectional communication pathway between the intestine and the liver in which microorganisms and their metabolites flow from the intestine through the portal vein to the liver and influence liver function. In a sterile environment, the phenotype or function of the liver is altered, but few studies have investigated the specific cellular and molecular effects of microorganisms on the liver. To this end, we constructed single-cell and spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles of germ-free (GF) and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mouse livers. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) revealed that the ratio of most immune cells was altered in the liver of GF mice; in particular, natural killer T (NKT) cells, IgA plasma cells (IgAs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) were significantly reduced in GF mice. Spatial enhanced resolution omics sequencing (Stereo-seq) confirmed that microorganisms mediated the accumulation of Kupffer cells in the periportal zone. Unexpectedly, IgA plasma cells were more numerous and concentrated in the periportal vein in liver sections from SPF mice but less numerous and scattered in GF mice. ST technology also enables the precise zonation of liver lobules into eight layers and three patterns based on the gene expression level in each layer, allowing us to further investigate the effects of microbes on gene zonation patterns and functions. Furthermore, untargeted metabolism experiments of the liver revealed that the propionic acid levels were significantly lower in GF mice, and this reduction may be related to the control of genes involved in bile acid and fatty acid metabolism. In conclusion, the combination of sc/snRNA-seq, Stereo-seq, and untargeted metabolomics revealed immune system defects as well as altered bile acid and lipid metabolic processes at the single-cell and spatial levels in the livers of GF mice. This study will be of great value for understanding host-microbiota interactions.

## Mock microbial community meta-analysis using different trimming of amplicon read lengths.
 27.12.2023, _D Haider, MW Hall, J LaRoche, RG Beiko_


Trimming of sequencing reads is a pre-processing step that aims to discard sequence segments such as primers, adapters and low quality nucleotides that will interfere with clustering and classification steps. We evaluated the impact of trimming length of paired-end 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon reads on the ability to reconstruct the taxonomic composition and relative abundances of communities with a known composition in both even and uneven proportions. We found that maximizing read retention maximizes recall but reduces precision by increasing false positives. The presence of expected taxa was accurately predicted across broad trim length ranges but recovering original relative proportions remains a difficult challenge. We show that parameters that maximize taxonomic recovery do not simultaneously maximize relative abundance accuracy. Trim length represents one of several experimental parameters that have non-uniform impact across microbial clades, making it a difficult parameter to optimize. This study offers insights, guidelines, and helps researchers assess the significance of their decisions when trimming raw reads in a microbiome analysis based on overlapping or non-overlapping paired-end amplicons.

## In Vitro Models for Investigating Intestinal Host-Pathogen Interactions.
 28.12.2023, _R McCoy, S Oldroyd, W Yang, K Wang, D Hoven, D Bulmer, M Zilbauer, RM Owens_


Infectious diseases are increasingly recognized as a major threat worldwide due to the rise of antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of novel pathogens. In vitro models that can adequately mimic in vivo gastrointestinal physiology are in high demand to elucidate mechanisms behind pathogen infectivity, and to aid the design of effective preventive and therapeutic interventions. There exists a trade-off between simple and high throughput models and those that are more complex and physiologically relevant. The complexity of the model used shall be guided by the biological question to be addressed. This review provides an overview of the structure and function of the intestine and the models that are developed to emulate this. Conventional models are discussed in addition to emerging models which employ engineering principles to equip them with necessary advanced monitoring capabilities for intestinal host-pathogen interrogation. Limitations of current models and future perspectives on the field are presented.
