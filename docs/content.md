Chronic stress disrupts microbiota-gut-brain axis function and is associated with altered tryptophan metabolism, impaired gut barrier function, and disrupted diurnal rhythms. However, little is known about the effects of acute stress on the gut and how it is influenced by diurnal physiology. Here, we used germ-free and antibiotic-depleted mice to understand how microbiota-dependent oscillations in tryptophan metabolism would alter gut barrier function at baseline and in response to an acute stressor. Cecal metabolomics identified tryptophan metabolism as most responsive to a 15-min acute stressor, while shotgun metagenomics revealed that most bacterial species exhibiting rhythmicity metabolize tryptophan. Our findings highlight that the gastrointestinal response to acute stress is dependent on the time of day and the microbiome, with a signature of stress-induced functional alterations in the ileum and altered tryptophan metabolism in the colon.

## The Landscape and Perspectives of the Human Gut Metaproteomics.
 12.04.2024, _Z Sun, Z Ning, D Figeys_


The human gut microbiome is closely associated with human health and diseases. Metaproteomics has emerged as a valuable tool for studying the functionality of the gut microbiome by analyzing the entire proteins present in microbial communities. Recent advancements in liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques have expanded the detection range of metaproteomics. However, the overall coverage of the proteome in metaproteomics is still limited. While metagenomics studies have revealed substantial microbial diversity and functional potential of the human gut microbiome, few studies have summarized and studied the human gut microbiome landscape revealed with metaproteomics. In this paper, we present the current landscape of human gut metaproteomics studies by re-analyzing the identification results from fifteen published studies. We quantified the limited proteome coverage in metaproteomics and revealed a high proportion of annotation coverage of metaproteomics-identified proteins. We conducted a preliminary comparison between the metaproteomics view and the metagenomics view of the human gut microbiome, identifying key areas of consistency and divergence. Based on the current landscape of human gut metaproteomics, we discuss the feasibility of using metaproteomics to study functionally unknown proteins and propose a whole workflow peptide-centric analysis. Additionally, we suggest enhancing metaproteomics analysis by refining taxonomic classification and calculating confidence scores, as well as developing tools for analyzing the interaction between taxonomy and function.

## Endosymbiont diversity across native and invasive brown widow spider populations.

The invasive brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus (Araneae: Theridiidae), has spread in multiple locations around the world and, along with it, brought associated organisms such as endosymbionts. We investigated endosymbiont diversity and prevalence across putative native and invasive populations of this spider, predicting lower endosymbiont diversity across the invasive range compared to the native range. First, we characterized the microbial community in the putative native (South Africa) and invasive (Israel and the United States) ranges via high throughput 16S sequencing of 103 adult females. All specimens were dominated by reads from only 1-3 amplicon sequence variants (ASV), and most individuals were infected with an apparently uniform strain of Rhabdochlamydia. We also found Rhabdochlamydia in spider eggs, indicating that it is a maternally-inherited endosymbiont. Relatively few other ASV were detected, but included two variant Rhabdochlamydia strains and several Wolbachia, Spiroplasma and Enterobacteriaceae strains. We then diagnostically screened 118 adult female spiders from native and invasive populations specifically for Rhabdochlamydia and Wolbachia. We found Rhabdochlamydia in 86% of individuals and represented in all populations, which suggests that it is a consistent and potentially important associate of L. geometricus. Wolbachia was found at lower overall prevalence (14%) and was represented in all countries, but not all populations. In addition, we found evidence for geographic variation in endosymbiont prevalence: spiders from Israel were more likely to carry Rhabdochlamydia than those from the US and South Africa, and Wolbachia was geographically clustered in both Israel and South Africa. Characterizing endosymbiont prevalence and diversity is a first step in understanding their function inside the host and may shed light on the process of spread and population variability in cosmopolitan invasive species.

## Localization and symbiotic status of probiotics in the coral holobiont.

Corals establish symbiotic relationships with microorganisms, especially endosymbiotic photosynthetic algae. Although other microbes have been commonly detected in coral tissues, their identity and beneficial functions for their host are unclear. Here, we confirm the beneficial outcomes of the inoculation of bacteria selected as probiotics and use fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to define their localization in the coral Pocillopora damicornis. Our results show the first evidence of the inherent presence of Halomonas sp. and Cobetia sp. in native coral tissues, even before their inoculation. Furthermore, the relative enrichment of these coral tissue-associated bacteria through their inoculation in corals correlates with health improvements, such as increases in photosynthetic potential, and productivity. Our study suggests the symbiotic status of Halomonas sp. and Cobetia sp. in corals by indicating their localization within coral gastrodermis and epidermis and correlating their increased relative abundance through active inoculation with beneficial outcomes for the holobiont. This knowledge is crucial to facilitate the screening and application of probiotics that may not be transient members of the coral microbiome.

## Global insights into endophytic bacterial communities of terrestrial plants: Exploring the potential applications of endophytic microbiota in sustainable agriculture.
 14.04.2024, _L Huang, Y Fu, Y Liu, Y Chen, T Wang, M Wang, X Lin, Y Feng_


Endophytic microorganisms are indispensable symbionts during plant growth and development and often serve functions such as growth promotion and stress resistance in plants. Therefore, an increasing number of researchers have applied endophytes for multifaceted phytoremediation (e.g., organic pollutants and heavy metals) in recent years. With the availability of next-generation sequencing technologies, an increasing number of studies have shifted the focus from culturable bacteria to total communities. However, information on the composition, structure, and function of bacterial endophytic communities is still not widely synthesized. To explore the general patterns of variation in bacterial communities between plant niches, we reanalyzed data from 1499 samples in 30 individual studies from different continents and provided comprehensive insights. A group of bacterial genera were commonly found in most plant roots and shoots. Our analysis revealed distinct variations in the diversity, composition, structure, and function of endophytic bacterial communities between plant roots and shoots. These variations underscore the sophisticated mechanisms by which plants engage with their endophytic microbiota, optimizing these interactions to bolster growth, health, and resilience against stress. Highlighting the strategic role of endophytic bacteria in promoting sustainable agricultural practices and environmental stewardship, our study not only offers global insights into the endophytic bacterial communities of terrestrial plants but also underscores the untapped potential of these communities as invaluable resources for future research.

## Microbiome Analysis Revealed Acholeplasma as a Possible Factor Influencing the Susceptibility to Bacterial Leaf Blight Disease of Two Domestic Rice Cultivars in Vietnam.
 16.04.2024, _TTH Nguyen, C Bez, I Bertani, MH Nguyen, TKN Nguyen, V Venturi, HT Dinh_


The microbiomes of two important rice cultivars in Vietnam which differ by their susceptibility to the bacterial leaf blight (BLB) disease were analyzed through 16S rRNA amplicon technology. A higher number of operational taxonomic units and alpha-diversity indices were shown in the BLB-resistant LA cultivar than in the BLB-susceptible TB cultivar. The BLB pathogen Xanthomonas was scantly found (0.003%) in the LA cultivar, whereas was in a significantly higher ratio in the TB cultivar (1.82%), reflecting the susceptibility to BLB of these cultivars. Of special interest was the genus Acholeplasma presented in the BLB-resistant LA cultivar at a high relative abundance (22.32%), however, was minor in the BLB-sensitive TB cultivar (0.09%), raising a question about its roles in controlling the Xanthomonas low in the LA cultivar. It is proposed that Acholeplasma once entered the host plant would hamper other phytopathogens, i.e. Xanthomonas, by yet unknown mechanisms, of which the triggering of the host plants to produce secondary metabolites against pathogens could be a testable hypothesis.
