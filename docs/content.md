## Genetic association between gut microbiome and blood pressure and blood cell count as mediator: A two-step Mendelian randomization analysis.
 18.05.2024, _J Zhang, J He, Y Liao, X Xia, F Yang_


Previous studies have established a genetic link between gut microbiota and hypertension, but whether blood cell count plays a mediating role in this remains unknown. This study aims to explore genetic associations and causal factors involving the gut microbiome, peripheral blood cell count, and blood pressure.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy in childbearing-age females which can cause many complications, such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. The metabolic disorders in patients with PCOS were linked to gut microbial dysbiosis. However, the correlation between the gut microbial community and dyslipidemia in PCOS remains unillustrated. Our study elucidated the different gut microbiota in patients with PCOS and dyslipidemia (PCOS.D) compared to those with only PCOS and healthy women.

## Ibuprofen degradation by mixed bacterial consortia: metabolic pathway and microbial community analysis.
 17.05.2024, _A Rastogi, S Chaudhary, MK Tiwari, MM Ghangrekar_


Degradation of ibuprofen, one of the most consumed drugs globally, by a mixed bacterial consortium was investigated. A contaminated hospital soil was used to enrich a bacterial consortium possessing the ability to degrade 4 mg/L ibuprofen in 6 days, fed on 6 mM acetate as a supplementary carbon source. Maximum ibuprofen degradation achieved was 99.51%, and for optimum ibuprofen degradation modelled statistically, the initial ibuprofen concentration, and temperature were determined to be 0.515 mg/L and 35 °C, respectively. The bacterial community analyses demonstrated an enrichment of Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Bacillus, and Enterococcus in the presence of ibuprofen, suggesting their probable association with the biodegradation process. The biodegradation pathway developed using open-source metabolite predictors, GLORYx and BioTransformer suggested multiple degradation routes. Hydroxylation and oxidation were found to be the major mechanisms in ibuprofen degradation. Mono-hydroxylated metabolites were identified as well as predicted by the bioinformatics-based packages. Oxidation, dehydrogenation, super-hydroxylation, and hydrolysis were some other identified mechanisms.

## Examining the impacts of salt specificity on freshwater microbial community and functional potential following salinization.

The degradation of freshwater systems by salt pollution is a threat to global freshwater resources. Salinization is commonly identified by increased specific conductance (conductivity), a proxy for salt concentrations. However, conductivity fails to account for the diversity of salts entering freshwaters and the potential implications this has on microbial communities and functions. We tested 4 types of salt pollution-MgCl2, MgSO4, NaCl, and Na2SO4-on bacterial taxonomic and functional α-, β-diversity of communities originating from streams in two distinct localities (Nebraska [NE] and Ohio [OH], USA). Community responses depended on the site of origin, with NE and OH exhibiting more pronounced decreases in community diversity in response to Na2SO4 and MgCl2 than other salt amendments. A closer examination of taxonomic and functional diversity metrics suggests that core features of communities are more resistant to induced salt stress and that marginal features at both a population and functional level are more likely to exhibit significant structural shifts based on salt specificity. The lack of uniformity in community response highlights the need to consider the compositional complexities of salinization to accurately identify the ecological consequences of instances of salt pollution.

## Periodontopathogen-Related Cell Autophagy-A Double-Edged Sword.
 19.05.2024, _L Ma, Z Cao_


The periodontium is a highly organized ecosystem, and the imbalance between oral microorganisms and host defense leads to periodontal diseases. The periodontal pathogens, mainly Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, colonize the periodontal niches or enter the blood circulation, resulting in periodontal tissue destruction and distal organ damage. This phenomenon links periodontitis with various systemic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumors, steatohepatitis, and Alzheimer's disease. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular self-degradation process essential for eliminating internalized pathogens. Nowadays, increasing studies have been carried out in cells derived from periodontal tissues, immune system, and distant organs to investigate the relationship between periodontal pathogen infection and autophagy-related activities. On one hand, as a vital part of innate and adaptive immunity, autophagy actively participates in host resistance to periodontal bacterial infection. On the other, certain periodontal pathogens exploit autophagic vesicles or pathways to evade immune surveillance, therefore achieving survival within host cells. This review provides an overview of the autophagy process and focuses on periodontopathogen-related autophagy and their involvements in cells of different tissue origins, so as to comprehensively understand the role of autophagy in the occurrence and development of periodontal diseases and various periodontitis-associated systemic illnesses.
