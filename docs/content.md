This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Analyzing microbial evolution through gene and genome phylogenies.
 06.11.2023, _S Teichman, MD Lee, AD Willis_


Microbiome scientists critically need modern tools to explore and analyze microbial evolution. Often this involves studying the evolution of microbial genomes as a whole. However, different genes in a single genome can be subject to different evolutionary pressures, which can result in distinct gene-level evolutionary histories. To address this challenge, we propose to treat estimated gene-level phylogenies as data objects, and present an interactive method for the analysis of a collection of gene phylogenies. We use a local linear approximation of phylogenetic tree space to visualize estimated gene trees as points in low-dimensional Euclidean space, and address important practical limitations of existing related approaches, allowing an intuitive visualization of complex data objects. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed approach through microbial data analyses, including by identifying outlying gene histories in strains of Prevotella, and by contrasting Streptococcus phylogenies estimated using different gene sets. Our method is available as an open-source R package, and assists with estimating, visualizing, and interacting with a collection of bacterial gene phylogenies.

## Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in health-care workers: a cross-sectional study at a northern Peruvian hospital.
 15.12.2023, _ED Meregildo-Rodriguez, V Yuptón-Chávez, MG Asmat-Rubio, GA Vásquez-Tirado_


Healthcare workers (HCWs) have a higher risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active tuberculosis than the general population. In HCWs, the risk of tuberculosis infection depends on the local tuberculosis prevalence, HCWs' characteristics, the healthcare facility, and prevention and control measures. We aimed to estimate the prevalence and risk factors for LTBI in HCWs at a northern Peruvian hospital.

## The maternal gut microbiome in pregnancy: implications for the developing immune system.
 14.12.2023, _O Koren, L Konnikova, P Brodin, IU Mysorekar, MC Collado_


The gut microbiome has important roles in host metabolism and immunity, and microbial dysbiosis affects human physiology and health. Maternal immunity and microbial metabolites during pregnancy, microbial transfer during birth, and transfer of immune factors, microorganisms and metabolites via breastfeeding provide critical sources of early-life microbial and immune training, with important consequences for human health. Only a few studies have directly examined the interactions between the gut microbiome and the immune system during pregnancy, and the subsequent effect on offspring development. In this Review, we aim to describe how the maternal microbiome shapes overall pregnancy-associated maternal, fetal and early neonatal immune systems, focusing on the existing evidence and highlighting current gaps to promote further research.

## Shotgun metagenomics reveals interkingdom association between intestinal bacteria and fungi involving competition for nutrients.
 15.12.2023, _Z Xie, A Canalda-Baltrons, C d'Enfert, C Manichanh_


The accuracy of internal-transcribed-spacer (ITS) and shotgun metagenomics has not been robustly evaluated, and the effect of diet on the composition and function of the bacterial and fungal gut microbiome in a longitudinal setting has been poorly investigated. Here we compared two approaches to study the fungal community (ITS and shotgun metagenomics), proposed an enrichment protocol to perform a reliable mycobiome analysis using a comprehensive in-house fungal database, and correlated dietary data with both bacterial and fungal communities.

## Fiber-deficient diet inhibits colitis through the regulation of the niche and metabolism of a gut pathobiont.
 15.12.2023, _P Kuffa, JM Pickard, A Campbell, M Yamashita, SR Schaus, EC Martens, TM Schmidt, N Inohara, G Núñez, R Caruso_


Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) with fiber-free diets is an effective steroid-sparing treatment to induce clinical remission in children with Crohn's disease (CD). However, the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of EEN remains obscure. Using a model of microbiota-dependent colitis with the hallmarks of CD, we find that the administration of a fiber-free diet prevents the development of colitis and inhibits intestinal inflammation in colitic animals. Remarkably, fiber-free diet alters the intestinal localization of Mucispirillum schaedleri, a mucus-dwelling pathobiont, which is required for triggering disease. Mechanistically, the absence of dietary fiber reduces nutrient availability and impairs the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) metabolic pathway of Mucispirillum, leading to its exclusion from the mucus layer and disease remission. Thus, appropriate localization of the specific pathobiont in the mucus layer is critical for disease development, which is disrupted by fiber exclusion. These results suggest strategies to treat CD by targeting the intestinal niche and metabolism of disease-causing microbes.

## Turnover of strain-level diversity modulates functional traits in the honeybee gut microbiome between nurses and foragers.
 09.12.2023, _GLC Baud, A Prasad, KM Ellegaard, P Engel_


Strain-level diversity is widespread among bacterial species and can expand the functional potential of natural microbial communities. However, to what extent communities undergo consistent shifts in strain composition in response to environmental/host changes is less well understood.

## Infant gut DNA bacteriophage strain persistence during the first 3 years of life.
 14.12.2023, _YC Lou, L Chen, AL Borges, J West-Roberts, BA Firek, MJ Morowitz, JF Banfield_


Bacteriophages are key components of gut microbiomes, yet the phage colonization process in the infant gut remains uncertain. Here, we establish a large phage sequence database and use strain-resolved analyses to investigate DNA phage succession in infants throughout the first 3 years of life. Analysis of 819 fecal metagenomes collected from 28 full-term and 24 preterm infants and their mothers revealed that early-life phageome richness increases over time and reaches adult-like complexity by age 3. Approximately 9% of early phage colonizers, which are mostly maternally transmitted and infect Bacteroides, persist for 3 years and are more prevalent in full-term than in preterm infants. Although rare, phages with stop codon reassignment are more likely to persist than non-recoded phages and generally display an increase in in-frame reassigned stop codons over 3 years. Overall, maternal seeding, stop codon reassignment, host CRISPR-Cas locus prevalence, and diverse phage populations contribute to stable viral colonization.

## Knowledge and practice of obstetric care providers on prevention of obstetric fistula 2023: an institution-based cross-sectional study.
 15.12.2023, _SS Alemu, MT Agago, EY Ukumo, TS Hadero_


Obstetric fistula is a preventable devastating condition that is mostly caused by obstructed labour. About 22% of obstructed labor is complicated by obstetric fistula. Skilled birth attendants during delivery are essential for the prevention of obstetric fistula. However, little is known about the status of the knowledge and practice of obstetric fistula prevention in the Gamo zone.

## Gender diversity in a Chinese community sample and its associations with autism traits.
 15.12.2023, _AIR van der Miesen, SY Shi, HC Lei, CL Ngan, DP VanderLaan, WI Wong_


Emerging evidence suggests that gender dysphoria or gender diversity (GD) intersects frequently with autism spectrum disorder or autism traits. However, the magnitude and interpretation of this link continue to be debated. Most child studies on this topic were performed in clinical populations, and little is known about the generalizability of this co-occurrence to the broader community, especially to non-Western samples. Also, little is known about whether specific subdomains of autism are more strongly associated with GD. Therefore, we investigated GD and its association with autism traits in a Chinese community sample of 4-12-year-olds (N = 379; 51% birth-assigned girls). Parents provided information about GD characteristics using the standardized Gender Identity Questionnaire for Children and autism traits using the Chinese version of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient-Children. In addition, broader behavioral and emotional challenges were measured by the Behavior Problem Index (BPI) to account for psychological challenges other than autism traits. In this community sample of Chinese children, increased GD was associated with increased autism traits, even after accounting for the BPI. Of the four subscales, the Imagination and Patterns subscales in birth-assigned girls and the Imagination subscale in birth-assigned boys were especially associated with GD. These findings indicate that the association between GD and autism traits generalizes to a nonclinical, non-Western sample. Clinicians and researchers working with clinical as well as community children should thus pay attention to the co-occurrence of GD and autism traits, in and outside the West.
