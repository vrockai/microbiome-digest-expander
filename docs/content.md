 05.03.2024, _J Li, Y Zhang, Y Cai, P Yao, Y Jia, X Wei, C Du, S Zhang_


Research has indicated that intratumor microbiomes affect the occurrence, progression, and therapeutic response in many cancer types by influencing the immune system. We aim to evaluate the characteristics of immune-related intratumor microbiomes (IRIMs) in breast cancer (BC) and search for potential prognosis prediction factors and treatment targets. The clinical information, microbiome data, transcriptomics data of The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) patients were obtained from Kraken-TCGA-Raw-Data and TCGA portal. The core tumor-infiltrating immune cell was identified using univariate Cox regression analysis. Based on consensus clustering analysis, BC patients were categorized into two immune subtypes, referred to as immune-enriched and immune-deficient subtypes. The immune-enriched subtype, characterized by higher levels of immune infiltration of CD8+ T and macrophage M1 cells, demonstrated a more favorable prognosis. Furthermore, significant differences in alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were observed between the two immune subtypes, and the least discriminant analysis effect size method identified 33 types of IRIMs. An intratumor microbiome-based prognostic signature consisting of four prognostic IRIMs (Acidibacillus, Succinimonas, Lachnoclostridium, and Pseudogulbenkiania) was constructed using the Cox proportional-hazard model, and it had great prognostic value. The prognostic IRIMs were correlated with immune gene expression and the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs, specifically tamoxifen and docetaxel. In conclusion, our research has successfully identified two distinct immune subtypes in BC, which exhibit contrasting prognoses and possess unique epigenetic and intratumor microbiomes. The critical IRIMs were correlated with prognosis, tumor-infiltrating immune cell abundance, and immunotherapeutic efficacy in BC. Consequently, this study has identified potential IRIMs as biomarkers, providing a novel therapeutic approach for treating BC.IMPORTANCERecent research has substantiated the presence of the intratumor microbiome in tumor immune microenvironment, which could influence tumor occurrence and progression, as well as provide new opportunities for cancer diagnosis and treatment. This study identified the critical immune-related intratumor microbiome (Acidibacillus, Succinimonas, Lachnoclostridium, and Pseudogulbenkiania), which were correlated with prognosis, tumor-infiltrating immune cell abundance, and immunotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer and might be the novel target to regulate immunotherapy in BC.

## Protein combined with certain dietary fibers increases butyrate production in gut microbiota fermentation.
 05.03.2024, _R Jackson, T Yao, N Bulut, TM Cantu-Jungles, BR Hamaker_


The modern diet delivers nearly equal amounts of carbohydrates and protein into the colon representing an important protein increase compared to past higher fiber diets. At the same time, plant-based protein foods have become increasingly popular, and these sources of protein are generally less digestible than animal protein sources. As a result, a significant amount of protein is expected to reach the colon and be available for fermentation by gut microbiota. While studies on diet-microbiota interventions have mainly focused on carbohydrate fermentation, limited attention has been given to the role of protein or protein-fiber mixtures as fermentation substrates for the colonic microbiota. In this study, we aimed to investigate: (1) how changing the ratio of protein to fiber substrates affects the types and quantities of gut microbial metabolites and bacteria; and (2) how the specific fermentation characteristics of different types of fiber might influence the utilization of protein by gut microbes to produce beneficial short chain fatty acids. Our results revealed that protein fermentation in the gut plays a crucial role in shaping the overall composition of microbiota communities and their metabolic outputs. Surprisingly, butyrate production was maintained or increased when fiber and protein were combined, and even when pure protein samples were used as substrates. These findings suggest that indigestible protein in fiber-rich substrates may promote the production of microbial butyrate perhaps including the later stages of fermentation in the large intestine.

## A human milk oligosaccharide prevents intestinal inflammation in adulthood via modulating gut microbial metabolism.
 05.03.2024, _KM Schalich, MA Buendia, H Kaur, YA Choksi, MK Washington, GS Codreanu, SD Sherrod, JA McLean, RM Peek, SA Acra, SD Townsend, F Yan_


Observational evidence suggests that human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) promote the growth of commensal bacteria in early life and adulthood. However, the mechanisms by which HMOs benefit health through modulation of gut microbial homeostasis remain largely unknown. 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) is the most abundant oligosaccharide in human milk and contributes to the essential health benefits associated with human milk consumption. Here, we investigated how 2'-FL prevents colitis in adulthood through its effects on the gut microbial community. We found that the gut microbiota from adult mice that consumed 2'-FL exhibited an increase in abundance of several health-associated genera, including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. The 2'-FL-modulated gut microbial community exerted preventive effects on colitis in adult mice. By using Bifidobacterium infantis as a 2'-FL-consuming bacterial model, exploratory metabolomics revealed novel 2'-FL-enriched secretory metabolites by Bifidobacterium infantis, including pantothenol. Importantly, pantothenate significantly protected the intestinal barrier against oxidative stress and mitigated colitis in adult mice. Furthermore, microbial metabolic pathway analysis identified 26 dysregulated metabolic pathways in fecal microbiota from patients with ulcerative colitis, which were significantly regulated by 2'-FL treatment in adult mice, indicating that 2'-FL has the potential to rectify dysregulated microbial metabolism in colitis. These findings support the contribution of the 2'-FL-shaped gut microbial community and bacterial metabolite production to the protection of intestinal integrity and prevention of intestinal inflammation in adulthood.IMPORTANCEAt present, neither basic research nor clinical studies have revealed the exact biological functions or mechanisms of action of individual oligosaccharides during development or in adulthood. Thus, it remains largely unknown whether human milk oligosaccharides could serve as effective therapeutics for gastrointestinal-related diseases. Results from the present study uncover 2'-FL-driven alterations in bacterial metabolism and identify novel B. infantis-secreted metabolites following the consumption of 2'-FL, including pantothenol. This work further demonstrates a previously unrecognized role of pantothenate in significantly protecting the intestinal barrier against oxidative stress and mitigating colitis in adult mice. Remarkably, 2'-FL-enhanced bacterial metabolic pathways are found to be dysregulated in the fecal microbiota of ulcerative colitis patients. These novel metabolic pathways underlying the bioactivities of 2'-FL may lay a foundation for applying individual oligosaccharides for prophylactic intervention for diseases associated with impaired intestinal homeostasis.

The human gut microbiota is a dynamic community of microorganisms that undergo variable changes over the entire life span. To thoroughly investigate the possible fluctuations of the microbiota throughout human life, we performed a pooled analysis of healthy fecal samples across different age groups covering the entire human life span. Our study integrated data from 79 publicly available studies and new stool samples from an Italian cohort, i.e., the Parma Microbiota project, resulting in 6,653 samples processed through the shotgun metagenomic approach. This approach has allowed species-level taxonomic reconstruction of the gut microbiota and investigation of its metabolic potential across the human life span. From a taxonomic point of view, our findings confirmed and detailed at species-level accuracy that the microbial richness of the gut microbiota gradually increases in the first stage of life, becoming relatively stable during adolescence. Moreover, the analysis identified the potential core microbiota representative of distinct age groups, revealing age-related bacterial patterns and the continuous rearrangement of the microbiota in terms of relative abundances across the life span rather than the acquisition and loss of taxa. Furthermore, the shotgun approach provided insights into the functional contribution of the human gut microbiome. The metagenomic analysis revealed functional age-related differences, particularly in carbohydrate and fiber metabolism, suggesting a co-evolution of the microbiome assembly with diet. Additionally, we identified correlations between vitamin synthesis, such as thiamine and niacin, and early life, suggesting a potential role of the microbiome in human physiology, in particular in the functions of the host's nervous and immune systems.

## The effects of hydrolyzed protein on macronutrient digestibility, fecal metabolites and microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers, and skin and coat quality in adult dogs.
 05.03.2024, _C Hsu, F Marx, R Guldenpfennig, N Valizadegan, MRC de Godoy_


Research on protein hydrolysates has observed various properties and functionalities on ingredients depending on the type of hydrolysate. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of hydrolyzed chicken protein that was incorporated into diets on digestibility, gut health, skin and coat health, oxidative stress, and intestinal inflammation markers in healthy adult dogs. Five complete and balanced diets were manufactured: 1) CONd: 25% chicken meal diet; 2) 5% CLHd: 5% chicken liver and heart hydrolysate plus 20% chicken meal diet; 3) CLHd: 25% chicken liver and heart hydrolysate diet; 4) 5% CHd: 5% chicken hydrolysate plus 20% chicken meal diet; 5) CHd: 25% chicken hydrolysate diet. A replicated 5×5 Latin square design was used which included 10 neutered adult Beagles. Each of the 5 periods consisted of a 7-d washout time and a 28-d treatment period. All diets were well accepted by the dogs. Fecal butyrate concentration was higher while fecal isovalerate and total phenol/indole were lower in dogs fed CLHd than CONd (P &lt; 0.05). Dogs fed CHd had higher fecal immunoglobulin A concentration when compared with CLHd (P &lt; 0.05); however, both groups were comparable to the CONd. There was no difference among groups in serum cytokine concentrations, serum oxidative stress biomarkers, or skin and coat health analyses (P &gt; 0.05). Fecal microbiota was shifted by CLHd with higher abundance in Ruminococcus gauvreauii group as well as lower Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Sutterella, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides when compared with CONd (P &lt; 0.05). There was also a difference in beta diversity of fecal microbiota between CLHd and CHd (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, chicken protein hydrolysate could be incorporated into canine extruded diets as a comparable source of protein to traditional chicken meal. The test chicken protein hydrolysates showed the potential to support gut health by modulating immune response and microbiota; however, functional properties of protein hydrolysates are dependent on inclusion level and source.

Global warming is causing large-scale disruption of cnidarian-Symbiodiniaceae symbioses fundamental to major marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs. However, the mechanisms by which heat stress perturbs these symbiotic partnerships remain poorly understood. In this context, the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea has emerged as a powerful experimental model system.

## An engineered bacterial symbiont allows noninvasive biosensing of the honey bee gut environment.
 05.03.2024, _A Chhun, S Moriano-Gutierrez, F Zoppi, A Cabirol, P Engel, Y Schaerli_


The honey bee is a powerful model system to probe host-gut microbiota interactions, and an important pollinator species for natural ecosystems and for agriculture. While bacterial biosensors can provide critical insight into the complex interplay occurring between a host and its associated microbiota, the lack of methods to noninvasively sample the gut content, and the limited genetic tools to engineer symbionts, have so far hindered their development in honey bees. Here, we built a versatile molecular tool kit to genetically modify symbionts and reported for the first time in the honey bee a technique to sample their feces. We reprogrammed the native bee gut bacterium Snodgrassella alvi as a biosensor for IPTG, with engineered cells that stably colonize the gut of honey bees and report exposure to the molecules in a dose-dependent manner through the expression of a fluorescent protein. We showed that fluorescence readout can be measured in the gut tissues or noninvasively in the feces. These tools and techniques will enable rapid building of engineered bacteria to answer fundamental questions in host-gut microbiota research.

## Discovery and characterization of novel DNA viruses in Apis mellifera: expanding the honey bee virome through metagenomic analysis.
 05.03.2024, _D Kadlečková, M Saláková, T Erban, R Tachezy_


To date, many viruses have been discovered to infect honey bees. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing to expand the known virome of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, by identifying several novel DNA viruses. While the majority of previously identified bee viruses are RNA, our study reveals nine new genomes from the Parvoviridae family, tentatively named Bee densoviruses 1 to 9. In addition, we characterized a large DNA virus, Apis mellifera filamentous-like virus (AmFLV), which shares limited protein identities with the known Apis mellifera filamentous virus. The complete sequence of AmFLV, obtained by a combination of laboratory techniques and bioinformatics, spans 152,678 bp. Linear dsDNA genome encodes for 112 proteins, of which 49 are annotated. Another large virus we discovered is Apis mellifera nudivirus, which belongs to a group of Alphanudivirus. The virus has a length of 129,467 bp and a circular dsDNA genome, and has 106 protein encoding genes. The virus contains most of the core genes of the family Nudiviridae. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of viral binning in identifying viruses in honey bee virology, showcasing its initial application in this field.IMPORTANCEHoney bees contribute significantly to food security by providing pollination services. Understanding the virome of honey bees is crucial for the health and conservation of bee populations and also for the stability of the ecosystems and economies for which they are indispensable. This study unveils previously unknown DNA viruses in the honey bee virome, expanding our knowledge of potential threats to bee health. The use of the viral binning approach we employed in this study offers a promising method to uncovering and understanding the vast viral diversity in these essential pollinators.

## Taxonomic difference in marine bloom-forming phytoplanktonic species affects the dynamics of both bloom-responding prokaryotes and prokaryotic viruses.
 05.03.2024, _H Takebe, K Tominaga, T Isozaki, T Watanabe, K Yamamoto, R Kamikawa, T Yoshida_


The production of dissolved organic matter during phytoplankton blooms and consumption by heterotrophic prokaryotes promote marine carbon biogeochemical cycling. Although prokaryotic viruses presumably affect this process, their dynamics during blooms are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the effects of taxonomic difference in bloom-forming phytoplankton on prokaryotes and their viruses. We analyzed the dynamics of coastal prokaryotic communities and viruses under the addition of dissolved intracellular fractions from taxonomically distinct phytoplankton, the diatom Chaetoceros sp. (CIF) and the raphidophycean alga Heterosigma akashiwo (HIF), using microcosm experiments. Ribosomal RNA gene amplicon and viral metagenomic analyses revealed that particular prokaryotes and prokaryotic viruses specifically increased in either CIF or HIF, indicating that taxonomic difference in bloom-forming phytoplankton promotes distinct dynamics of not only the prokaryotic community but also prokaryotic viruses. Furthermore, combining our microcosm experiments with publicly available environmental data mining, we identified both known and novel possible host-virus pairs. In particular, the growth of prokaryotes associating with phytoplanktonic organic matter, such as Bacteroidetes (Polaribacter and NS9 marine group), Vibrio spp., and Rhodobacteriales (Nereida and Planktomarina), was accompanied by an increase in viruses predicted to infect Bacteroidetes, Vibrio, and Rhodobacteriales, respectively. Collectively, our findings suggest that changes in bloom-forming species can be followed by an increase in a specific group of prokaryotes and their viruses and that elucidating these tripartite relationships among specific phytoplankton, prokaryotes, and prokaryotic viruses improves our understanding of coastal biogeochemical cycling in blooms.IMPORTANCEThe primary production during marine phytoplankton bloom and the consumption of the produced organic matter by heterotrophic prokaryotes significantly contribute to coastal biogeochemical cycles. While the activities of those heterotrophic prokaryotes are presumably affected by viral infection, the dynamics of their viruses during blooms are not fully understood. In this study, we experimentally demonstrated that intracellular fractions of taxonomically distinct bloom-forming phytoplankton species, the diatom Chaetoceros sp. and the raphidophycean alga Heterosigma akashiwo, promoted the growth of taxonomically different prokaryotes and prokaryotic viruses. Based on their dynamics and predicted hosts of those viruses, we succeeded in detecting already-known and novel possible host-virus pairs associating with either phytoplankton species. Altogether, we propose that the succession of bloom-forming phytoplankton would change the composition of the abundant prokaryotes, resulting in an increase in their viruses. These changes in viral composition, depending on bloom-forming species, would alter the dynamics and metabolism of prokaryotes, affecting biogeochemical cycling in blooms.

## Microbiome sequencing revealed the abundance of uncultured bacteria in the Phatthalung sago palm-growing soil.
 05.03.2024, _P Nutaratat, T Arigul, N Srisuk, W Kruasuwan_


Environmental variations have been observed to influence bacterial community composition, thereby impacting biological activities in the soil. Together, the information on bacterial functional groups in Phatthalung sago palm-growing soils remains limited. In this work, the core soil bacterial community in the Phatthalung sago palm-growing areas during both the summer and rainy seasons was examined using V3-V4 amplicon sequencing. Our findings demonstrated that the seasons had no significant effects on the alpha diversity, but the beta diversity of the community was influenced by seasonal variations. The bacteria in the phyla Acidobacteriota, Actinobacteriota, Chloroflexi, Methylomirabilota, Planctomycetota, and Proteobacteria were predominantly identified across the soil samples. Among these, 26 genera were classified as a core microbiome, mostly belonging to uncultured bacteria. Gene functions related to photorespiration and methanogenesis were enriched in both seasons. Genes related to aerobic chemoheterotrophy metabolisms and nitrogen fixation were more abundant in the rainy season soils, while, human pathogen pneumonia-related genes were overrepresented in the summer season. The investigation not only provides into the bacterial composition inherent to the sago palm-cultivated soil but also the gene functions during the shift in seasons.

## The rhizosphere microbiome reduces the uptake of arsenic and tungsten by Blechnum orientale by increasing nutrient cycling in historical tungsten mining area soils.
 05.03.2024, _X Lan, Z Ning, Y Jia, W Lin, E Xiao, Q Cheng, Q Cai, T Xiao_


The growth of pioneer plants in metal mining area soil is closely related to their minimal uptake of toxic elements. Pioneer plants can inhibit the uptake of toxic elements by increasing nutrient uptake. However, few studies have focused on the mechanisms by which the rhizosphere microbiome affect nutrient cycling and their impact on the uptake of toxic elements by pioneer plants. In this study, we selected Blechnum orientale to investigate the potential roles of the rhizosphere microbiome in nutrient cycling and plant growth in a historical tungsten (W) mining area. Our results showed that while the arsenic (As) and W contents in the soil were relatively high, the enrichment levels of As and W in the B. orientale were relatively low. Furthermore, we found that the As and W contents in plants were significantly negatively correlated with soil nutrients (S, P and Mo), suggesting that elevated levels of these soil nutrients could inhibit As and W uptake by B. orientale. Importantly, we found that these nutrients were also identified as the most important factors shaping rhizosphere microbial attributes, including microbial diversity, ecological clusters, and keystone OTUs. Moreover, the genera, keystone taxa and microbial functional genes enriched in the rhizosphere soils from mining areas played a key role in nutrient (S, P and Mo) bioavailability, which could further increase the nutrient uptake by B. orientale. Taken together, our results suggest that rhizosphere microorganisms can improve pioneer plant growth by inhibiting toxic element accumulation via the increase in nutrient cycling in former W mining areas.
