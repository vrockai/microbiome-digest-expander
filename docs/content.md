The gut microbiota is the set of microorganisms present in the gut, and it is connected to the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis. Despite there is not a definitive description of the eubiotic microbiota architecture, numerous studies have demonstrated its involvement in human behaviour and its relationship with several pathologies. This is a systematic review about the association between dysbiosis on the gut microbiota and the presence of neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases such as cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ADHD, and depression. Furthermore, this study analyzes the potential benefits of psychobiotics supplementation for these pathologies. Searches were conducted in the electronic databases PubMed and PsycINFO. 17 articles were included in this review, the majority were published after 2019. The results showed that gut dysbiosis predicts the development of these pathologies and influences their pathogenesis. In addition, it was found that different psychobiotics, mainly dietary fibers and probiotics of the Lactobacillus family, improved different cognitive functions such as cognitive performance and induce a reduced cortisol response. Improvement in different cognitive functions is possible when understanding gut microbiota-brain axis, enteric nervous system, neural-immune system, neuroendocrine system, and central nervous system's relationship.

## Ecosystem-specific microbiota and microbiome databases in the era of big data.
 18.07.2022, _V Lobanov, A Gobet, A Joyce_


The rapid development of sequencing methods over the past decades has accelerated both the potential scope and depth of microbiota and microbiome studies. Recent developments in the field have been marked by an expansion away from purely categorical studies towards a greater investigation of community functionality. As in-depth genomic and environmental coverage is often distributed unequally across major taxa and ecosystems, it can be difficult to identify or substantiate relationships within microbial communities. Generic databases containing datasets from diverse ecosystems have opened a new era of data accessibility despite costs in terms of data quality and heterogeneity. This challenge is readily embodied in the integration of meta-omics data alongside habitat-specific standards which help contextualise datasets both in terms of sample processing and background within the ecosystem. A special case of large genomic repositories, ecosystem-specific databases (ES-DB's), have emerged to consolidate and better standardise sample processing and analysis protocols around individual ecosystems under study, allowing independent studies to produce comparable datasets. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of this emerging tool for microbial community analysis in relation to current trends in the field. We focus on the factors leading to the formation of ES-DB's, their comparison to traditional microbial databases, the potential for ES-DB integration with meta-omics platforms, as well as inherent limitations in the applicability of ES-DB's.
