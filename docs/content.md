Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are widely recorded in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and ASD with GI symptoms is a vital subtype of this disease. Growing evidence suggests altered gut microbiota biomarkers in ASD, but little is known about the gut microbiota of individuals with ASD with GI Symptoms, particularly in early childhood. In our study, the gut microbiota of 36 individuals with ASD along with GI symptoms and 40 typically developing (TD) children were compared using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The microbial diversity and composition were found to differ between the two groups. Compared to TD, the gut microbiota of ASD patients with GI symptoms exhibited decreased alpha diversity and depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus). In addition, microbial functional analysis showed abnormality in several gut metabolic models and gut brain models of ASD with GI symptoms, including SCFAshort-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis/degradation and neurotoxin-related p-cresol degradation, which are closely associated with ASD-related behaviors in animal models. Furthermore, we constructed a Support Vector Machine classification model, which robustly discriminated individuals with ASD and GI symptoms from TD individuals in a validation set (AUC = 0.88). Our findings provide a deep insight into the roles of the disturbed gut ecosystem in individuals with ASD and GI symptoms aged 3-6 years. Our classification model supports gut microbiota as a potential biomarker for the early identification of ASD and interventions targeting particular gut-beneficial microbiota.
