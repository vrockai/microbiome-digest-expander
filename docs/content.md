## Medium and long-term effects of low doses of Chlorpyrifos during the postnatal, preweaning developmental stage on sociability, dominance, gut microbiota and plasma metabolites.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental pathology characterized by altered verbalizations, reduced social interaction behavior, and stereotypies. Environmental factors have been associated with its development. Some researchers have focused on pesticide exposure. Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is the most used Organophosphate. Previous developmental studies with CPF showed decreased, enhanced or no effect on social outcomes eminently in mice. The study of CPF exposure during preweaning stages on social behavior is sparse in mice and non-existent in rats. d stressors could be at the basis of ASD development, and around postnatal day 10 in the rat is equivalent to the human birthday in neurodevelopmental terms. We explored the effects of exposure to low doses (1mg/kg/mL/day) of CPF during this stage regarding: sociability, dominance gut microbiome and plasma metabolomic profile, since alterations in these systems have also been linked to ASD. There was a modest influence of CPF on social behavior in adulthood, with null effects during adolescence. Dominance and hierarchical status were not affected by exposure. Dominance status explained the significant reduction in reaction to social novelty observed on the sociability test. CPF induced a significant gut microbiome dysbiosis and triggered a hyperlipidemic, hypoglycemic/hypogluconeogenesis and a general altered cell energy production in females. These behavioral results in rats extend and complement previous studies with mice and show novel influences on gut metagenomics and plasma lipid profile and metabolomics, but do not stablish a relation between the exposure to CPF and the ASD phenotype. The effects of dominance status on reaction to social novelty have an important methodological meaning for future research on sociability.

## Integrating the Ecosystem Services Framework to Define Dysbiosis of the Breastfed Infant Gut: The Role of B. infantis and Human Milk Oligosaccharides.
 01.05.2020, _RM Duar, BM Henrick, G Casaburi, SA Frese_


Mounting evidence supports a connection between the composition of the infant gut microbiome and long-term health. In fact, aberrant microbiome compositions during key developmental windows in early life are associated with increased disease risk; therefore, making pertinent modifications to the microbiome during infancy offers significant promise to improve human health. There is growing support for integrating the concept of ecosystem services (the provision of benefits from ecosystems to humans) in linking specific microbiome functions to human well-being. This framework is widely applied in conservation efforts of macro-ecosystems and offers a systematic approach to guide restoration actions aimed to recover critical ecological functions. The aim of this work is to apply the ecosystem services framework to integrate recent studies demonstrating stable alteration of the gut microbiome of breastfed infants when Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis EVC001, a gut symbiont capable of efficiently utilizing human milk oligosaccharides into organic acids that are beneficial for the infant and lower intestinal pH, is reintroduced. Additionally, using examples from the literature we illustrate how the absence of B. infantis results in diminished ecosystem services, which may be associated with health consequences related to immune and metabolic disorders. Finally, we propose a model by which infant gut dysbiosis can be defined as a reduction in ecosystem services supplied to the host by the gut microbiome rather than merely changes in diversity or taxonomic composition. Given the increased interest in targeted microbiome modification therapies to decrease acute and chronic disease risk, the model presented here provides a framework to assess the effectiveness of such strategies from a host-centered perspective.
