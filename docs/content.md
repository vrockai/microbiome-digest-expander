The literature of human and other host-associated microbiome studies is expanding rapidly, but systematic comparisons among published results of host-associated microbiome signatures of differential abundance remain difficult. We present BugSigDB, a community-editable database of manually curated microbial signatures from published differential abundance studies accompanied by information on study geography, health outcomes, host body site and experimental, epidemiological and statistical methods using controlled vocabulary. The initial release of the database contains &gt;2,500 manually curated signatures from &gt;600 published studies on three host species, enabling high-throughput analysis of signature similarity, taxon enrichment, co-occurrence and coexclusion and consensus signatures. These data allow assessment of microbiome differential abundance within and across experimental conditions, environments or body sites. Database-wide analysis reveals experimental conditions with the highest level of consistency in signatures reported by independent studies and identifies commonalities among disease-associated signatures, including frequent introgression of oral pathobionts into the gut.

## The oral microbiome: diversity, biogeography and human health.
 12.09.2023, _JL Baker, JL Mark Welch, KM Kauffman, JS McLean, X He_


The human oral microbiota is highly diverse and has a complex ecology, comprising bacteria, microeukaryotes, archaea and viruses. These communities have elaborate and highly structured biogeography that shapes metabolic exchange on a local scale and results from the diverse microenvironments present in the oral cavity. The oral microbiota also interfaces with the immune system of the human host and has an important role in not only the health of the oral cavity but also systemic health. In this Review, we highlight recent advances including novel insights into the biogeography of several oral niches at the species level, as well as the ecological role of candidate phyla radiation bacteria and non-bacterial members of the oral microbiome. In addition, we summarize the relationship between the oral microbiota and the pathology of oral diseases and systemic diseases. Together, these advances move the field towards a more holistic understanding of the oral microbiota and its role in health, which in turn opens the door to the study of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Oral diseases, such as periodontal disease and dental caries, have a high risk of recurrence and are considered to be related to dysbiosis of the oral microbiome and metabolome. It is, therefore, important to understand the state of the oral microbiome and metabolome after disease treatment to prevent recurrence. The current study sought to clarify whether oral dysbiosis improves the following remission of symptoms by dental treatment. To this end, the salivary microbiome and metabolome of healthy participants were compared to those with periodontal disease, dental caries, or both (concurrent). Saliva was collected as mouth-rinsed water and the microbiome was measured using 16S rRNA gene targeted sequencing and metabolome using capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Comparisons with healthy participants were performed before and after treatment, and several months after transition to self-care. Dental treatment significantly improved the oral health condition of each group; several months after treatment, oral health did not deteriorate. However, even after remission, the salivary microbiome of the two groups (oral disease and healthy) differed significantly. Additionally, after remission, significant differences, compared with healthy participants, remained in the relative abundances of disease-related bacteria and nitrate-reducing bacteria. After remission, significant differences were observed in the salivary metabolome in the healthy group in terms of threonate and pyrimidine metabolism-related component concentrations, which are assumed to reflect the high relative abundance of periodontal disease-related bacteria in the microbiome. Oral microbiome dysbiosis persisted even after dental treatment-induced disease remission with a sustained increased risk of disease when compared with healthy participants. IMPORTANCE We characterized the oral conditions, salivary microbiome, and metabolome after dental treatment by investigating the state after treatment completion and transition to self-care. Dental treatment improved oral health conditions, resulting in oral disease remission; however, the imbalanced state of the salivary microbiome continued even after remission. Although the results of this study are preliminary, owing to the small number of participants in each group when compared to larger cohort studies, they indicate that the risk of disease may remain higher than that of healthy participants, thereby demonstrating the importance of removing dental plaque containing disease-related bacteria using appropriate care even after treatment completion. We also identified bacterial species with relative abundances that differed from those of healthy participants even after remission of symptoms, which may indicate that the maturation of certain bacterial species must be controlled to improve the oral microbiome and reduce the risk of disease recurrence.

## Proton pump inhibitor treatment aggravates bacterial translocation in patients with advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
 25.08.2023, _L Sturm, M Hirose, L Stolz, M Schultheiss, K Zoldan, M Reincke, JP Huber, R Kaeser, T Boettler, R Thimme, E Albert, H Busch, A Künstner, D Bettinger_


Recent studies have linked proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment to increased complications of cirrhosis, such as bacterial infections and hepatic encephalopathy. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. The present study investigated the hypothesis that PPI treatment may promote adverse effects in patients with advanced cirrhosis by affecting subclinical bacterial translocation (BT) from the gut into the portal venous bloodstream. Blood samples from the portal vein were obtained during implantation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in a total of 80 cirrhosis patients with PPI treatment (PPI group, n = 57) and without PPI treatment (no-PPI group, n = 23). BT was identified using a 16S ribosomal RNA gene (V1V2 region) polymerase chain reaction. The microbiota composition in the portal venous blood samples was further analyzed by deep amplicon sequencing. Indeed, the prevalence of BT was significantly higher in the PPI group compared to the no-PPI group (86.0% vs 52.2%, P = 0.001). Importantly, this effect was not attributable to group differences in the severity of cirrhosis, parameters of portal hypertension, or medication. Microbiome analyses showed significantly increased alpha-diversity (Shannon) in the portal venous blood of the PPI group. Taxonomic analyses revealed significantly increased Streptococcus abundances in these patients. The present study reveals aggravated BT in patients with advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension receiving PPI therapy. Increased BT could be an important pathomechanism contributing to the adverse effects of PPI treatment in patients with cirrhosis. IMPORTANCE Long-term prescription of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients with cirrhosis is common practice. However, in recent years, several observational studies have reported increased complications and negative prognostic effects of PPI treatment in these patients. Judging the significance of these associations is complicated by the fact that a plausible underlying pathomechanism has not been identified so far. In the present study, we address this important issue by investigating the impact of PPI treatment on subclinical bacterial translocation from the gut into the blood stream in patients with advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Indeed, we report significantly aggravated bacterial translocation in cirrhosis patients receiving PPI treatment. This finding is highly relevant, as bacterial translocation is known to promote the development of complications and impair prognosis in patients with cirrhosis. Hence, the present study could establish a plausible link between PPI treatment and adverse effects in cirrhosis.

## A faecal metabolite signature of impaired fasting glucose: results from two independent population-based cohorts.
 12.09.2023, _A Nogal, F Tettamanzi, Q Dong, P Louca, A Visconti, C Christiansen, T Breuninger, J Linseisen, H Grallert, N Wawro, F Asnicar, K Wong, AF Baleanu, GA Michelotti, N Segata, M Falchi, A Peters, PW Franks, V Bagnardi, TD Spector, JT Bell, C Gieger, AM Valdes, C Menni_


Prediabetes is a metabolic condition associated with gut microbiome composition, though mechanisms remain elusive. We searched for faecal metabolites, a readout of gut microbiome function, associated with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in 142 individuals with IFG and 1105 healthy individuals from TwinsUK. We used the KORA cohort (318 IFG individuals, 689 healthy individuals) to replicate our findings. We linearly combined 8 IFG-positively associated metabolites (1-methylxantine, nicotinate, glucuronate, uridine, cholesterol, serine, caffeine and protoporphyrin IX) into an IFG-metabolite score, which was significantly associated with higher odds ratios for IFG (TwinsUK: OR[95%CI]=3.9[3.02-5.02], p&lt;0.0001, KORA: OR[95%CI]=1.3[1.16-1.52], p&lt;0.0001) and incident type-2 diabetes (T2D) (TwinsUK: HR[95%CI]=4[1.97-8], p=0.0002). Although these are host-produced metabolites, we found that the gut microbiome is strongly associated with their faecal levels (AUC&gt;70%). Abundances of Faecalibacillus intestinalis, Dorea formicigenerans, Ruminococcus torques and Dorea sp. AF24_7LB were positively associated with IFG, and such associations were partially mediated by 1-methylxanthine and nicotinate (VAF mean(SD)=14.4%(5.1), p&lt;0.05). Our results suggest that gut microbiome is linked to prediabetes not only via the production of microbial metabolites but also by affecting intestinal absorption/excretion of host-produced metabolites and xenobiotics, which are correlated with the risk of IFG. Faecal metabolites enable modelling of another mechanism of gut microbiome effect on prediabetes and T2D onset.

## Composition and functional profiles of gut microbiota reflect the treatment stage, severity, and etiology of acute pancreatitis.
 12.09.2023, _Z Wang, M Guo, J Li, C Jiang, S Yang, S Zheng, M Li, X Ai, X Xu, W Zhang, X He, Y Wang, Y Chen_


Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a type of digestive system disease with high mortality. Previous studies have shown that gut microbiota can participate in developing and treating acute pancreatitis by affecting the host's metabolism. In this study, we followed 20 AP patients to generate longitudinal gut microbiota profiles and activity during disease (before treatment, on the third day of treatment, and 1 month after discharge). We analyzed species composition and metabolic pathways' changes across the treatment phase, severity, and etiology. The diversity of the gut microbiome of patients with AP did not show much variation with treatment. In contrast, the metabolic functions of the gut microbiota, such as the essential chemical reactions that produce energy and maintain life, were partially reinstated after treatment. The severe AP (SAP) patients contained less beneficial bacteria (i.e., Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Clostridium lavalense, and Roseburia inulinivorans) and weaker sugar degradation function than mild AP patients before treatment. Moreover, etiology was one of the drivers of gut microbiome composition and explained the 3.54% variation in species' relative abundance. The relative abundance of pathways related to lipid synthesis was higher in the gut of hyperlipidemia AP patients than in biliary AP patients. The composition and functional profiles of the gut microbiota reflect the severity and etiology of AP. Otherwise, we also identified bacterial species associated with SAP, i.e., Oscillibacter sp. 57_20, Parabacteroides johnsonii, Bacteroides stercoris, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Ruminococcus lactaris, Coprococcus comes, and Dorea formicigenerans, which have the potential to identify the SAP at an early stage. IMPORTANCE Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a type of digestive system disease with high mortality. Previous studies have shown that gut microbiota can participate in the development and treatment of acute pancreatitis by affecting the host's metabolism. However, fewer studies acquired metagenomic sequencing data to associate species to functions intuitively and performed longitudinal analysis to explore how gut microbiota influences the development of AP. We followed 20 AP patients to generate longitudinal gut microbiota profiles and activity during disease and studied the differences in intestinal flora under different severities and etiologies. We have two findings. First, the gut microbiota profile has the potential to identify the severity and etiology of AP at an early stage. Second, gut microbiota likely acts synergistically in the development of AP. This study provides a reference for characterizing the driver flora of severe AP to identify the severity of acute pancreatitis at an early stage.

## Specific pathway abundances in the neonatal calf faecal microbiome are associated with susceptibility to Cryptosporidium parvum infection: a metagenomic analysis.
 12.09.2023, _MF Hares, BE Griffiths, F Johnson, C Nelson, S Haldenby, CJ Stewart, JS Duncan, G Oikonomou, JL Coombes_


Cryptosporidium parvum is the main cause of calf scour worldwide. With limited therapeutic options and research compared to other Apicomplexa, it is important to understand the parasites' biology and interactions with the host and microbiome in order to develop novel strategies against this infection. The age-dependent nature of symptomatic cryptosporidiosis suggests a link to the undeveloped immune response, the immature intestinal epithelium, and its associated microbiota. This led us to hypothesise that specific features of the early life microbiome could predict calf susceptibility to C. parvum infection.

## Phage-microbe dynamics after sterile faecal filtrate transplantation in individuals with metabolic syndrome: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing efficacy and safety.
 12.09.2023, _K Wortelboer, PA de Jonge, TPM Scheithauer, I Attaye, EM Kemper, M Nieuwdorp, H Herrema_


Bacteriophages (phages) are bacterial viruses that have been shown to shape microbial communities. Previous studies have shown that faecal virome transplantation can decrease weight gain and normalize blood glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice. Therefore, we performed a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study in which 24 individuals with metabolic syndrome were randomised to a faecal filtrate transplantation (FFT) from a lean healthy donor (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12). The primary outcome, change in glucose metabolism, and secondary outcomes, safety and longitudinal changes within the intestinal bacteriome and phageome, were assessed from baseline up to 28 days. All 24 included subjects completed the study and are included in the analyses. While the overall changes in glucose metabolism are not significantly different between both groups, the FFT is well-tolerated and without any serious adverse events. The phage virion composition is significantly altered two days after FFT as compared to placebo, which coincides with more virulent phage-microbe interactions. In conclusion, we provide evidence that gut phages can be safely administered to transiently alter the gut microbiota of recipients.

## Different bacterial and fungal community patterns in restored habitats in coal-mining subsidence areas.
 12.09.2023, _Y Wang, G Zheng, Y Zhao, H Bo, C Li, J Dong, Y Wang, S Yan, F Zhang, J Liu_


Soil microbiota, which plays a fundamental role in ecosystem functioning, is sensitive to environmental changes. Studying soil microbial ecological patterns can help to understand the consequences of environmental disturbances on soil microbiota and hence ecosystem services. The different habitats with critical environmental gradients generated through the restoration of coal-mining subsidence areas provide an ideal area to explore the response of soil microbiota to environmental changes. Here, based on high-throughput sequencing, we revealed the patterns of soil bacterial and fungal communities in habitats with different land-use types (wetland, farmland, and grassland) and with different restored times which were generated during the ecological restoration of a typical coal-mining subsidence area in Jining City, China. The α-diversity of bacterial was higher in wetland than in farmland and grassland, while that of fungi had no discrepancy among the three habitats. The β-diversity of bacterial community in the grassland was lower than in the farmland, and fungal community was significant different in all three habitats, showing wetland, grassland, and farmland from high to low. The β-diversity of the bacterial community decreased with restoration time while that of the fungal community had no significant change in the longer-restoration-time area. Furthermore, soil electrical conductivity was the most important driver for both bacterial and fungal communities. Based on the taxonomic difference among different habitats, we identified a group of biomarkers for each habitat. The study contributes to understand the microbial patterns during the ecological restoration of coal-mining subsidence areas, which has implications for the efficient ecological restoration of subsidence areas.
