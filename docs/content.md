Men demonstrate higher incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) than women. This study aims to explain the potential causes of such sexual dimorphism in CRC from the perspective of sex-biased gut microbiota and metabolites. The results show that sexual dimorphism in colorectal tumorigenesis is observed in both ApcMin/ + mice and azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice with male mice have significantly larger and more tumors, accompanied by more impaired gut barrier function. Moreover, pseudo-germ mice receiving fecal samples from male mice or patients show more severe intestinal barrier damage and higher level of inflammation. A significant change in gut microbiota composition is found with increased pathogenic bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila and deplets probiotic Parabacteroides goldsteinii in both male mice and pseudo-germ mice receiving fecal sample from male mice. Sex-biased gut metabolites in pseudo-germ mice receiving fecal sample from CRC patients or CRC mice contribute to sex dimorphism in CRC tumorigenesis through glycerophospholipids metabolism pathway. Sexual dimorphism in tumorigenesis of CRC mouse models. In conclusion, the sex-biased gut microbiome and metabolites contribute to sexual dimorphism in CRC. Modulating sex-biased gut microbiota and metabolites could be a potential sex-targeting therapeutic strategy of CRC.

## Dietary pattern in autism increases the need for probiotic supplementation: A comprehensive narrative and systematic review on oxidative stress hypothesis.
 07.07.2023, _M Zarezadeh, M Mahmoudinezhad, B Hosseini, L Khorraminezhad, M Razaghi, E Alvandi, A Saedisomeolia_


Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are associated with specific dietary habits, including limited food selection and gastrointestinal problems, resulting in an altered gut microbiota. Autistic patients have an elevated abundance of certain gut bacteria associated with increased oxidative stress in the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotic supplementation has been shown to decrease oxidative stress in a simulated gut model, but the antioxidant effects of probiotics on the oxidative stress of the gut in autistic patients have not been directly studied. However, it is speculated that probiotic supplementation may help decrease oxidative stress in the gastrointestinal tract of autistic patients due to their specific dietary habits altering the microbiota. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases and Google Scholar were searched up to May 2023. This systematic-narrative review aims to present the latest evidence regarding the changes in eating habits of autistic children which may further increase the gut microbiota induced oxidative stress. Additionally, this review will assess the available literature on the effects of probiotic supplementation on oxidative stress parameters.

## Early-life respiratory infections and developmental immunity determine lifelong lung health.
 06.07.2023, _CM Lloyd, S Saglani_


Respiratory infections are common in infants and young children. However, the immune system develops and matures as the child grows, thus the effects of infection during this time of dynamic change may have long-term consequences. The infant immune system develops in conjunction with the seeding of the microbiome at the respiratory mucosal surface, at a time that the lungs themselves are maturing. We are now recognizing that any disturbance of this developmental trajectory can have implications for lifelong lung health. Here, we outline our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying relationships between immune and structural cells in the lung with the local microorganisms. We highlight the importance of gaining greater clarity as to what constitutes a healthy respiratory ecosystem and how environmental exposures influencing this network will aid efforts to mitigate harmful effects and restore lung immune health.

## Ecoevolutionary processes structure milk microbiomes across the mammalian tree of life.

Milk production is an ancient adaptation that unites all mammals. Milk contains a microbiome that can contribute to offspring health and microbial-immunological development. We generated a comprehensive milk microbiome dataset (16S rRNA gene) for the class Mammalia, representing 47 species from all placental superorders, to determine processes structuring milk microbiomes. We show that across Mammalia, milk exposes offspring to maternal bacterial and archaeal symbionts throughout lactation. Deterministic processes of environmental selection accounted for 20% of milk microbiome assembly processes; milk microbiomes were similar from mammals with the same host superorder (Afrotheria, Laurasiathera, Euarchontoglires, and Xenarthra: 6%), environment (marine captive, marine wild, terrestrial captive, and terrestrial wild: 6%), diet (carnivore, omnivore, herbivore, and insectivore: 5%), and milk nutrient content (sugar, fat, and protein: 3%). We found that diet directly and indirectly impacted milk microbiomes, with indirect effects being mediated by milk sugar content. Stochastic processes, such as ecological drift, accounted for 80% of milk microbiome assembly processes, which was high compared to mammalian gut and mammalian skin microbiomes (69% and 45%, respectively). Even amid high stochasticity and indirect effects, our results of direct dietary effects on milk microbiomes provide support for enteromammary trafficking, representing a mechanism by which bacteria are transferred from the mother's gut to mammary gland and then to offspring postnatally. The microbial species present in milk reflect both selective pressures and stochastic processes at the host level, exemplifying various ecological and evolutionary factors acting on milk microbiomes, which, in turn, set the stage for offspring health and development.

## Shared Evolutionary Path in Social Microbiomes.
 13.07.2023, _N Frazão, I Gordo_


Social networks can influence the ecology of gut bacteria, shaping the species composition of the gut microbiome in humans and other animals. Gut commensals evolve and can adapt at a rapid pace when colonizing healthy hosts. Here, we aimed at assessing the impact of host-to-host bacterial transmission on Escherichia coli evolution in the mammalian gut. Using an in vivo experimental evolution approach in mice, we found a transmission rate of 7% (±3% 2× standard error [2SE]) of E. coli cells per day between hosts inhabiting the same household. Consistent with the predictions of a simple population genetics model of mutation-selection-migration, the level of shared events resulting from within host evolution is greatly enhanced in cohoused mice, showing that hosts undergoing the same diet and habit are not only expected to have similar microbiome species compositions but also similar microbiome evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, we estimated the rate of mutation accumulation of E. coli to be 3.0 × 10-3 (±0.8 × 10-3 2SE) mutations/genome/generation, irrespective of the social context of the regime. Our results reveal the impact of bacterial migration across hosts in shaping the adaptive evolution of new strains colonizing gut microbiomes.

## Use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
 06.07.2023, _L Rong, D Ch'ng, P Jia, KKF Tsoi, SH Wong, JJY Sung_


Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) exhibit compositional changes in their gut microbiome, which represents a potential therapeutic target. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are microbiome-targeted therapies that have been proposed as treatment for NAFLD. We aim to systematically review the effects of these therapies in liver-related outcomes of NAFLD patients.
