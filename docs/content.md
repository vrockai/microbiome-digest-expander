## Crosstalk between gut microbiome and neuroinflammation in pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder.
 23.01.2024, _X Chen, J Wei, Y Zhang, Y Zhang, T Zhang_


HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) has become a chronic neurodegenerative disease affecting the quality of life in people living with HIV (PLWH). Despite an established association between HAND and neuroinflammation induced by HIV proteins (gp120, Tat, Rev., Nef, and Vpr), the pathogenesis of HAND remains to be fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that the gut microbiome is emerging as a critical regulator of various neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease), suggesting that the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and neuroinflammation may contribute to the development of these diseases, for example, gut dysbiosis and microbiota-derived metabolites can trigger inflammation in the brain. However, the potential role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of HAND remains largely unexplored. In this review, we aim to discuss and elucidate the HAND pathogenesis correlated with gut microbiome and neuroinflammation, and intend to explore the probable intervention strategies for HAND.

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial barrier function. Although multiple studies have demonstrated the significance of dietary factors on gut microbiota and mucosal barrier function, the impact of a purified diet, which has long been used in various animal experiments, on intestinal homeostasis remains to be elucidated. Here, we compared the impact of two different types of diets, a crude diet and an AIN-93G-formula purified diet, on epithelial integrity and the gut microbiota. Purified diet-fed mice exhibited shorter villi and crypt lengths and slower epithelial turnover, particularly in the ileum. In addition, antimicrobial products, including islet-derived protein 3γ (REG3γ), were substantially decreased in purified diet-fed mice. Purified diet feeding also suppressed α1,2-fucosylation on the epithelial surface. Furthermore, purified diet induced metabolic rewiring to fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the ileal contents and mucus layer revealed distinct gut microbiota compositions between the purified and crude diet-fed mice. Purified diet feeding reduced the abundance of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which potently upregulate REG3γ and fucosyltransferase 2 (Fut2) by stimulating group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) to produce IL-22. These observations illustrate that the intake of a crude diet secures epithelial barrier function by facilitating SFB colonization, whereas a purified diet insufficiently establishes the epithelial barrier, at least partly owing to the loss of SFB. Our data suggest that the influence of purified diets on the epithelial barrier integrity should be considered in experiments using purified diets.

## A snapshot of gut microbiota of an adult urban population from Western region of India.

The human gut microbiome contributes to a broad range of biochemical and metabolic functions that directly or indirectly affect human physiology. Several recent studies have indicated that factors like age, geographical location, genetic makeup, and individual health status significantly influence the diversity, stability, and resilience of the gut microbiome. Of the mentioned factors, geographical location (and related dietary/socio-economic context) appears to explain a significant portion of microbiome variation observed in various previously conducted base-line studies on human gut microbiome. Given this context, we have undertaken a microbiome study with the objective of cataloguing the taxonomic diversity of gut microbiomes sampled from an urban cohort from Ahmedabad city in Western India. Computational analysis of microbiome sequence data corresponding to 160 stool samples (collected from 80 healthy individuals at two time-points, 60 days apart) has indicated a Prevotella-dominated microbial community. Given that the typical diet of participants included carbohydrate and fibre-rich components (predominantly whole grains and legume-based preparations), results appear to validate the proposed correlation between diet/geography and microbiome composition. Comparative analysis of obtained gut microbiome profiles with previously published microbiome profiles from US, China, Finland, and Japan additionally reveals a distinct taxonomic and (inferred) functional niche for the sampled microbiomes.

## Causal relationship between gut microbiota and gastrointestinal diseases: a mendelian randomization study.
 23.01.2024, _K Wu, Q Luo, Y Liu, A Li, D Xia, X Sun_


Recent research increasingly highlights a strong correlation between gut microbiota and the risk of gastrointestinal diseases. However, whether this relationship is causal or merely coincidental remains uncertain. To address this, a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was undertaken to explore the connections between gut microbiota and prevalent gastrointestinal diseases.

## VLP-Based Model for Study of Airborne Viral Pathogens.
 23.01.2024, _M Caffrey, N Jayakumar, V Caffrey, V Anirudan, L Rong, I Paprotny_


The recent COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the danger of airborne viral pathogens. The lack of model systems to study airborne pathogens limits the understanding of airborne pathogen distribution, as well as potential surveillance and mitigation strategies. In this work, we develop a novel model system to study airborne pathogens using virus like particles (VLP). Specifically, we demonstrate the ability to aerosolize VLP and detect and quantify aerosolized VLP RNA by Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) in real-time fluorescent and colorimetric assays. Importantly, the VLP model presents many advantages for the study of airborne viral pathogens: (i) similarity in size and surface components; (ii) ease of generation and noninfectious nature enabling study of BSL3 and BSL4 viruses; (iii) facile characterization of aerosolization parameters; (iv) ability to adapt the system to other viral envelope proteins including those of newly discovered pathogens and mutant variants; (v) the ability to introduce viral sequences to develop nucleic acid amplification assays.

## Microbiome-based correction of nutrient profiles derived from self-reported dietary assessments.
 18.12.2023, _T Wang, Y Fu, M Shuai, JS Zheng, L Zhu, Q Sun, FB Hu, ST Weiss, YY Liu_


Since dietary intake is hard to directly measure in large-scale cohort studies, we often rely on self-reported instruments (e.g., food frequency questionnaires, diet recall surveys, and diet diary methods) developed in nutritional epidemiology. Those self-reported instruments are prone to measurement errors. The measurement errors eventually lead to inaccuracies in the calculation of nutrient profiles. Currently, there is a lack of computational methods to address this problem. To fill the gap, we introduce a deep-learning approach --- Microbiome-based nutrient profile corrector (METRIC), which leverages gut microbial compositions to correct the errors in nutrient profiles due to measurement errors in self-reported dietary assessments. We demonstrate the excellent performance of METRIC in minimizing the simulated random errors in both synthetic and three real-world datasets. METRIC has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of self-reported dietary assessments and hence facilitate the research of nutritional epidemiology.
