## Gut Microbial Metabolites and Blood Pressure Regulation: Focus on SCFAs and TMAO.
 04.06.2020, _BG Poll, MU Cheema, JL Pluznick_


Shifts in the gut microbiome play a key role in blood pressure regulation, and changes in the production of gut microbial metabolites are likely to be a key mechanism. Known gut microbial metabolites include short-chain fatty acids, which can signal via G-protein-coupled receptors, and trimethylamine-N oxide. In this review, we provide an overview of gut microbial metabolites documented thus far to play a role in blood pressure regulation.

## Well-maintained patients with a history of periodontitis still harbor a more disbiotic microbiome than health.
 03.06.2020, _H Lu, L He, J Xu, W Song, X Feng, Y Zhao, H Meng_


It remains unclear whether well-maintained subjects, with periodontitis in the past, effectively treated, and maintained for a long time, have the same subgingival microbiome as healthy subjects. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the characteristics of the subgingival microbiome in well-maintained patients with a history of periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
