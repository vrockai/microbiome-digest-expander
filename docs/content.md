We aimed to investigate whether the gut microbiota and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with skeletal muscle mass and strength in healthy Chinese children aged 6-9 years. In this study, 412 children were enrolled. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the gut microbiota compositions. Fecal SCFAs were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Dual X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure the total body lean soft tissue mass (TSM), total body fat mass (TBF), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), and appendicular fat mass (AFM). TSM/height2 (TSMI), ASM/height2 (ASMI), TSM/weight (TSMR), ASM/weight (ASMR), and the ratio of TSM/TBF and ASM/AFM were calculated. Handgrip strength (HGS) was measured using the Jamar® Plus+ Hand Dynamometer. A multiple regression analysis after adjustment for covariates and multiple test correction showed some operational taxonomic units in partial least squares models identified by Multivariate methods with Unbiased Variable selection analysis such as genera of Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-004 were positively correlated with at least one measure of TSM, TSMI, ASM, ASMI, and ASMI Z-score (β: 0.103-0.143, pFDR : .008-.032) but negatively correlated with at least one measure of TSMR, TSM/TBF, ASMR, ASM/AFM, and ASMR Z-score (β: -0.185 to 0.124, pFDR = .008-.045). Children with higher fecal butyric acid, acetic acid, and total SCFA levels exhibited higher TSM, ASM, TSMI, ASMI, and ASMI Z-score and lower TSM/TBF, ASM/AFM, TSMR, ASMR, and ASMR Z-score. However, after additional adjustment for TBF or body mass index, only the associations for Faecalitalea and Pyramidobacter still existed. Mediation analysis suggested that total body fat significantly mediated 66.3%-95.3% of the estimated association of microbiota and SCFAs with TSM, ASM, and ASMI Z-score. Our results suggest that the associations of gut microbiota and SCFAs with skeletal muscle quality in children may largely depend upon on total body fat content.

## Characteristics of Fecal Microbiota and Machine Learning Strategy for Fecal Invasive Biomarkers in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
 25.12.2021, _X Wang, Y Xiao, X Xu, L Guo, Y Yu, N Li, C Xu_


Early diagnosis and treatment of pediatric Inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) is challenging due to the complexity of the disease and lack of disease specific biomarkers. The novel machine learning (ML) technique may be a useful tool to provide a new route for the identification of early biomarkers for the diagnosis of PIBD.

## Gut Microbiota Exceeds Cervical Microbiota for Early Diagnosis of Endometriosis.
 25.12.2021, _L Huang, B Liu, Z Liu, W Feng, M Liu, Y Wang, D Peng, X Fu, H Zhu, Z Cui, L Xie, Y Ma_


The diagnosis of endometriosis is typically delayed by years for the unexclusive symptom and the traumatic diagnostic method. Several studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota and cervical mucus potentially can be used as auxiliary diagnostic biomarkers. However, none of the previous studies has compared the robustness of endometriosis classifiers based on microbiota of different body sites or demonstrated the correlation among microbiota of gut, cervical mucus, and peritoneal fluid of endometriosis, searching for alternative diagnostic approaches. Herein, we enrolled 41 women (control, n = 20; endometriosis, n = 21) and collected 122 well-matched samples, derived from feces, cervical mucus, and peritoneal fluid, to explore the nature of microbiome of endometriosis patients. Our results indicated that microbial composition is remarkably distinguished between three body sites, with 19 overlapped taxa. Moreover, endometriosis patients harbor distinct microbial communities versus control group especially in feces and peritoneal fluid, with increased abundance of pathogens in peritoneal fluid and depletion of protective microbes in feces. Particularly, genera of Ruminococcus and Pseudomonas were identified as potential biomarkers in gut and peritoneal fluid, respectively. Furthermore, novel endometriosis classifiers were constructed based on taxa selected by a robust machine learning method. These results demonstrated that gut microbiota exceeds cervical microbiota in diagnosing endometriosis. Collectively, this study reveals important insights into the microbial profiling in different body sites of endometriosis, which warrant future exploration into the role of microbiota in endometriosis and highlighted values on gut microbiota in early diagnosis of endometriosis.

## Natural selection for imprecise vertical transmission in host-microbiota systems.
 03.01.2022, _M Bruijning, LP Henry, SKG Forsberg, CJE Metcalf, JF Ayroles_


How and when the microbiome modulates host adaptation remains an evolutionary puzzle, despite evidence that the extended genetic repertoire of the microbiome can shape host phenotypes and fitness. One complicating factor is that the microbiome is often transmitted imperfectly across host generations, leading to questions about the degree to which the microbiome contributes to host adaptation. Here, using an evolutionary model, we demonstrate that decreasing vertical transmission fidelity can increase microbiome variation, and thus phenotypic variation, across hosts. When the most beneficial microbial genotypes change unpredictably from one generation to the next (for example, in variable environments), hosts can maximize fitness by increasing the microbiome variation among offspring, as this improves the chance of there being an offspring with the right microbial combination for the next generation. Imperfect vertical transmission can therefore be adaptive in varying environments. We characterize how selection on vertical transmission is shaped by environmental conditions, microbiome changes during host development and the contribution of other factors to trait variation. We illustrate how environmentally dependent microbial effects can favour intermediate transmission and set our results in the context of examples from natural systems. We also suggest research avenues to empirically test our predictions. Our model provides a basis to understand the evolutionary pathways that potentially led to the wide diversity of microbe transmission patterns found in nature.

The airway microbiota is important in chronic suppurative lung diseases, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF). This comparison has not previously been described but is important because difference between the two diseases may relate to the differing prognoses and lead to pathological insights and potentially, new treatments.

## Comparative Study of Intestinal Microbiota Composition of Six Edible Fish Species.
 25.12.2021, _T Ofek, M Lalzar, S Laviad-Shitrit, I Izhaki, M Halpern_


Intensive freshwater aquaculture in the Spring Valley, Israel, is implemented mainly in earthen fishponds and reservoirs that are stocked with a variety of edible fish species. Here we sampled six different healthy fish species from these intensive aquacultures. The fish were hybrid striped bass, European bass, red drum (all carnivores), hybrid tilapia, flathead grey mullet (both herbivores), and common carp (an omnivore). Significant differences were found among the intestinal microbiota of the six studied fish species. The microbiota composition diversity was strongly related to the trophic level of the fish, such that there was a significant difference between the carnivore and the herbivore species, while the omnivore species was not significantly different from either group. The most abundant genus in the majority of the fishes' intestinal microbiota was Cetobacterium. Furthermore, we found that beside Cetobacterium, a unique combination of taxa with relative abundance &gt;10% characterized the intestine microbiota of each fish species: unclassified Mycoplasmataceae, Aeromonas, and Vibrio (hybrid striped bass); Turicibacter and Clostridiaceae 1 (European bass); Vibrio (red drum); ZOR0006-Firmicutes (hybrid tilapia); unclassified Mycoplasmataceae and unclassified Vibrionaceae (flathead grey mullet); and Aeromonas (common carp). We conclude that each fish species has a specific bacterial genera combination that characterizes it. Moreover, diet and the trophic level of the fish have a major influence on the gut microbiota of healthy fish that grow in intensive freshwater aquaculture.

## Assessment of Changes in the Oral Microbiome That Occur in Dogs with Periodontal Disease.
 26.12.2021, _R Santibáñez, C Rodríguez-Salas, C Flores-Yáñez, D Garrido, P Thomson_


The oral microbiome in dogs is a complex community. Under some circumstances, it contributes to periodontal disease, a prevalent inflammatory disease characterized by a complex interaction between oral microbes and the immune system. Porphyromonas and Tannerella spp. are usually dominant in this disease. How the oral microbiome community is altered in periodontal disease, especially sub-dominant microbial populations is unclear. Moreover, how microbiome functions are altered in this disease has not been studied. In this study, we compared the composition and the predicted functions of the microbiome of the cavity of healthy dogs to those with from periodontal disease. The microbiome of both groups clustered separately, indicating important differences. Periodontal disease resulted in a significant increase in Bacteroidetes and reductions in Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Porphyromonas abundance increased 2.7 times in periodontal disease, accompanied by increases in Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. It was predicted that aerobic respiratory processes are decreased in periodontal disease. Enrichment in fermentative processes and anaerobic glycolysis were suggestive of an anaerobic environment, also characterized by higher lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. This study contributes to a better understanding of how periodontal disease modifies the oral microbiome and makes a prediction of the metabolic pathways that contribute to the inflammatory process observed in periodontal disease.

## Evaluation of Microbiome Alterations Following Consumption of BIOHM, a Novel Probiotic.
 24.12.2021, _MA Ghannoum, TS McCormick, M Retuerto, G Bebek, S Cousineau, L Hartman, C Barth, K Schrom_


Gastrointestinal microbiome dysbiosis may result in harmful effects on the host, including those caused by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The novel probiotic BIOHM, consisting of Bifidobacterium breve, Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, and amylase, was developed to rebalance the bacterial-fungal gut microbiome, with the goal of reducing inflammation and maintaining a healthy gut population. To test the effect of BIOHM on human subjects, we enrolled a cohort of 49 volunteers in collaboration with the Fermentation Festival group (Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The profiles of gut bacterial and fungal communities were assessed via stool samples collected at baseline and following 4 weeks of once-a-day BIOHM consumption. Mycobiome analysis following probiotic consumption revealed an increase in Ascomycota levels in enrolled individuals and a reduction in Zygomycota levels (p value &lt; 0.01). No statistically significant difference in Basidiomycota was detected between pre- and post-BIOHM samples and control abundance profiles (p &gt; 0.05). BIOHM consumption led to a significant reduction in the abundance of Candida genus in tested subjects (p value &lt; 0.013), while the abundance of C. albicans also trended lower than before BIOHM use, albeit not reaching statistical significance. A reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level was observed following BIOHM use, which approached levels reported for control individuals reported in the Human Microbiome Project data. The preliminary results from this clinical study suggest that BIOHM is capable of significantly rebalancing the bacteriome and mycobiome in the gut of healthy individuals, suggesting that further trials examining the utility of the BIOHM probiotic in individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms, where dysbiosis is considered a source driving pathogenesis, are warranted.
