## Unveiling the Hidden Theatre of Microbes.
 01.09.2020, _T Böttcher_


The chemical interactions of microbes shape and structure their communities and have important effects on the health and diseases of multicellular hosts. This special collection on Microbial Biosynthesis and Interactions sheds light on some of these interactions and takes a closer look at the molecules involved in them.

## Chitosan-chelated zinc modulates cecal microbiota and attenuates inflammatory response in weaned rats challenged with Escherichia coli.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection is very common among young growing animals, and zinc supplementation is often used to alleviate inflammation induced by this disease. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether chitosan-chelated zinc (CS-Zn) supplementation could attenuate gut injury induced by E. coli challenge and to explore how CS-Zn modulates cecal microbiota and alleviates intestinal inflammation in weaned rats challenged with E. coli. 36 weaned rats (55.65 ± 2.18 g of BW, n = 12) were divided into three treatment groups consisting of unchallenged rats fed a basal diet (Control) and two groups of rats challenged with E. coli and fed a basal diet or a diet containing 640 mg/kg CS-Zn (E. coli + CS-Zn, containing 50 mg/kg Zn) for a 14-day experiment. On days 10 to 12, each rat was given 4 ml of E. coli solution with a total bacteria count of 1010 CFU by oral gavage daily or normal saline of equal dosage. CS-Zn supplementation mitigated intestinal morphology impairment (e.g. higher crypt depth and lower macroscopic damage index) induced by E. coli challenge (P &lt; 0.05), and alleviated the increase of Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity after E. coli challenge (P &lt; 0.05). 16S rRNA sequencing analyses revealed that E. coli challenge significantly increased the abundance of Verrucomicrobia and E. coli (P &lt; 0.05). However, CS-Zn supplementation increased the abundance of Lactobacillus and decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Desulfovibrio and E. coli (P &lt; 0.05). The concentrations of butyrate in the cecal digesta, which decreased due to the challenge, were higher in the E. coli + CS-Zn group (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, CS-Zn supplementation significantly prevented the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 concentration and up-regulated the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 in cecal mucosa induced by E. coli infection (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, these results indicate that CS-Zn produces beneficial effects in alleviating gut mucosal injury of E. coli challenged rats by enhancing the intestinal morphology and modulating cecal bacterial composition, as well as attenuating inflammatory response.

## Potential Associations Among Alteration of Salivary miRNAs, Saliva Microbiome Structure, and Cognitive Impairments in Autistic Children.

Recent evidence has demonstrated that salivary molecules, as well as bacterial populations, can be perturbed by several pathological conditions, including neuro-psychiatric diseases. This relationship between brain functionality and saliva composition could be exploited to unveil new pathological mechanisms of elusive diseases, such as Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We performed a combined approach of miRNA expression profiling by NanoString technology, followed by validation experiments in qPCR, and 16S rRNA microbiome analysis on saliva from 53 ASD and 27 neurologically unaffected control (NUC) children. MiR-29a-3p and miR-141-3p were upregulated, while miR-16-5p, let-7b-5p, and miR-451a were downregulated in ASD compared to NUCs. Microbiome analysis on the same subjects revealed that Rothia, Filifactor, Actinobacillus, Weeksellaceae, Ralstonia, Pasteurellaceae, and Aggregatibacter increased their abundance in ASD patients, while Tannerella, Moryella and TM7-3 decreased. Variations of both miRNAs and microbes were statistically associated to different neuropsychological scores related to anomalies in social interaction and communication. Among miRNA/bacteria associations, the most relevant was the negative correlation between salivary miR-141-3p expression and Tannerella abundance. MiRNA and microbiome dysregulations found in the saliva of ASD children are potentially associated with cognitive impairments of the subjects. Furthermore, a potential cross-talking between circulating miRNAs and resident bacteria could occur in saliva of ASD.

## The importance of airway and lung microbiome in the critically ill.
 01.09.2020, _I Martin-Loeches, R Dickson, A Torres, H Hanberger, J Lipman, M Antonelli, G de Pascale, F Bozza, JL Vincent, S Murthy, M Bauer, J Marshall, C Cilloniz, LD Bos_


During critical illness, there are a multitude of forces such as antibiotic use, mechanical ventilation, diet changes and inflammatory responses that could bring the microbiome out of balance. This so-called dysbiosis of the microbiome seems to be involved in immunological responses and may influence outcomes even in individuals who are not as vulnerable as a critically ill ICU population. It is therefore probable that dysbiosis of the microbiome is a consequence of critical illness and may, subsequently, shape an inadequate response to these circumstances.Bronchoscopic studies have revealed that the carina represents the densest site of bacterial DNA along healthy airways, with a tapering density with further bifurcations. This likely reflects the influence of micro-aspiration as the primary route of microbial immigration in healthy adults. Though bacterial DNA density grows extremely sparse at smaller airways, bacterial signal is still consistently detectable in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, likely reflecting the fact that lavage via a wedged bronchoscope samples an enormous surface area of small airways and alveoli. The dogma of lung sterility also violated numerous observations that long predated culture-independent microbiology.The body's resident microbial consortia (gut and/or respiratory microbiota) affect normal host inflammatory and immune response mechanisms. Disruptions in these host-pathogen interactions have been associated with infection and altered innate immunity.In this narrative review, we will focus on the rationale and current evidence for a pathogenic role of the lung microbiome in the exacerbation of complications of critical illness, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
