## SlRLK-like is a malectin-like domain protein affecting localization and abundance of LeEIX2 receptor resulting in suppression of EIX-induced immune responses.
 13.10.2020, _O Sussholz, L Pizarro, S Schuster, A Avni_


The first line of plant defence occurs when a plant pattern recognition receptor (PRR) recognizes microbe-associated molecular patterns. Plant PRRs are either receptor-like kinases (RLK), which have an extracellular domain for ligand binding, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain for activating downstream signalling, or receptor-like proteins (RLP), which share the same overall structure but lack an intracellular kinase domain. The tomato LeEIX2 is an RLP that binds ethylene-inducing xylanase (EIX), a fungal elicitor. To identify LeEIX2 receptor interactors, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen and found a tomato protein that we termed SlRLK-like. The interaction of LeEIX2 with SlRLK-like was verified using co-immunoprecipitation and a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. The defence responses induced by EIX were markedly reduced when SlRLK-like was over-expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana or Nicotiana tabacum, and mutation of slrlk-like using CRISPR/Cas9 increased EIX-induced ethylene production and SlACS2 (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase) gene expression in tomato. Co-expression of SlRLK-like with LeEIX2 led to a reduction in its abundance, apparently through an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation process. Notably, truncating SlRLK-like protein, revealed that the malectin-like domain is sufficient and essential for its function. Moreover, SlRLK-like associated with RLK FLS2 resulting in its degradation and concomitantly a reduction of flg22-induced burst of reactive oxygen species. In addition, SlRLK-like co-expression with other RLP, Ve1 and AtRLP23, also led to a reduction in their abundance. Our findings suggest that SlRLK-like leads to a decreased stability of various PRRs, leading to their abundance reduction and resulting in attenuation of defence responses.

## Comparison of the microbial communities of alpacas and sheep fed diets with three different ratios of corn stalk to concentrate.
 08.10.2020, _R Chao, C Xia, C Pei, W Huo, Q Liu, C Zhang, Y Ren_


The objective of this study was to investigate the characteristics of ruminal microbial communities of alpacas (Lama pacos) and sheep (Ovis aries) fed three diets with varying ratios of roughage (corn stalk) to concentrate, 3:7 (LS), 5:5 (MS) and 7:3 (HS). Six alpacas (one-year-old and weighing 29.5 ± 7.1 kg) and six sheep (one-year-old and weighing 27.9 ± 2.7 kg) were used in this study, in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square experiment. Total protozoa concentration was determined under the microscope; total fungi and methanogens were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and expressed as a percentage of total bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies; bacterial communities were investigated by targeted 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region) sequencing. The percentage of fungi was significantly higher in alpacas than in sheep under the LS diet, while the concentration of protozoa was significantly lower in alpacas under HS, MS and LS diets. The alpha diversity including Shannon, Chao l and ACE indices of bacterial communities was higher in alpacas than in sheep, under the LS diet. A total of 299 genera belonging to 22 phyla were observed in the forestomach of alpaca and sheep, with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes dominating both animal species. Phyla Armatimonadetes and Fusobacteria, as well as 64 genera, were detected only in alpacas, whereas phyla Acidobacteria and Nitrospira, as well as 44 genera, were found only in sheep. The abundance of cellulolytic bacteria, including Butyrivibrio and Pseudobutyrivibrio, was higher in alpacas than in sheep under all three diets. These differences in the forestomach microbial communities partly explained why alpacas displayed a higher poor-quality roughage digestibility, and a lower methane production. Results also revealed that the adverse effects of high-concentrate diets (70%) were lesser in alpacas than in sheep.

## 16S rRNA Gene Diversity in Ancient Gray and Pink Salt from San Simón Salt Mines in Tarija, Bolivia.
 09.10.2020, _WT Pecher, FL Martínez, P DasSarma, D Guzmán, S DasSarma_


DNA from 250 million-year-old pink and gray salts from mines in Tarija, Bolivia, subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and analysis provided evidence for similar but distinct prokaryotic communities. The results constitute a snapshot of archaeal and bacterial microorganisms in these remote and ancient salt deposits.
