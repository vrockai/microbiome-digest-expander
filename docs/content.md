In diagnosing bacterial infection, rapid bacterial identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) are critical to clinicians in order to provide an effective treatment in a timely manner. The gold standard, culture-based approach provides both ID and antimicrobial susceptibility but requires several days of turnaround time. Especially in polymicrobial infections, where there are more than one organisms interacting collectively that can complicate the treatment. Here, we demonstrate a rapid bacterial diagnostic approach that is capable of bacterial ID/AST in heterogeneous samples within less than 4 hours by using digital PCR (dPCR) and digital high-resolution melt via microfluidic devices. By utilizing dPCR, we are able to quantify amount of nucleic acid, which correlates to phenotypic responses of {\bf individual pathogens in a mixed sample and also shorten the required time of antibiotic exposure. In addition, we employ a machine learning algorithm to automatically identify bacterial species based on melt profiles of 16S rRNA gene.

A large amount of shale gas fracturing flowback fluid (FFBF) from the process of shale gas exploitation causes obvious ecological harm to health of soil and water. However, biological hazard of soil microbial populations by fracturing flowback fluid remains rarely reported. In this study, the microbiological compositions were assessed via analyzing diversity of microbial populations. The results showed significant differences between polluted soil by fracturing flowback fluid and unpolluted soil in different pH and temperature conditions. And then, the microbe-index of biological integrity (M-IBI) was used to evaluate the toxicity of the fracturing flowback fluid based on analysis of microbial integrity. The results showed that polluted soil lacks key microbial species known to be beneficial to soil health, including denitrifying bacteria and cellulose-decomposing bacteria, and 35 Â°C is a critical value for estimating poor and sub-healthy level of damage to microbial integrity by fracturing flowback fluid. Our results provide a valuable reference for the evaluation of soil damage by fracturing flowback fluid.

## The effects of physical decontamination methods on zirconia implant surfaces: a systematic review.
 10.11.2021, _NCP Tan, A Khan, E Antunes, CM Miller, D Sharma_


Peri-implantitis therapy and implant maintenance are fundamental practices to enhance the longevity of zirconia implants. However, the use of physical decontamination methods, including hand instruments, polishing devices, ultrasonic scalers, and laser systems, might damage the implant surfaces. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of physical decontamination methods on zirconia implant surfaces.
