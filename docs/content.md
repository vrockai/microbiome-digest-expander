Gut microbiota is a complex system that starts to take shape early in life. Several factors influence the rise of microbial gut colonization, such as term and mode of delivery, exposure to antibiotics, maternal diet, presence of siblings and family members, pets, genetics, local environment, and geographical location. Breastfeeding, complementary feeding, and later dietary patterns during infancy and toddlerhood are major players in the proper development of microbial communities. Nonetheless, if dysbiosis occurs, gut microbiota may remain impaired throughout life, leading to deleterious consequences, such as greater predisposition to non-communicable diseases, more susceptible immune system and altered gut-brain axis. Children with specific diseases (i.e., food allergies, inborn errors of metabolism, celiac disease) need a special formula and later a special diet, excluding certain foods or nutrients. We searched on PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Embase for relevant pediatric studies published over the last twenty years on gut microbiota dietary patterns and excluded case reports or series and letters. The aim of this review is to highlight the changes in the gut microbiota in infants and children fed with special formula or diets for therapeutic requirements and, its potential health implications, with respect to gut microbiota under standard diets.

## Interaction between microbiota and immunity and its implication in colorectal cancer.
 16.08.2022, _C Xing, Y Du, T Duan, K Nim, J Chu, HY Wang, RF Wang_


_Colitis, Colorectal Neoplasms, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Inflammation, Microbiota_
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the world. Besides genetic causes, colonic inflammation is one of the major risk factors for CRC development, which is synergistically regulated by multiple components, including innate and adaptive immune cells, cytokine signaling, and microbiota. The complex interaction between CRC and the gut microbiome has emerged as an important area of current CRC research. Metagenomic profiling has identified a number of prominent CRC-associated bacteria that are enriched in CRC patients, linking the microbiota composition to colitis and cancer development. Some microbiota species have been reported to promote colitis and CRC development in preclinical models, while a few others are identified as immune modulators to induce potent protective immunity against colitis and CRC. Mechanistically, microbiota regulates the activation of different immune cell populations, inflammation, and CRC via crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune signaling pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), type I interferon, and inflammasome. In this review, we provide an overview of the potential interactions between gut microbiota and host immunity and how their crosstalk could synergistically regulate inflammation and CRC, thus highlighting the potential roles and mechanisms of gut microbiota in the development of microbiota-based therapies to prevent or alleviate colitis and CRC.

## Patient-Reported Outcomes Correlate With Microbial Community Composition Independent of Mucosal Inflammation in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
 16.08.2022, _J Hellmann, A Ta, NJ Ollberding, R Bezold, K Lake, K Jackson, K Dirksing, E Bonkowski, DB Haslam, LA Denson_


Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) involve an aberrant host response to intestinal microbiota causing mucosal inflammation and gastrointestinal symptoms. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly important in clinical care and research. Our aim was to examine associations between PROs and fecal microbiota in patients 0 to 22 years of age with IBD.

Microorganisms are commonly detected in tumor tissues, and the species and abundance have been reported to affect cancer initiation, progression, and therapy. Host genetics have been associated with gut microbial abundances, while the relationships between genetic variants and the cancer microbiome still require systematic interrogation. Therefore, identification of cancer microbiome quantitative trait loci (mbQTL) across cancer types might elucidate the contributions of genetic variants to tumor development. Using genotype data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and microbial abundance levels from Kraken-derived data, we developed a computational pipeline to identify mbQTLs in 32 cancer types. This systematically identified 38,660 mbQTLs across cancers, ranging 50 in endometrial carcinoma to 3,133 in thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, a strong enrichment of mbQTLs was observed among transcription factor binding sites and chromatin regulatory elements, such as H3K27ac. Notably, mbQTLs were significantly enriched in cancer GWAS loci and explained an average of 2% of cancer heritability, indicating that mbQTLs could provide additional insights into cancer etiology. Correspondingly, 24,443 mbQTLs overlapping with GWAS linkage disequilibrium regions were identified. Survival analyses identified 318 mbQTLs associated with patient overall survival. Moreover, we uncovered 135,248 microbiome-immune infiltration associations and 166,603 microbiome-drug response associations that might provide clues for microbiome-based biomarkers. Finally, a user-friendly database, Cancer-mbQTL (http://canmbqtl.whu.edu.cn/#/), was constructed for users to browse, search, and download data of interest. This study provides a valuable resource for investigating the roles of genetics and microorganisms in human cancer.

The rate of gut inflammatory diseases is growing in modern society. Previously, we showed that caloric restriction (CR) shapes gut microbiota composition and diminishes the expression of inflammatory factors along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The current project aimed to assess whether prominent dietary restrictive approaches, including intermittent fasting (IF), fasting-mimicking diet (FMD), and ketogenic diet (KD) have a similar effect as CR. We sought to verify which of the restrictive dietary approaches is the most potent and if the molecular pathways responsible for the impact of the diets overlap. We characterized the impact of the diets in the context of several dietary restriction-related parameters, including immune status in the GI tract; microbiota and its metabolites; bile acids (BAs); gut morphology; as well as autophagy-, mitochondria-, and energy restriction-related parameters. The effects of the various diets are very similar, particularly between CR, IF, and FMD. The occurrence of a 50 kDa truncated form of occludin, the composition of the microbiota, and BAs distinguished KD from the other diets. Based on the results, we were able to provide a comprehensive picture of the impact of restrictive diets on the gut, indicating that restrictive protocols aimed at improving gut health may be interchangeable.

## High fat diets induce early changes in gut microbiota that may serve as markers of ulterior altered physiological and biochemical parameters related to metabolic syndrome. Effect of virgin olive oil in comparison to butter.

_Animals, Biomarkers, Butter, Diet, High-Fat, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Metabolic Syndrome, Mice, Olive Oil_
Butter and virgin olive oil (EVOO) are two fats differing in their degree of saturation and insaponifiable fraction. EVOO, enriched in polyphenols and other minority components, exerts a distinct effect on health. Using next generation sequencing, we have studied early and long-term effects of both types of fats on the intestinal microbiota of mice, finding significant differences between the two diets in the percentage of certain bacterial taxa, correlating with hormonal, physiological and metabolic parameters in the host. These correlations are not only concomitant, but most noticeably some of the changes detected in the microbial percentages at six weeks are correlating with changes in physiological values detected later, at twelve weeks. Desulfovibrionaceae/Desulfovibrio/D. sulfuricans stand out by presenting at six weeks a statistically significant higher percentage in the butter-fed mice with respect to the EVOO group, correlating with systolic blood pressure, food intake, water intake and insulin at twelve weeks. This not only suggests an early implication in the probability of developing altered physiological and biochemical responses later on in the host lifespan, but also opens the possibility of using this genus as a marker in the risk of suffering different pathologies in the future.

## Host-Specific Larval Lepidopteran Mortality to Pathogenic Serratia Mediated by Poor Diet.
 16.08.2022, _CJ Mason, M Peiffer, GW Felton, K Hoover_


Insect guts often harbor an abundance of bacteria. Many of these members are commensal, but some may emerge as opportunistic pathogens when the host is under stress. In this study, we evaluated how dietary nutritional concentration mediates a shift from commensal to pathogenic, and if host species influences those interactions. We used the lepidopterans (Noctuidae) fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), and corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea) as hosts and a Serratia strain initially isolated from healthy fall armyworm. Diet concentratoin was altered by bulk reduction in nutritional content with dilution using cellulose. Our experiments revealed that low nutrient diet increased mortality from Serratia for beet armyworm and corn earworm. However, for fall armyworm, little mortality was observed in any of the diet combinations. Dietary nutrition and oral inoculation with Serratia did not change the expression of two antimicrobial peptides in fall and beet armyworm, suggesting that other mechanisms that mediate mortality were involved. Our results have implications for how pathogens may persist as commensals in the digestive tract of insects. These findings also suggest that diet plays a very important role in the switch from commensal to pathogen. Finally, our data indicate that the host response to changing conditions is critical in determining if a pathogen may overtake its host and that these three lepidopteran species have different responses to enteric bacteria that are opportunistic pathogens.

## Chemical and microbial characterization of sugarcane mill mud for soil applications.
 18.08.2022, _M Uchimiya, AG Hay, J LeBlanc_


_Carbon, Nitrogen, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Saccharum, Soil, Soil Microbiology_
Sugarcane mill mud/filter cake is an activated sludge-like byproduct from the clarifier of a raw sugar production factory, where cane juice is heated to ≈90°C for 1-2 hr, after the removal of bagasse. Mill mud is enriched with organic carbon, nitrogen, and nutrient minerals; no prior report utilized 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbial composition. Mill mud could be applied to agricultural fields as biofertilizer to replace or supplement chemical fertilizers, and as bio-stimulant to replenish microorganisms and organic carbon depleted by erosion and post-harvest field burning. However, mill mud has historically caused waste management challenges in the United States. This study reports on the chemical and microbial (16S rRNA) characteristics for mill muds of diverse origin and ages. Chemical signature (high phosphorus) distinguished mill mud from bagasse (high carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio) and soil (high pH) samples of diverse geographical/environmental origins. Bacterial alpha diversity of all sample types (mill mud, bagasse, and soil) was inversely correlated with C/N. Firmicutes dominated the microbial composition of fresh byproducts (mill mud and bagasse) as-produced within the operating factory. Upon aging and environmental exposure, the microbial community of the byproducts diversified to resemble that of soils, and became dominated by varying proportions of other phyla such as Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomyces. In summary, chemical properties allowed grouping of sample types (mill mud, bagasse, and soil-like), and microbial diversity analyses visualized aging caused by outdoor exposures including soil amendment and composting. Results suggest that a transient turnover of microbiome by amendments shifts towards more resilient population governed by the chemistry of bulk soil.
