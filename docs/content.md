## The longitudinal and cross-sectional heterogeneity of the intestinal microbiota.
 27.08.2021, _BM Miller, MJ Liou, JY Lee, AJ Bäumler_


A central goal of microbiome research is to understand the factors that balance gut-associated microbial communities, thereby creating longitudinal and cross-sectional heterogeneity in their composition and density. Whereas the diet dictates taxa dominance, microbial communities are linked intimately to host physiology through digestive and absorptive functions that generate longitudinal heterogeneity in nutrient availability. Additionally, the host differentially controls the access to electron acceptors along the longitudinal axis of the intestine to drive the development of microbial communities that are dominated by facultatively anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine or obligately anaerobic bacteria in the large intestine. By secreting mucus and antimicrobials, the host further constructs microhabitats that generate cross-sectional heterogeneity in the colonic microbiota composition. Here we will review how understanding the host factors involved in generating longitudinal and cross-sectional microbiota heterogeneity helps define physiological states that are characteristic of or appropriate to a homeostatic microbiome.

We aimed to determine if the newborn gut microbiota is an underlying determinant of early life growth trajectories. 132 Hispanic infants were recruited at 1-month postpartum. The infant gut microbiome was characterized using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Rapid infant growth was defined as a weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) change greater than 0.67 between birth and 12-months of age. Measures of infant growth included change in WAZ, weight-for-length z-score (WLZ), and body mass index (BMI) z-scores from birth to 12-months and infant anthropometrics at 12-months (weight, skinfold thickness). Of the 132 infants, 40% had rapid growth in the first year of life. Multiple metrics of alpha-diversity predicted rapid infant growth, including a higher Shannon diversity (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.07-3.29; p = .03), Faith's phylogenic diversity (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05-1.94; p = .03), and richness (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08; p = .02). Many of these alpha-diversity metrics were also positively associated with increases in WAZ, WLZ, and BMI z-scores from birth to 12-months (pall&lt;0.05). Importantly, we identified subsets of microbial consortia whose abundance were correlated with these same measures of infant growth. We also found that rapid growers were enriched in multiple taxa belonging to genera such as Acinetobacter, Collinsella, Enterococcus, Neisseria, and Parabacteroides. Moreover, measures of the newborn gut microbiota explained up to an additional 5% of the variance in rapid growth beyond known clinical predictors (R2 = 0.37 vs. 0.32, p &lt; .01). These findings indicate that a more mature gut microbiota, characterized by increased alpha-diversity, at as early as 1-month of age, may influence infant growth trajectories in the first year of life.

## Characterization of the Human Oropharyngeal Microbiomes in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Recovery Patients.

Respiratory tract microbiome is closely related to respiratory tract infections, while characterization of oropharyngeal microbiome in recovered coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is not studied. Herein, oropharyngeal swabs are collected from confirmed cases (CCs) with COVID-19 (73 subjects), suspected cases (SCs) (36), confirmed cases who recovered (21), suspected cases who recovered (36), and healthy controls (Hs) (140) and then completed MiSeq sequencing. Oropharyngeal microbial α-diversity is markedly reduced in CCs versus Hs. Opportunistic pathogens are increased, while butyrate-producing genera are decreased in CCs versus Hs. The classifier based on eight optimal microbial markers is constructed through a random forest model and reached great diagnostic efficacy in both discovery and validation cohorts. Notably, the classifier successfully diagnosed SCs with positive IgG antibody as CCs and is demonstrated from the perspective of the microbiome. Importantly, several genera with significant differences gradually increase and decrease along with recovery from COVID-19. Forty-four oropharyngeal operational taxonomy units (OTUs) are closely correlated with 11 clinical indicators of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Hs based on Spearman correlation analysis. Together, this research is the first to characterize oropharyngeal microbiota in recovered COVID-19 cases and suspected cases, to successfully construct and validate the diagnostic model for COVID-19 and to depict the correlations between microbial OTUs and clinical indicators.

## Metagenome-wide association study revealed disease-specific landscape of the gut microbiome of systemic lupus erythematosus in Japanese.

Alteration of the gut microbiome has been linked to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, a comprehensive view of the gut microbiome in SLE and its interaction with the host remains to be revealed. This study aimed to reveal SLE-associated changes in the gut microbiome and its interaction with the host by a comprehensive metagenome-wide association study (MWAS) followed by integrative analysis.

## Gut microbes participate in food preference alterations during obesity.
 27.08.2021, _A de Wouters d'Oplinter, M Rastelli, M Van Hul, NM Delzenne, PD Cani, A Everard_


Hypothalamic regulations of food intake are altered during obesity. The dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic system, responsible for the hedonic response to food intake, is also affected. Gut microbes are other key players involved in obesity. Therefore, we investigated whether the gut microbiota plays a causal role in hedonic food intake alterations contributing to obesity. We transferred fecal material from lean or diet-induced obese mice into recipient mice and evaluated the hedonic food intake using a food preference test comparing the intake of control and palatable diets (HFHS, High-Fat High-Sucrose) in donor and recipient mice. Obese mice ate 58% less HFHS during the food preference test (p &lt; 0.0001) than the lean donors, suggesting a dysregulation of the hedonic food intake during obesity. Strikingly, the reduction of the pleasure induced by eating during obesity was transferable through gut microbiota transplantation since obese gut microbiota recipient mice exhibited similar reduction in HFHS intake during the food preference test (40% reduction as compared to lean gut microbiota recipient mice, p &lt; 0.01). This effect was associated with a consistent trend in modifications of dopaminergic markers expression in the striatum. We also pinpointed a highly positive correlation between HFHS intake and Parabacteroides (p &lt; 0.0001), which could represent a potential actor involved in hedonic feeding probably through the gut-to-brain axis. We further demonstrated the key roles played by gut microbes in this paradigm since depletion of gut microbiota using broad-spectrum antibiotics also altered HFHS intake during food preference test in lean mice. In conclusion, we discovered that gut microbes regulate hedonic aspects of food intake. Our data demonstrate that gut microbiota modifications associated with obesity participate in dysregulations of the reward and hedonic components of the food intake. These data provide evidence that gut microbes could be an interesting therapeutic target to tackle hedonic disorders related to obesity.

## Altered gut microbiome compositions are associated with the severity of asthma.
 24.08.2021, _Z Wang, Z Lai, X Zhang, P Huang, J Xie, Q Jiang, Q Zhang, KF Chung_


Despite substantial evidence on the contribution of the diversity of the gut microbiome to the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic diseases, little is known about their relationship with asthma severity and/or clinical phenotypes. We analyzed the difference in composition of the gut microbiome between subjects with asthma and healthy subjects and explored its role in the development of asthma.
