Repeated rotation of empiric antibiotic treatment strategies is hypothesized to reduce antibiotic resistance. Clinical rotation studies failed to change unit-wide prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) carriage, including an international cluster-randomized crossover study. Unit-wide effects may differ from individual effects due to "ecological fallacy". This post-hoc analysis of a cluster-randomized crossover study assesses differences between cycling and mixing rotation strategies in acquisition of carriage with Gram-negative ARB in individual patients.
