## Predicting the Outbreak Risks and Inflection Points of COVID-19 Pandemic with Classic Ecological Theories.
 13.10.2020, _ZS Ma_


Predicting the outbreak risks and/or the inflection (turning or tipping) points of COVID-19 can be rather challenging. Here, it is addressed by modeling and simulation approaches guided by classic ecological theories and by treating the COVID-19 pandemic as a metapopulation dynamics problem. Three classic ecological theories are harnessed, including TPL (Taylor's power-law) and Ma's population aggregation critical density (PACD) for spatiotemporal aggregation/stability scaling, approximating virus metapopulation dynamics with Hubbell's neutral theory, and Ma's diversity-time relationship adapted for the infection-time relationship. Fisher-Information for detecting critical transitions and tipping points are also attempted. It is discovered that: (i) TPL aggregation/stability scaling parameter (b &gt; 2), being significantly higher than the b-values of most macrobial and microbial species including SARS, may interpret the chaotic pandemic of COVID-19. (ii) The infection aggregation critical threshold (M0) adapted from PACD varies with time (outbreak-stage), space (region) and public-health interventions. Exceeding M0, local contagions may become aggregated and connected regionally, leading to epidemic/pandemic. (iii) The ratio of fundamental dispersal to contagion numbers can gauge the relative importance between local contagions vs. regional migrations in spreading infections. (iv) The inflection (turning) points, pair of maximal infection number and corresponding time, are successfully predicted in more than 80% of Chinese provinces and 68 countries worldwide, with a precision &gt;80% generally.

## The Central Role of Interbacterial Antagonism in Bacterial Life.
 06.10.2020, _SB Peterson, SK Bertolli, JD Mougous_


The study of bacteria interacting with their environment has historically centered on strategies for obtaining nutrients and resisting abiotic stresses. We argue this focus has deemphasized a third facet of bacterial life that is equally central to their existence: namely, the threat to survival posed by antagonizing bacteria. The diversity and ubiquity of interbacterial antagonism pathways is becoming increasingly apparent, and the insidious manner by which interbacterial toxins disarm their targets emphasizes the highly evolved nature of these processes. Studies examining the role of antagonism in natural communities reveal it can serve many functions, from facilitating colonization of na√Øve habitats to maintaining bacterial community stability. The pervasiveness of antagonistic pathways is necessarily matched by an equally extensive array of defense strategies. These overlap with well characterized, central stress response pathways, highlighting the contribution of bacterial interactions to shaping cell physiology. In this review, we build the case for the ubiquity and importance of interbacterial antagonism.
