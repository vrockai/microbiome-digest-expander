The fast advancement and deployment of sequencing technologies after the Human Genome Project have greatly increased our knowledge of the eukaryotic genome sequences. However, due to technological concerns, high-quality genomic data has been confined to a few key organisms. Moreover, our understanding of which portions of genomes make up genes and which transcript isoforms synthesize these genes is scarce. Therefore, the current study has been designed to explore the reliability of the tiger lily (Lilium lancifolium Thunb) transcriptome. The PacBio-SMRT was used for attaining the complete transcriptomic profile. We obtained a total of 815,624 CCS (Circular Consensus Sequence) reads with an average length of 1295 bp. The tiger lily transcriptome has been sequenced for the first time using third-generation long-read technology. Furthermore, unigenes (38,707), lncRNAs (6852), and TF members (768) were determined based on the transcriptome data, followed by evaluating SSRs (3319). It has also been revealed that 105 out of 128 primer pairs effectively amplified PCR products. Around 15,608 transcripts were allocated to 25 distinct KOG Clusters, and 10,706 unigenes were grouped into 52 functional categories in the annotated transcripts. Until now, no tiger lily lncRNAs have been discovered. Results of this study may serve as an extensive set of reference transcripts and help us learn more about the transcriptomes of tiger lilies and pave the path for further research.
