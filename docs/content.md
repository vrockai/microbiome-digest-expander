## Characterization of a pericentric inversion in plateau fence lizards (Sceloporus tristichus): evidence from chromosome-scale genomes.
 12.03.2021, _AM Bedoya, AD Leaché_


Spiny lizards in the genus Sceloporus are a model system among squamate reptiles for studies of chromosomal evolution. While most pleurodont iguanians retain an ancestral karyotype formula of 2n = 36 chromosomes, Sceloporus exhibits substantial karyotype variation ranging from 2n = 22 to 46 chromosomes. We present two annotated chromosome-scale genome assemblies for the Plateau Fence Lizard (Sceloporus tristichus) to facilitate research on the role of pericentric inversion polymorphisms on adaptation and speciation. Based on previous karyotype work using conventional staining, the S. tristichus genome is characterized as 2n = 22 with six pairs of macrochromosomes and five pairs of microchromosomes and a pericentric inversion polymorphism on chromosome 7 that is geographically variable. We provide annotated, chromosome-scale genomes for two lizards located at opposite ends of a dynamic hybrid zone that are each fixed for different inversion polymorphisms. The assembled genomes are 1.84-1.87 Gb (1.72 Gb for scaffolds mapping to chromosomes) with a scaffold N50 of 267.5 Mb. Functional annotation of the genomes resulted in ∼15K predicted gene models. Our assemblies confirmed the presence of a 4.62-Mb pericentric inversion on chromosome 7, which contains 62 annotated coding genes with known functions. In addition, we collected population genomics data using double digest RAD-sequencing for 44 S. tristichus to estimate population structure and phylogeny across the Colorado Plateau. These new genomic resources provide opportunities to perform genomic scans and investigate the formation and spread of pericentric inversions in a naturally occurring hybrid zone.
