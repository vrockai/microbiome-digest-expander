_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

Establishing the infant's gut microbiota has long-term implications on health and immunity. Breastfeeding is recognized as the best practice of infant nutrition in comparison with formula feeding. We evaluated the effects of the primary feeding practices by analyzing the infant growth and the potential association with gut diseases. A cross-sectional and observational study was designed. This study included 55 mothers with infants, who were divided according to their feeding practices in breastfeeding (BF), formula feeding (FF), and combined breast and formula feeding (CF). Anthropometric measurements of the participants were recorded. Additionally, non-invasive fecal samples from the infants were collected to analyze the microbiota by sequencing, immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration (ELISA), and volatile organic compounds (gas chromatography with an electronic nose). Results showed that the microbiota diversity in the BF group was the highest compared to the other two groups. The IgA levels in the BF group were twice as high as those in the FF group. Moreover, the child´s growth in the BF group showed the best infant development when the data were compared at birth to the recollection time, as noted by the correlation with a decreased concentration of toxic volatile organic compounds. Interestingly, the CF group showed a significant difference in health status when the data were compared with the FF group. We conclude that early health practices influence children's growth, which is relevant to further research about how those infants' health evolved.

## A unified compendium of prokaryotic and viral genomes from over 300 anaerobic digestion microbiomes.

The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.

## Bacteroides and related species: The keystone taxa of the human gut microbiota.
 12.01.2024, _JH Shin, G Tillotson, TN MacKenzie, C Warren, HM Wexler, E Goldstein_


Microbial communities play a significant role in maintaining ecosystems in a healthy homeostasis. Presently, in the human gastrointestinal tract, there are certain taxonomic groups of importance, though there is no single species that plays a keystone role. Bacteroides spp. are known to be major players in the maintenance of eubiosis in the human gastrointestinal tract. Here we review the critical role that Bacteroides play in the human gut, their potential pathogenic role outside of the gut, and their various methods of adapting to the environment, with a focus on data for B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron. Bacteroides are anaerobic non-sporing gram-negative organisms that are also resistant to bile acids, generally thriving in the gut and having a beneficial relationship with the host. While they are generally commensal organisms, some Bacteroides spp. can be opportunistic pathogens in scenarios of GI disease, trauma, cancer, or GI surgery, and cause infection, most commonly intra-abdominal infection. B. fragilis can develop antimicrobial resistance through multiple mechanisms in large part due to its plasticity and fluid genome. Bacteroidota (formerly, Bacteroidetes) have a very broad metabolic potential in the GI microbiota and can rapidly adapt their carbohydrate metabolism to the available nutrients. Gastrointestinal Bacteroidota species produce short-chain fatty acids such as succinate, acetate, butyrate, and occasionally propionate, as the major end-products, which have wide-ranging and many beneficial influences on the host. Bacteroidota, via bile acid metabolism, also play a role in in colonization-resistance of other organisms, including Clostridioides difficile, and maintenance of gut integrity.

## Impact of Helicobacter pylori colonization density and depth on gastritis severity.
 12.01.2024, _J Peng, J Xie, D Liu, K Yang, S Wu, D Liu, D Huang, Y Xie_


Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the most common etiology of chronic gastric. H. pylori gastritis would gradually evolve into gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and malignant lesions. Herein, this study aimed to investigate the potential impact of H. pylori colonization density and depth on the severity of histological parameters of gastritis.

Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) often present sleep disorders and circadian hormonal dysregulation. The role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the regulation of feeding behavior has emerged during the last decades but its relationships with the circadian rhythm remains poorly documented. Thus, we aimed to characterize the circadian clock genes expression in peripheral and central tissues in the activity-based anorexia mouse model (ABA), as well as the dynamics of the gut-microbiota composition.

Nanodecoy systems based on analogues of viral cellular receptors assembled onto fluid lipid-based membranes of nano/extravescicles are potential new tools to complement classic therapeutic or preventive antiviral approaches. The need for lipid-based membranes for transmembrane receptor anchorage may pose technical challenges along industrial translation, calling for alternative geometries for receptor multimerization. Here we developed a semisynthetic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanodecoy by multimerizing the biotin labelled virus cell receptor -ACE2- ectodomain onto a poly-avidin nanoparticle (NP) based on the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly-ANANAS. The ability of the assembly to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and the affinity of the ACE2:viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction were measured at different ACE2:NP ratios. At ACE2:NP = 30, 90 % SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition at ACE2 nanomolar concentration was registered on both Wuhan and Omicron variants, with ten-fold higher potency than the monomeric protein. Lower and higher ACE2 densities were less efficient suggesting that functional recognition between multi-ligand NPs and multi-receptor virus surfaces requires optimal geometrical relationships. In vivo studies in mice showed that the biodistribution and safety profiles of the nanodecoy are potentially suitable for preventing viral infection upon nasal instillation. Viral receptor multimerization using ANANAS is a convenient process which, in principle, could be rapidly adapted to counteract also other viral infections.
