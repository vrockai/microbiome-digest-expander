## Combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing of respiratory samples: Does the DNA extraction method matter?
 28.04.2020, _C Angebault, M Payen, PL Woerther, C Rodriguez, F Botterel_


High-throughput sequencing techniques are used to analyse the diversity of the respiratory microbiota in health and disease. Although extensive data are available regarding bacterial respiratory microbiota, its fungal component remains poorly studied. This is partly due to the technical issues associated with fungal metagenomics analyses. In this study, we compared two DNA extraction protocols and two fungal amplification targets for combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing analyses of the respiratory microbiota.

## High L-carnitine ingestion impairs liver function by disordering gut bacteria composition in mice.
 28.04.2020, _Q Wu, X Zhang, Y Zhao, X Yang_


This article was to study the effects of high L-carnitine consumption on intestinal microbiota, liver function and metabolite distribution in mice. 16S rRNA results showed that high L-carnitine supplementation could induce the accumulation of Anaerobiospirillum, Coriobacteriaceae, Akkermansia_muciniphila and Helicobacter. High intake of L-carnitine also induced liver injury, which was proved by the increases in the serum AST and ALT activities, production of inflammatory liver cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and TNF-β), lipid metabolism (TC, TG, HDL and LDL) disorder, and the decline in antioxidant ability (SOD, GSH-Px, MDA and RAHFR). The correlation analysis results showed that Anaerobiospirillum, Akkermansia_ muciniphila and Helicobacter were strongly positively correlated with AST, IL-1, TNF-α, TNF-β and MDA levels (r&gt;0.5, p&lt;0.01 or p&lt;0.05). All in all, high L-carnitine ingestion could induce liver function decline by disordering gut bacteria composition, resulting in the increase of TMAO metabolism.

## Harnessing rhizosphere microbiomes for drought-resilient crop production.
 28.04.2020, _FT de Vries, RI Griffiths, CG Knight, O Nicolitch, A Williams_


Root-associated microbes can improve plant growth, and they offer the potential to increase crop resilience to future drought. Although our understanding of the complex feedbacks between plant and microbial responses to drought is advancing, most of our knowledge comes from non-crop plants in controlled experiments. We propose that future research efforts should attempt to quantify relationships between plant and microbial traits, explicitly focus on food crops, and include longer-term experiments under field conditions. Overall, we highlight the need for improved mechanistic understanding of the complex feedbacks between plants and microbes during, and particularly after, drought. This requires integrating ecology with plant, microbiome, and molecular approaches and is central to making crop production more resilient to our future climate.

## Plant nutrient-acquisition strategies drive topsoil microbiome structure and function.
 12.04.2020, _M Bahram, T Netherway, F Hildebrand, K Pritsch, R Drenkhan, K Loit, S Anslan, P Bork, L Tedersoo_


Plant nutrient acquisition strategies drive soil processes and vegetation performance, but their effect on the soil microbiome remains poorly understood. This knowledge is important to predict the shifts in microbial diversity and functions to increasing changes in vegetation traits under global change. Here we documented the topsoil microbiomes of 145 boreal and temperate terrestrial sites in the Baltic region that broadly differed in vegetation type and nutritional traits, such as mycorrhizal types and symbiotic nitrogen-fixation. We found that sites dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) vegetation harbor relatively more AM fungi, bacteria, fungal saprotrophs, and pathogens in the topsoil compared with sites dominated by ectomycorrhizal (EM) plants. These differences in microbiome composition reflect the rapid nutrient cycling and negative plant-soil feedback in AM soils. Lower fungal diversity and bacteria-to-fungi ratios in EM-dominated habitats are driven by monodominance of woody vegetation as well as soil acidification by EM fungi, which are associated with greater diversity and relative abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes. Our study suggests that shifts in vegetation related to global change and land use may strongly alter the topsoil microbiome structure and function.

## Metal-induced bacterial interactions promote diversity in river-sediment microbiomes.
 28.04.2020, _V Cyriaque, A Géron, G Billon, J Nesme, J Werner, DC Gillan, SJ Sørensen, R Wattiez_


Anthropogenic metal contamination results in long-term environmental selective pressure with unclear impacts on bacterial communities which comprise key players in ecosystem functioning. Since metal contamination poses serious toxicity and bioaccumulation issues, assessing their impact on environmental microbiomes is important to respond to current environmental and health issues. Despite elevated metal concentrations, the river sedimentary microbiome near the MetalEurop foundry (France) shows unexpected higher diversity compared to upstream control site. In this work, a follow-up of the microbial community assembly during a metal contamination event was performed in microcosms with periodic renewal of the supernatant river water. Sediments of the control site were gradually exposed to a mixture of metals (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn), in order to reach similar concentrations to MetalEurop sediments. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed. Metal resistance genes czcA and pbrA, as well as IncP plasmid content were assessed by quantitative PCR. The outcomes of this study support previous in-situ observations showing that metals act as community assembly managers, increasing diversity. This work revealed progressive adaptation of the sediment microbiome through the selection of different metal-resistance mechanisms and cross-species interactions involving public good providing bacteria co-occurring with the rest of the community.
