## Effects of ultra-processed foods on the microbiota-gut-brain axis: The bread-and-butter issue.
 22.04.2023, _Z Song, R Song, Y Liu, Z Wu, X Zhang_


The topic of gut microbiota and the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis has become the forefront of research and reports in the past few years. The gut microbiota is a dynamic interface between the environment, food, and the host, reflecting the health status as well as maintaining normal physiological metabolism. Modern ultra-processed foods (UPF) contain large quantities of saturated and trans fat, added sugar, salt, and food additives that seriously affect the gut and physical health. In addition, these unhealthy components directly cause changes in gut microbiota functions and microbial metabolism, subsequently having the potential to impact the neural network. This paper reviews an overview of the link between UPF ingredients and the MGB axis. Considerable studies have examined that high intake of trans fat, added sugar and salt have deleterious effects on gut and brain functions, but relatively less focus has been placed on the impact of food additives on the MGB axis. Data from several studies suggest that food additives might be linked to metabolic diseases and inflammation. They may also alter the gut microbiota composition and microbial metabolites, which potentially affect cognition and behavior. Therefore, we emphasize that food additives including emulsifiers, artificial sweeteners, colorants, and preservatives interact with the gut microbiota and their possible effects on altering the brain and behavior based on the latest research. Future studies should further investigate whether gut dysbiosis mediates the effect of UPF on brain diseases and behavior. This thesis here sheds new light on future research pointing to the potentially detrimental effects of processed food consumption on brain health.

The human gut microbiota continues to demonstrate its importance in human health and disease, largely owing to the countless number of studies investigating the fecal microbiota. Underrepresented in these studies, however, is the role played by microbial communities found in the small intestine, which, given the essential function of the small intestine in nutrient absorption, host metabolism, and immunity, is likely highly relevant. This review provides an overview of the methods used to study the microbiota composition and dynamics along different sections of the small intestine. Furthermore, it explores the role of the microbiota in facilitating the small intestine in its physiological functions and discusses how disruption of the microbial equilibrium can influence disease development. The evidence suggests that the small intestinal microbiota is an important regulator of human health and its characterization has the potential to greatly advance gut microbiome research and the development of novel disease diagnostics and therapeutics.

The gut microbiome plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis and therapy. Some studies have reported that specific bacteria in tumor tissues may contribute to the prognosis and treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, there is limited evidence that the gut microbiome is associated with ESCC. This study assessed the utility of the gut microbiome as a predictive marker of the therapeutic effect in patients with ESCC undergoing chemo-radiotherapy (CRT).

## Multi-omics signatures in new-onset diabetes predict metabolic response to dietary inulin: findings from an observational study followed by an interventional trial.
 21.04.2023, _N Ďásková, I Modos, M Krbcová, M Kuzma, H Pelantová, J Hradecký, M Heczková, M Bratová, P Videňská, P Šplíchalová, M Králová, M Heniková, J Potočková, A Ouřadová, R Landberg, T Kühn, M Cahová, J Gojda_


The metabolic performance of the gut microbiota contributes to the onset of type 2 diabetes. However, targeted dietary interventions are limited by the highly variable inter-individual response. We hypothesized (1) that the composition of the complex gut microbiome and metabolome (MIME) differ across metabolic spectra (lean-obese-diabetes); (2) that specific MIME patterns could explain the differential responses to dietary inulin; and (3) that the response can be predicted based on baseline MIME signature and clinical characteristics.

## Comparison of Conjunctival Sac Microbiome between Low and High Myopic Eyes.
 21.04.2023, _K Xiao, Z Chen, Q Long_


Microbial communities played a vital role in maintaining homeostasis of ocular surface. However, no studies explored the myopia-associated conjunctiva microbiota changes until now. In this study, conjunctival sac swab specimens were collected from 12 eyes of low myopia (LM), and 14 eyes of high myopia (HM) patients. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and then sequenced. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate differences in the taxonomy and diversity between two groups. Compared to LM, higher Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores were observed in HM group. The Shannon index of the HM was lower than that of the LM group (P = 0.017). Principle coordinate analysis and Partial Least Squares Discrimination Analysis showed distinct microbiome composition between two groups. At the phylum level, there were higher relative abundances of Proteobacteria (68.27% vs 38.51%) and lower abundances of Actinobacteria (3.71% vs 9.19%) in HM, compared to LM group (P = 0.031, 0.010, respectively). At the genus level, the abundances of Acinetobacter in HM (18.16%) were significantly higher than the LM (6.52%) group (P = 0.011). Actinobacteria levels were negatively correlated with the myopic spherical equivalent and OSDI scores. Moreover, positive correlations were found between Proteobacteria levels and OSDI scores, Acinetobacter levels were positively correlated with myopic spherical equivalent and OSDI scores. In conclusion, HM Patients have bacterial microbiota imbalance in the conjunctival sac, compared with LM patients. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acinetobacter may play roles in the HM associated ocular surface irritation.

## Biologically-Coupled Bisphosphonate Chaperones Effectively Deliver Molecules to the Site of Soft Tissue-Bone Healing.
 23.04.2023, _TJ Kremen, BY Shi, SY Wu, O Sundberg, V Sriram, W Kim, D Sheyn, KM Lyons, W Wang, CE McKenna, I Nishimura_


Tendon injuries are common and often treated surgically, however, current tendon repair healing results in poorly organized fibrotic tissue. While certain growth factors have been reported to improve both the strength and organization of the repaired enthesis, their clinical applicability is severely limited due to a lack of appropriate delivery strategies. In this study, we evaluated a recently developed fluorescent probe, Osteoadsorptive Fluorogenic Sentinel-3 (OFS-3) that is composed of a bone-targeting bisphosphonate moiety linked to fluorochrome and quencher molecules joined via a cathepsin K-sensitive peptide sequence. Using a murine Achilles tendon-to-bone repair model, bisphosphonate-based and/or Ctsk-coupled imaging probes were applied either locally or systemically. Fluorescence imaging was used to quantify the resultant signal in vivo. After tendon-bone repair, animals that received either local or systemic administration of imaging probes demonstrated significantly higher fluorescence signal at the repair site compared to the sham surgery group at all time points (p&lt;0.001), with signal peaking at 7 to 10 days after surgery. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using a novel bisphosphonate-based targeting and Ctsk-activated delivery of molecules to the site of tendon-to-bone repair and creates a foundation for further development of this platform as an effective strategy to deliver bioactive molecules to sites of musculoskeletal injury.

## The Effect of Different Zinc Sources on Biochemical Parameters, Intestinal Morphology, Carcass Characteristics and Performance in Finishing Lambs.
 23.04.2023, _SHM Esfiokhi, MA Norouzian, A Najafi_


To investigate the effect of different sources of zinc supplements on blood serum parameters, nutrient digestibility, growth performance, carcass characteristics, and intestinal morphology, 18 male Zandi lambs (with initial body weight of 31 ± 1.2 kg and 120 ± 8 days old) were divided into three groups, six animals each in a completely random design. Experimental treatments include (1) control treatment of basal diet without zinc supplementation, (2) basal diet with 40 mg/kg of zinc supplementation from zinc sulfate source, and (3) basal diet with 40 mg/kg of zinc supplementation with origin it was organic (Zn-peptide). All lambs were kept in individual pens with cemented floor and provision of individual feeding and watering. Mean daily weight gain increased with zinc supplementation (P &lt; 0.05), but feed intake and feed conversion ratio were not affected by zinc supplementation in the diet. Zinc supplementation increased the apparent digestibility of the dry matter (P &lt; 0.05), but the digestibility of dietary fat, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were not affected by zinc supplementation. In this experiment, the addition of organic and inorganic supplements to the diet of fattening lambs had no significant effect on serum triglyceride, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and glucose concentrations, and carcass traits. The concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzyme in the zinc sulfate group was significantly higher than the control and organic zinc groups (P &lt; 0.05). Concentrations of blood urea nitrogen were lower in zinc fed lambs, compared to control (P ≤ 0.05). The villi width in the duodenum was higher in the zinc supplementation treatments (P &lt; 0.05). Also, in the ileum section, the height of the villi in the treatment of zinc sulfate supplement was higher, compared to the complement and control (P &lt; 0.05). The results of this study showed that Zn supplementation, regardless of its source, improved growth performance in fattening lambs. However, no effect was observed on feed intake and efficiency, carcass traits, and blood parameters.

## Use of probiotic lactobacilli in the treatment of vaginal infections: In vitro and in vivo investigations.
 21.04.2023, _P Liu, Y Lu, R Li, X Chen_


_Infant, Newborn, Female, Humans, Lactobacillus, Premature Birth, Vagina, Vulvovaginitis, Probiotics_
The vaginal microbiome is a distinct component of the human microbiome that is colonized by a wide variety of microorganisms. Lactobacilli are the most frequently identified microorganisms in the healthy human vagina. These Gram-positive bacilli can acidify the vaginal microenvironment, inhibit the proliferation of other pathogenic microorganisms, and promote the maintenance of a eubiotic vaginal microbiome. However, a vaginal flora with a reduced proportion or abundance of lactobacilli is associated with various vaginal infections that have been linked to serious health consequences such as infertility, preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, premature rupture of membranes, and miscarriage. Due to their "Generally Recognized as Safe" classification and critical role in vaginal health, probiotic lactobacilli have been widely used as an alternative or adjunct to traditional antibiotic therapy for the treatment of vaginal infections and restoration of the vaginal microbiome. This review focuses on the significant role of probiotic lactobacilli in the vaginal microenvironment and discusses the use of probiotic lactobacilli in the treatment of female vaginal infections in vitro and in vivo.

## The hindgut microbiome contributes to host oxidative stress in postpartum dairy cows by affecting glutathione synthesis process.
 22.04.2023, _F Gu, S Zhu, J Hou, Y Tang, JX Liu, Q Xu, HZ Sun_


Dairy cows are susceptible to postpartum systemic oxidative stress (OS), which leads to significant production loss and metabolic disorders. The gut microbiota has been linked to host health and stress levels. However, to what extent the gut microbiota is associated with postpartum OS remains unknown. In this study, the contribution of the fecal microbiota to postpartum systemic OS and its underlying mechanisms were investigated by integrating 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, and metabolomics in postpartum dairy cattle and by transplanting fecal microbiota from cattle to mice.
