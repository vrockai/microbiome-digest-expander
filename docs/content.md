## Trout-like multifunctional piezoelectric robotic fish and energy harvester.
 13.05.2021, _D Tan, YC Wang, E Kohtanen, A Erturk_


This work presents our experimental studies on a trout-inspired multifunctional robotic fish as an underwater swimmer and energy harvester. Fiber-based flexible piezoelectric composites with interdigitated electrodes, specifically Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) structures, strike a balance between the deformation and actuation force capabilities to generate hydrodynamic propulsion without requiring additional mechanisms for motion amplification. A pair of MFC laminates bracketing a passive fin functions like artificial muscle when driven out of phase to expand and contract on each side to create bending. The trout-like robotic fish design explored in this work was tested for both unconstrained swimming in a quiescent water tank and under imposed flow in a water tunnel to estimate the maximum swimming speed, which exceeded 0.25 m/s, i.e., 0.8 body length per second. Hydrodynamic thrust characterization was also performed in a quiescent water setting, and it was found that the fin can easily produce tens of mN thrust, similar to its biological counterpart for similar swimming speeds. Overall, the prototype presented here generates thrust levels higher than other smart material-based concepts (such as soft polymeric material-based actuators which provide large deformation but low force), while offering simple design, geometric scalability, and silent operation unlike motor-based robotic fish (which use bulky actuators and complex mechanisms). Additionally, energy harvesting experiments were performed to convert flow-induced vibrations at the wake of a cylindrical bluff body (for different diameters) in a water tunnel. The shed vortex frequency range for a set of bluff body diameters covered the first vibration mode of the tail, yielding an average electrical power of 120 μW at resonance for a flow speed around 0.3 m/s and a bluff body diameter of 28.6 mm. Such low-power electricity can find applications to power small sensors of the robotic fish in scenarios such as ecological monitoring, among others.

## Improving Medical and Nurse Practitioner Student Confidence and Clinical Skill in Advance Care Plan Development: A Multidisciplinary Mentorship Model.
 13.05.2021, _AC Coogan, MM Shifrin, MT Williams, J Alverio, VJ Periyakoil, MB Karlekar_


Advance care planning (ACP) is an integral aspect of patient-centered care, however medical (MD) and Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (AGACNP) students receive minimal education on how to facilitate ACP discussions and ultimately feel uncomfortable having these discussions with patients.1-4 The aim of this project was to increase MD and AGACNP students' perceived ability and confidence in leading ACP conversations through an ACP educational program called the Letter Project Pilot (LPP).

## Reconstruction of ancient microbial genomes from the human gut.
 13.05.2021, _MC Wibowo, Z Yang, M Borry, A Hübner, KD Huang, BT Tierney, S Zimmerman, F Barajas-Olmos, C Contreras-Cubas, H García-Ortiz, A Martínez-Hernández, JM Luber, P Kirstahler, T Blohm, FE Smiley, R Arnold, SA Ballal, SJ Pamp, J Russ, F Maixner, O Rota-Stabelli, N Segata, K Reinhard, L Orozco, C Warinner, M Snow, S LeBlanc, AD Kostic_


Loss of gut microbial diversity1-6 in industrial populations is associated with chronic diseases7, underscoring the importance of studying our ancestral gut microbiome. However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000-2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.

## Arsenic bioaccumulation in the soil fauna alters its gut microbiome and microbial arsenic biotransformation capacity.
 13.05.2021, _HT Wang, ZZ Liang, J Ding, XM Xue, G Li, SL Fu, D Zhu_


The biotransformation of arsenic mediated by microorganisms plays an important role in the arsenic biogeochemical cycle. However, the fate and biotransformation of arsenic in different soil fauna gut microbiota are largely unknown. Herein the effects of arsenic contamination on five types of soil fauna were compared by examining variations in arsenic bioaccumulation, gut microbiota, and arsenic biotransformation genes (ABGs). Significant difference was observed in the arsenic bioaccumulation across several fauna body tissues, and Metaphire californica had the highest arsenic bioaccumulation, with a value of 107 ± 1.41 mg kg-1. Arsenic exposure significantly altered overall patterns of ABGs; however, dominant genes involved in arsenic redox and other genes involved in arsenic methylation and demethylation were not significantly changed across animals. Except for M. californica, the abundance of ABGs in other animal guts firstly increased and then decreased with increasing arsenic concentrations. In addition, exposure of soil fauna to arsenic led to shifts in the unique gut-associated bacterial community, but the magnitude of these changes varied significantly across ecological groups of soil fauna. A good correlation between the gut bacterial communities and ABG profiles was observed, suggesting that gut microbiota plays important roles in the biotransformation of arsenic. Overall, these results provide a universal profiling of a microbial community capable of arsenic biotransformation in different fauna guts. Considering the global distribution of soil fauna in the terrestrial ecosystem, this finding broadens our understanding of the hidden role of soil fauna in the arsenic bioaccumulation and biogeochemical cycle.

## Mechanical biofilm disruption causes microbial and immunological shifts in periodontitis patients.
 11.05.2021, _W Johnston, BT Rosier, A Artacho, M Paterson, K Piela, C Delaney, JL Brown, G Ramage, A Mira, S Culshaw_


Periodontitis is characterized by subgingival biofilm dysbiosis, inflammation and tissue destruction. Current treatment involves mechanical biofilm disruption known as non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). This study sought to characterise the impact of treatment on microbial diversity and overall community, and the parallel impact on host inflammation in the oral cavity. Fourty-two periodontitis patients were included in this study, with periodontal clinical parameters, subgingival plaque and saliva samples collected at baseline and 90 days after treatment. Salivary cytokines were quantified, and subgingival plaque was analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing. After treatment, there were marked health-associated alterations in microbial composition and diversity, including differential abundance of 42 genera and 61 species. These changes were accompanied by substantial clinical improvement (pockets ≥ 5 mm, 27.50% to 9.00%, p &lt; 0.001) and a decrease in salivary IL-1β (p &lt; 0.001)-a putative marker of periodontal inflammation. Despite significant reductions in disease associated anaerobes, several genera (Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Tanenerella, Treponema) remained present and formed a distinct subnetwork associated with residual disease. Collectively, this study shows that current periodontal treatment results in partial restoration of a healthy microbial ecosystem, but features of biofilm dysbiosis and host inflammation remain in some patients, which were surprisingly independent of clinical response.

## The Complex Link between the Female Genital Microbiota, Genital Infections, and Inflammation.
 04.05.2021, _S Dabee, JS Passmore, R Heffron, HB Jaspan_


The female genital tract microbiota is part of a complex ecosystem influenced by several physiological, genetic, and behavioral factors. It is uniquely linked to a woman's mucosal immunity and plays a critical role in the regulation of genital inflammation. A vaginal microbiota characterized by a high abundance of lactobacilli and low overall bacterial diversity is associated with lower inflammation. On the other hand, a more diverse microbiota is linked to high mucosal inflammation levels, a compromised genital epithelial barrier, and an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections and other conditions. Several bacterial taxa such as Gardnerella spp., Prevotella spp., Sneathia spp., and Atopobium spp. are well known to have adverse effects; however, the definitive cause of this microbial dysbiosis is yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of this review is to discuss the multiple ways in which the microbiota influences the overall genital inflammatory milieu and to explore the causes and consequences of this inflammatory response. While there is abundant evidence linking a diverse genital microbiota to elevated inflammation, understanding the risk factors and mechanisms through which it affects genital health is essential. A robust appreciation of these factors is important for identifying effective prevention and treatment strategies.

## Urinary prostaglandin E2 as a biomarker for recurrent UTI in postmenopausal women.
 11.05.2021, _T Ebrahimzadeh, A Kuprasertkul, ML Neugent, KC Lutz, JL Fuentes, J Gadhvi, F Khan, C Zhang, BM Sharon, K Orth, Q Li, PE Zimmern, NJ De Nisco_


Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common adult bacterial infections and exhibits high recurrence rates, especially in postmenopausal women. Studies in mouse models suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-mediated inflammation sensitizes the bladder to recurrent UTI (rUTI). However, COX-2-mediated inflammation has not been robustly studied in human rUTI. We used human cohorts to assess urothelial COX-2 production and evaluate its product, PGE2, as a biomarker for rUTI in postmenopausal women. We found that the percentage of COX-2-positive cells was elevated in inflamed versus uninflamed bladder regions. We analyzed the performance of urinary PGE2 as a biomarker for rUTI in a controlled cohort of 92 postmenopausal women and PGE2 consistently outperformed all other tested clinical variables as a predictor of rUTI status. Furthermore, time-to-relapse analysis indicated that the risk of rUTI relapse was 3.6 times higher in women with above median urinary PGE2 levels than with below median levels. Taken together, these data suggest that urinary PGE2 may be a clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for rUTI in postmenopausal women.

Long-read sequencing in metagenomics facilitates the assembly of complete genomes out of complex microbial communities. These genomes include essential biologic information such as the ribosomal genes or the mobile genetic elements, which are usually missed with short-reads. We applied long-read metagenomics with Nanopore sequencing to retrieve high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (HQ MAGs) from a dog fecal sample.

## Perinatal exposure to tetracycline contributes to lasting developmental effects on offspring.
 12.05.2021, _EM Hill, CD Howard, TL Bale, E Jašarević_


For more than 30 years, the tetracycline on/off system of inducible gene expression has been leveraged to study disease mechanisms across many research areas, especially that of metabolism and neuroscience. This system requires acute or chronic exposure to tetracycline derivatives, such as doxycycline, to manipulate gene expression in a temporal and tissue-specific manner, with exposure often being restricted to gestational and early developmental windows. Despite evidence showing that early life antibiotic exposure has adverse effects on gut microbiota, metabolism, physiology, immunity and behavior, little is known regarding the lasting impact of doxycycline treatment on relevant outcomes in experimental offspring.

## Ayurvedic management of female infertility due to tubal blockage.
 13.05.2021, _SP Otta, RG Reddy, S Sangvikar, R Tripathy_


Secondary Infertility is a major concern worldwide, accounting for about 40% of female infertility due to lifestyle factor. Secondary Infertility is having a close proximity to a disorder Vandhyatwa explained in Ayurvedic classics, due to a variety of causes. Several Ayurvedic interventions are advised such as Panchakarma (∼purification therapy) for vitiated Doshas in female reproductive organs, Snehapana (∼oral intake of medicated oil) followed by Virechana (∼purgation) to produce quality ovum. Other internal medications like Phalaghrita, Ashokarishta, Kanchanara guggulu etc. have a probable mode of action with enhancing the perceptibility of endometrium for implantation. Correlating fallopian tubes with the Artavavaha Srotas, its block is compared with the Sanga Srotodushti (obstructive pathology occurring in channels)of this Srotas. By virtue of the purification therapy and internal medication working synergistically might remove the Srotodustht.

## Improving metagenomic binning results with overlapped bins using assembly graphs.
 08.05.2021, _VG Mallawaarachchi, AS Wickramarachchi, Y Lin_


Metagenomic sequencing allows us to study the structure, diversity and ecology in microbial communities without the necessity of obtaining pure cultures. In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for binning contigs only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species).

## A method for achieving complete microbial genomes and improving bins from metagenomics data.
 07.05.2021, _LM Lui, TN Nielsen, AP Arkin_


Metagenomics facilitates the study of the genetic information from uncultured microbes and complex microbial communities. Assembling complete genomes from metagenomics data is difficult because most samples have high organismal complexity and strain diversity. Some studies have attempted to extract complete bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes and often focus on species with circular genomes so they can help confirm completeness with circularity. However, less than 100 circularized bacterial and archaeal genomes have been assembled and published from metagenomics data despite the thousands of datasets that are available. Circularized genomes are important for (1) building a reference collection as scaffolds for future assemblies, (2) providing complete gene content of a genome, (3) confirming little or no contamination of a genome, (4) studying the genomic context and synteny of genes, and (5) linking protein coding genes to ribosomal RNA genes to aid metabolic inference in 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. We developed a semi-automated method called Jorg to help circularize small bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes using iterative assembly, binning, and read mapping. In addition, this method exposes potential misassemblies from k-mer based assemblies. We chose species of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) to focus our initial efforts because they have small genomes and are only known to have one ribosomal RNA operon. In addition to 34 circular CPR genomes, we present one circular Margulisbacteria genome, one circular Chloroflexi genome, and two circular megaphage genomes from 19 public and published datasets. We demonstrate findings that would likely be difficult without circularizing genomes, including that ribosomal genes are likely not operonic in the majority of CPR, and that some CPR harbor diverged forms of RNase P RNA. Code and a tutorial for this method is available at https://github.com/lmlui/Jorg and is available on the DOE Systems Biology KnowledgeBase as a beta app.

## Taxonomic annotation of 16S rRNA sequences of pig intestinal samples using MG-RAST and QIIME2 generated different microbiota compositions.
 11.05.2021, _J Lima, T Manning, KM Rutherford, ET Baima, RJ Dewhurst, P Walsh, R Roehe_


Environmental microbiome studies rely on fast and accurate bioinformatics tools to characterize the taxonomic composition of samples based on the 16S rRNA gene. MetaGenome Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (MG-RAST) and Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2) are two of the most popular tools available to perform this task. Their underlying algorithms differ in many aspects, and therefore the comparison of the pipelines provides insights into their best use and interpretation of the outcomes. Both of these bioinformatics tools are based on several specialized algorithms pipelined together, but whereas MG-RAST is a user-friendly webserver that clusters rRNA sequences based on their similarity to create Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU), QIIME2 employs DADA2 in the construction of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) by applying an error model that considers the abundance of each sequence and its similarity to other sequences. Taxonomic compositions obtained from the analyses of amplicon sequences of DNA from swine intestinal gut and faecal microbiota samples using MG-RAST and QIIME2 were compared at domain-, phylum-, family- and genus-levels in terms of richness, relative abundance and diversity. We found significant differences between the microbiota profiles obtained from each pipeline. At domain level, bacteria were relatively more abundant using QIIME2 than MG-RAST; at phylum level, seven taxa were identified exclusively by QIIME2; at family level, samples processed in QIIME2 showed higher evenness and richness (assessed by Shannon and Simpson indices). The genus-level compositions obtained from each pipeline were used in partial least squares-discriminant analyses (PLS-DA) to discriminate between sample collection sites (caecum, colon and faeces). The results showed that different genera were found to be significant for the models, based on the Variable Importance in Projection, e.g. when using sequencing data processed by MG-RAST, the three most important genera were Acetitomaculum, Ruminococcus and Methanosphaera, whereas when data was processed using QIIME2, these were Candidatus Methanomethylophilus, Sphaerochaeta and Anaerorhabdus. Furthermore, the application of differential filtering procedures before the PLS-DA revealed higher accuracy when using non-restricted datasets obtained from MG-RAST, whereas datasets obtained from QIIME2 resulted in more accurate discrimination of sample collection sites after removing genera with low relative abundances (&lt;1%) from the datasets. Our results highlight the differences in taxonomic compositions of samples obtained from the two separate pipelines, while underlining the impact on downstream analyses, such as biomarkers identification.

## Role of ACE2 polymorphism in COVID-19: impact of age.
 13.05.2021, _S Mohaghegh, P Motie, SR Motamedian_


More than 2 million people have died as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a counter-regulatory enzyme that converts angiotensin-2 to Ang-(1-7) form in the renin-angiotensin system. Several studies have been analyzed the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19. Indeed, ACE2/Ang (1-7) system protects the lung against acute respiratory distress syndrome by its anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant function. However, SARS-Cov-2 can use ACE2 for host cell entry. Expression of ACE2 can be altered by several factors, including hypertension, diabetes and obesity, which also could increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Besides, since androgens increase the expression of ACE-2, males are at higher risks of COVID-19 infection. Although reported statistics showed a significantly different infection risks of COVID-19 between adults and children, the reason behind the different responses is still unclear. This review proposes the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of SARS-COV-2 induced pneumonia. The previous meta-analysis regarding the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of pneumonia showed that polymorphism only affects the adult's illness severity and not the children. Two recent meta-analyses examined the effect of ACE polymorphism on the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 and reported contradicting results. Our opinion paper suggests that the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of COVID-19 depends on the patients age, same as of the pneumonia.

Objective To explore the feasibility of the CT image reconstruction of laryngeal cartilage and hyoid bone in adult age estimation using data mining methods. Methods The neck thin slice CT scans of 413 individuals aged 18 to &lt;80 years were collected and divided into test set and train set, randomly. According to grading methods such as TURK et al., all samples were graded comprehensively. The process of thyroid cartilage ossification was divided into 6 stages, the process of cricoid cartilage ossification was divided into 5 stages, and the synosteosis between the greater horn of hyoid and hyoid body was divided into 3 stages. Multiple linear regression model, support vector regression model, and Bayesian ridge regression model were developed for adult age estimation by scikit-learn 0.17 machine learning kit （Python language）. Leave-one-out cross-validation and the test set were used to further evaluate performance of the models. Results All indicators were moderately or poorly associated with age. The model with the highest accuracy in male age estimation was the support vector regression model, with a mean absolute error of 8.67 years, much higher than the other two models. The model with the highest accuracy in female adult age estimation was the support vector regression model, with a mean absolute error of 12.69 years, but its accuracy differences with the other two models had no statistical significance. Conclusion Data mining technology can improve the accuracy of adult age estimation, but the accuracy of adult age estimation based on laryngeal cartilage and hyoid bone is still not satisfactory, so it should be combined with other indicators in practice.

## Migrating from partial least squares discriminant analysis to artificial neural networks: a comparison of functionally equivalent visualisation and feature contribution tools using jupyter notebooks.
 30.12.2020, _KM Mendez, DI Broadhurst, SN Reinke_


_Discriminant Analysis, Least-Squares Analysis, Metabolomics, Neural Networks, Computer, Software_
Metabolomics data is commonly modelled multivariately using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Its success is primarily due to ease of interpretation, through projection to latent structures, and transparent assessment of feature importance using regression coefficients and Variable Importance in Projection scores. In recent years several non-linear machine learning (ML) methods have grown in popularity but with limited uptake essentially due to convoluted optimisation and interpretation. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a non-linear projection-based ML method that share a structural equivalence with PLS, and as such should be amenable to equivalent optimisation and interpretation methods.

## DNA methylation and gene expression integration in cardiovascular disease.
 14.04.2021, _G Palou-Márquez, I Subirana, L Nonell, A Fernández-Sanlés, R Elosua_


The integration of different layers of omics information is an opportunity to tackle the complexity of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and to identify new predictive biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. Our aim was to integrate DNA methylation and gene expression data in an effort to identify biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease risk in a community-based population. We accessed data from the Framingham Offspring Study, a cohort study with data on DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip; Illumina) and gene expression (Human Exon 1.0 ST Array; Affymetrix). Using the MOFA2 R package, we integrated these data to identify biomarkers related to the risk of presenting a cardiovascular event.

## [Criticalquality attribute assessment of big brand traditional Chinese medicine: visualization method for quality control of Ginkgo Leaves Tablets based on spatial distribution uniformity].
 13.05.2021, _L Lin, FY Zhang, J Zhang, CF Ma, WZ Wang, LT Lei, JY Zhu, ZQ Yao, M Li, ZS Wu_


Spatial distribution uniformity is the critical quality attribute(CQA) of Ginkgo Leaves Tablets, a variety of big brand traditional Chinese medicine. The evaluation of the spatial distribution uniformity of active pharmaceutical ingredients(APIs) in Ginkgo Leaves Tablets is important in ensuring their stable and controllable quality. In this study, hyperspectral imaging technology was used to construct the spatial distribution map of API concentration based on three prediction models, further to realize the visualization research on the spatial distribution uniformity of Ginkgo Leaves Tablets. The region of interest(ROI) was selected from each Ginkgo Leaves Tablet, with length and width of 50 pixels, and a total of 2 500 pixels. Each pixel had 288 spectral channels, and the number of content prediction data could reach 1×10~5 for a single sample. The results of the three models showed that the Partial Least Squares(PLS) model had the highest prediction accuracy, with calibration set determination coefficient R_(pre)~2 of 0.987, prediction set determination coefficient R_(pre)~2 of 0.942, root mean square error of calibration(RMSEC) of 0.160%, and root mean square error of prediction(RMSEP) of 0.588%. The classical least-squares(CLS) model had a greater prediction error, with the RMSEP of 0.867%. Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Square(MCR-ALS) model showed the worst predictive ability among the three models, and it couldn't realize content prediction. Based on the prediction results of PLS and CLS models, the spatial distribution map of APIs concentration was obtained through three-dimensional data reconstruction. Furthermore, histogram method was used to evaluate the spatial distribution uniformity of API. The data showed that the spatial distribution of APIs in Ginkgo Leaves Tablets was relatively uniform. The study explored the feasibility of visualization of spatial distribution of Ginkgo Leaves Tablets based on three models. The results showed that PLS model had the highest prediction accuracy, and MCR-ALS model had the lowest prediction accuracy. The research results could provide a new strategy for the visualization method of quality control of Ginkgo Leaves Tablets.
