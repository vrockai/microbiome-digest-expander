Vaginal microbes and their metabolic products have crucial functions, affecting local immunity development and maternal-fetal health. The composition of the vaginal microbiome can vary in response to various factors, including body mass index (BMI), and diet. In this study we get new insights into the vaginal ecosystem of Caucasian women (n = 24) at the first trimester of pregnancy, assessing whether pre-pregnancy diet can affect the structure of the vaginal environment in terms of bacterial composition and vaginal metabolite concentration. We characterized 1) the vaginal bacterial composition (Nugent score), 2) the vaginal metabolic profiles (1H-NMR spectroscopy), and 3) the dietary nutrient intake by means of a validated food frequency questionnaire. Pre-pregnancy BMI was negatively related to vaginal health status, indicating that women who begin pregnancy overweight/obese have a greater occurrence of vaginal dysbiosis during pregnancy. A lactobacilli-dominated vaginal microbiota was negatively associated with higher pre-pregnancy intake of animal-sourced protein. Conversely, a higher pre-pregnancy consumption of total carbohydrates and sugars seemed to be a protective factor for vaginal health. The vaginal environment of BV-women was characterized by higher levels of biogenic amines and organic acids, whereas higher levels of phenylpropionate and diverse amino acids were fingerprints of a healthy vaginal status. A significant association between a higher pre-pregnancy BMI and several dysbiosis-related vaginal metabolites was also found. Our study shed light on the role of pre-pregnancy BMI and diet on the vaginal environment during pregnancy, underlining the importance of limiting protein intake from animal foods to maintain a healthy lactobacilli-dominated microbiota.

## Dynamic impact of virome on colitis and colorectal cancer: Immunity, inflammation, prevention and treatment.
 08.11.2021, _Z Wang, K Guo, Y Liu, C Huang, M Wu_


The gut microbiome includes a series of microorganism genomes, such as bacteriome, virome, mycobiome, etc. The gut microbiota is critically involved in intestine immunity and diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Clarifying the relationship between microbiota and inflammation may profoundly improve our understanding of etiology, disease progression, patient management, and the development of prevention and treatment. In this review, we discuss the latest studies of the influence of enteric viruses (i.e., commensal viruses, pathogenic viruses, and bacteriophages) in the initiation, progression, and complication of colitis and colorectal cancer, and their potential for novel preventative approaches and therapeutic application. We explore the interplay between gut viruses and host immune systems for its effects on the severity of inflammatory diseases and cancer, including both direct and indirect interactions between enteric viruses with other microbes and microbial products. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of the virome's roles in gut inflammatory response have been explained to infer potential therapeutic targets with examples in specific clinical trials. Given that very limited literature has thus far discussed these various topics with the gut virome, we believe these extensive analyses may provide insight into the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of IBD and CRC, which could help add the design of improved therapies for these important human diseases.

## HgS and Zuotai differ from HgCl2 and methyl mercury in intestinal Hg absorption, transporter expression and gut microbiome in mice.

Mercury (Hg) is generally considered as a toxic metal; yet the biological outcomes of Hg-containing compounds are highly dependent upon their chemical forms. We hypothesize that mercury sulfide (HgS) is different from HgCl2 and methylmercury (MeHg) in producing intestinal Hg absorption and disruption of gut microbiome. To test this hypothesis, mice were given orally with HgS (α-HgS, 30 mg/kg), Zuotai (β-HgS, 30 mg/kg), HgCl2 (33.6 mg/kg, equivalent Hg as HgS), or MeHg (3.1 mg/kg, 1/10 Hg as HgS) for 7 days. Accumulation of Hg in the duodenum and ileum after HgCl2 (30-40 fold) and MeHg (10-15 fold) was higher than HgS and Zuotai (~2-fold). HgCl2 and MeHg decreased intestinal intake peptide transporter-1 and Ost-β, and increased ileal bile acid binding protein and equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1. The efflux transporters ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member-4 (Abcc4), Abcg2, Abcg5/8, and Abcb1b were increased by HgCl2 and to a lesser extent by MeHg, while HgS and Zuotai had minimal effects. Bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S rDNA sequencing. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) results showed that among the 10 phyla, HgS increased Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, while HgCl2 increased Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and decreased Firmicutes; among the 79 families, HgS increased Rikenellaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Helicobacteraceae, and decreased Prevotellaceae, while HgCl2 increased Odoribacteraceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and decreased Lactobacillaceae; among the 232 genus/species, HgS and Zuotai affected gut microbiome quite differently from HgCl2 and MeHg. qPCR analysis with 16S rRNA confirmed sequencing results. Thus, chemical forms of mercury are a major determinant for intestinal Hg accumulation, alterations in transporters and disruption of microbiome.
