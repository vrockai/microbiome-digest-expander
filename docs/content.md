## The Microbial Conveyor Belt: Connecting the Globe through Dispersion and Dormancy.
 07.12.2020, _M Mestre, J HÃ¶fer_


Despite the recent increase in knowledge concerning microorganisms, the processes determining their global distribution and functioning have not been disentangled. Microbial dormant stages are adapted to endure specific adverse conditions related to their dispersion path, suggesting that dispersion is not entirely a stochastic process. Long-term dormancy enhances microbial dispersion, promoting the ubiquity of microorganisms. The evidence leads us to propose that there is a global, recurrent, and spatially cyclical dispersion of microorganisms that we have called the Microbial Conveyor Belt. These dispersion cycles directly influence the distribution of microorganisms, the global cycling of inorganic and organic matter, and thus the Earth system's functioning.

## Glycan utilization systems in the human gut microbiota: a gold mine for structural discoveries.
 07.12.2020, _K Tamura, H Brumer_


The complex glycans comprising 'dietary fiber' evade the limited repertoire of human digestive enzymes and hence feed the vast community of microbes in the lower gastrointestinal tract. As such, complex glycans drive the composition of the human gut microbiota and, in turn, influence diverse facets of our nutrition and health. To access these otherwise recalcitrant carbohydrates, gut bacteria produce coordinated, substrate-specific arsenals of carbohydrate-active enzymes, glycan-binding proteins, oligosaccharide transporters, and transcriptional regulators. A recent explosion of biochemical and enzymological studies of these systems has led to the discovery of manifold new carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) families. Crucially underpinned by structural biology, these studies have also provided unprecedented molecular insight into the exquisite specificity of glycan recognition in the diverse CAZymes and non-catalytic proteins from the HGM. The revelation of a multitude of new three-dimensional structures and substrate complexes constitutes a 'gold rush' in the structural biology of the human gut microbiota.

## The Oral Host-Microbial Interactome: An Ecological Chronometer of Health?
 06.12.2020, _M Freire, KE Nelson, A Edlund_


An increasing number of studies reveal that host-microbial interactome networks are coordinated, impacting human health and disease. Recently, several lines of evidence have revealed associations between the acquisition of a complex microbiota and adaptive immunity, supporting that host-microbiota symbiotic relationships have evolved as a means to maintain homeostasis where the role of the microbiota is to promote and educate the immune system. Here, we hypothesize an oral host-microbial interactome that could serve as an ecological chronometer of health and disease, with specific focus on caries, periodontal diseases, and cancer. We also review the current state of the art on the human oral microbiome and its correlations with host innate immunity, and host cytokine control, with the goal of using this information for disease prediction and designing novel treatments for local and systemic dysbiosis. In addition, we discuss new insights into the role of novel host-microbial signals as potential biomarkers, and their relevance for the future of precision dentistry and medicine.

## Impact of vaginal microbiome communities on HIV antiretroviral-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drug metabolism.
 03.12.2020, _RK Cheu, AT Gustin, C Lee, L Schifanella, CJ Miller, A Ha, C Kim, VJ Rodriguez, M Fischl, AD Burgener, KB Arnold, ML Alcaide, NR Klatt_


Despite the efficacy of antiretroviral-based pre-exposure prophylactics (PrEP) in men who have sex with men, studies in women have produced widely varying outcomes. Recent evidence demonstrates that vaginal microbial communities are associated with increased HIV acquisition risk and may impact PrEP efficacy. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying how vaginal bacteria alter PrEP drug levels and impact HIV infection rates ex vivo. Using cervicovaginal lavages (CVLs) from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (BV), we identified microbial metabolism of PrEP drugs in BV samples through LC-MS/MS analysis of soluble drug levels and metabolite formation in dual T-cell cultures. CVL samples were assessed for microbiome analysis using sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. We also observed non-Lactobacillus bacteria that are associated with BV may potentially impact PrEP efficacy through increased HIV infection rates in co-cultures containing Lactobacillus or BV bacteria, PrEP drugs, CEM-GFP cells, and HIV-1LAI virus. Finally, we used these data to develop a novel predictive mathematical simulation modeling system to predict these drug interactions for future trials. These studies demonstrate how dysbiotic vaginal microbiota may impact PrEP drugs and provides evidence linking vaginal bacteria to PrEP efficacy in women.

## Therapeutic potential of natural products against atherosclerosis: Targeting on gut microbiota.
 07.12.2020, _X Zhao, PK Oduro, W Tong, Y Wang, X Gao, Q Wang_


Gut microbiota (GM) has emerged as an essential and integral factor for maintaining human health and affecting pathological outcomes. Metagenomics and metabolomics characterization have furthered gut metagenome's understanding and unveiled that deviation of specific GM community members and GM-dependent metabolites balance orchestrate metabolic or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Restoring GM ecosystem with nutraceutical supplements keenly prebiotics and probiotics relatively decreases CVDs incidence and overall mortality. In Atherosclerosis, commensal and pathogenic gut microbes correlate with atherogenesis events. GM-dependent metabolites-trimethylamine N-oxide and short-chain fatty acids regulate atherosclerosis-related metabolic processes in opposite patterns to affect atherosclerosis outcomes. Therefore, GM might be a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis. In atherogenic animal models, natural products with cardioprotective properties could modulate the GM ecosystem by revitalizing healthier GM phylotypes and abrogating proatherogenic metabolites, paving future research paths and therapeutics.

## Distinct gut microbiotas between southern elephant seals and Weddell seals of Antarctica.
 03.12.2020, _M Kim, H Cho, WY Lee_


The gut microbiome provides ecological information about host animals, but we still have limited knowledge of the gut microbiome, particularly for animals inhabiting remote locations, such as Antarctica. Here, we compared fecal microbiota between southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddelli), that are top predatory marine mammals in the Antarctic ecosystem, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and assessed the relationships of the gut microbial communities to functional profiles using gut metabolite analysis. The bacterial community did not differ significantly by host species or sex at the phylum level, but the distinction at the family level was obvious. The family Ruminococcaceae (Firmicutes) was more abundant in southern elephant seals than in Weddell seals, and the families Acidaminococcaceae (Firmicutes) and Pasteurellaceae (Gammaproteobacteria) were uniquely present in Weddell seals. The fecal bacterial community structure was distinctively clustered by host species, with only 6.7% of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) shared between host species. This result implies that host phylogeny rather than other factors, such as diet or age, could be the major driver of fecal microbiotic diversification. Interestingly, there was no apparent sex effect on bacterial community structure in Weddell seals, but the effect of sex was pronounced in adult southern elephant seals mainly due to the prevalence of Edwardsiella sp., suggesting that extreme sexual dimorphism may modulate the gut microbiota of southern elephant seals. Unlike the clear distinction in the taxonomic composition of fecal bacterial communities, there were no discernible differences in the profiles of potential microbial functions and gut metabolites between host species or sexes, indicating that functional redundancy dominates the gut microbiota of seals surveyed in this study.

The Antarctic black meristematic fungus Cryomyces antarcticus CCFEE 515 occurs endolithically in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, one of the best analogue for Mars environment on Earth. To date, this fungus is considered one of the best eukaryotic models for astrobiological studies and has been repeatedly selected for space experiments in the last decade. The obtained results are reviewed here, with special focus on responses to space relevant irradiation, UV radiation, and both sparsely and densely ionizing radiation, which represent the major injuries for a putative space-traveller. The remarkable resistance of this model organism to space stress, its radioresistance in particular, and mechanisms involved, significantly contributed to expanding our concept of limits for life and provided new insights on the origin and evolution of life in planetary systems, habitability, and biosignatures for life detection as well as on human protection during space missions.

## MANTA, an integrative database and analysis platform that relates microbiome and phenotypic data.
 07.12.2020, _YA Chen, J Park, Y Natsume-Kitatani, H Kawashima, A Mohsen, K Hosomi, K Tanisawa, H Ohno, K Konishi, H Murakami, M Miyachi, J Kunisawa, K Mizuguchi_


With an ever-increasing interest in understanding the relationships between the microbiota and the host, more tools to map, analyze and interpret these relationships have been developed. Most of these tools, however, focus on taxonomic profiling and comparative analysis among groups, with very few analytical tools designed to correlate microbiota and the host phenotypic data. We have developed a software program for creating a web-based integrative database and analysis platform called MANTA (Microbiota And pheNoType correlation Analysis platform). In addition to storing the data, MANTA is equipped with an intuitive user interface that can be used to correlate the microbial composition with phenotypic parameters. Using a case study, we demonstrated that MANTA was able to quickly identify the significant correlations between microbial abundances and phenotypes that are supported by previous studies. Moreover, MANTA enabled the users to quick access locally stored data that can help interpret microbiota-phenotype relations. MANTA is available at https://mizuguchilab.org/manta/ for download and the source code can be found at https://github.com/chenyian-nibio/manta.
