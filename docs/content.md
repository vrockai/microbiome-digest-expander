Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, age-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects a large proportion of the elderly population. It currently lacks effective treatments, placing a heavy burden on patients, families, healthcare systems, and society. This is mainly due to our limited comprehension of the pathophysiology of AD progression, as well as the lack of effective drug targets and intervention timing to address the underlying pathology. AD is a multifactorial condition, and emerging evidence suggests that abnormalities in the gut microbiota play a significant role as environmental and multifaceted contributors to AD, although the exact mechanisms are yet to be fully explored. Changes in the composition of microbiota influence host neuronal health through their metabolites. These metabolites regulate intestinal epithelia, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and neuroinflammation by impacting mitochondrial function. The decline in the proportion of beneficial microbes and their essential metabolites during aging and AD is directly linked to poor mitochondrial function, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear. In this review, we discuss recent developments in understanding the impact of the microbiome and its metabolites on various cell types, their influence on the integrity of the gut and BBB barriers, systemic and brain inflammation, and cell-specific effects in AD pathology. This information is expected to pave the way for a new understanding of the interactions between microbiota and mitochondria in AD, providing a foundation for the development of novel treatments for AD.

## Genomic surveillance for antimicrobial resistance - a One Health perspective.
 25.09.2023, _SP Djordjevic, VM Jarocki, T Seemann, ML Cummins, AE Watt, B Drigo, ER Wyrsch, CJ Reid, E Donner, BP Howden_


Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) - the ability of microorganisms to adapt and survive under diverse chemical selection pressures - is influenced by complex interactions between humans, companion and food-producing animals, wildlife, insects and the environment. To understand and manage the threat posed to health (human, animal, plant and environmental) and security (food and water security and biosecurity), a multifaceted 'One Health' approach to AMR surveillance is required. Genomic technologies have enabled monitoring of the mobilization, persistence and abundance of AMR genes and mutations within and between microbial populations. Their adoption has also allowed source-tracing of AMR pathogens and modelling of AMR evolution and transmission. Here, we highlight recent advances in genomic AMR surveillance and the relative strengths of different technologies for AMR surveillance and research. We showcase recent insights derived from One Health genomic surveillance and consider the challenges to broader adoption both in developed and in lower- and middle-income countries.

## Lung Microbiome as a Treatable Trait in Chronic Respiratory Disorders.
 26.09.2023, _F Scial√≤, M Vitale, V D'Agnano, DF Mariniello, F Perrotta, A Castaldo, SFM Campbell, L Pastore, M Cazzola, A Bianco_


Once thought to be a sterile environment, it is now established that lungs are populated by various microorganisms that participate in maintaining lung function and play an important role in shaping lung immune surveillance. Although our comprehension of the molecular and metabolic interactions between microbes and lung cells is still in its infancy, any event causing a persistent qualitative or quantitative variation in the composition of lung microbiome, termed "dysbiosis", has been virtually associated with many respiratory diseases. A deep understanding of the composition and function of the "healthy" lung microbiota and how dysbiosis can cause or participate in disease progression will be pivotal in finding specific therapies aimed at preventing diseases and restoring lung function. Here, we review lung microbiome dysbiosis in different lung pathologies and the mechanisms by which these bacteria can cause or contribute to the severity of the disease. Furthermore, we describe how different respiratory disorders can be caused by the same pathogen, and that the real pathogenetic mechanism is not only dependent by the presence and amount of the main pathogen but can be shaped by the interaction it can build with other bacteria, fungi, and viruses present in the lung. Understanding the nature of this bacteria crosstalk could further our understanding of each respiratory disease leading to the development of new therapeutic strategies.

## Tomato growth stage modulates bacterial communities across different soil aggregate sizes and disease levels.
 29.09.2023, _M Dong, EE Kuramae, M Zhao, R Li, Q Shen, GA Kowalchuk_


Soil aggregates contain distinct physio-chemical properties across different size classes. These differences in micro-habitats support varied microbial communities and modulate the effect of plant on microbiome, which affect soil functions such as disease suppression. However, little is known about how the residents of different soil aggregate size classes are impacted by plants throughout their growth stages. Here, we examined how tomato plants impact soil aggregation and bacterial communities within different soil aggregate size classes. Moreover, we investigated whether aggregate size impacts the distribution of soil pathogen and their potential inhibitors. We collected samples from different tomato growth stages: before-planting, seedling, flowering, and fruiting stage. We measured bacterial density, community composition, and pathogen abundance using qPCR and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. We found the development of tomato growth stages negatively impacted root-adhering soil aggregation, with a gradual decrease of large macro-aggregates (1-2 mm) and an increase of micro-aggregates (&lt;0.25 mm). Additionally, changes in bacterial density and community composition varied across soil aggregate size classes. Furthermore, the pathogen exhibited a preference to micro-aggregates, while macro-aggregates hold a higher abundance of potential pathogen-inhibiting taxa and predicted antibiotic-associated genes. Our results indicate that the impacts of tomatoes on soil differ for different soil aggregate size classes throughout different plant growth stages, and plant pathogens and their potential inhibitors have different habitats within soil aggregate size classes. These findings highlight the importance of fine-scale heterogeneity of soil aggregate size classes in research on microbial ecology and agricultural sustainability, further research focuses on soil aggregates level could help identify candidate tax involved in suppressing pathogens in the virtual micro-habitats.

## Soil microbial diversity and network complexity drive the ecosystem multifunctionality of temperate grasslands under changing precipitation.
 26.09.2023, _C Zhai, L Han, C Xiong, A Ge, X Yue, Y Li, Z Zhou, J Feng, J Ru, J Song, L Jiang, Y Yang, L Zhang, S Wan_


Soil microbiomes play a critical role in regulating ecosystem multifunctionality. However, whether and how soil protists and microbiome interactions affect ecosystem multifunctionality under climate change is unclear. Here, we transplanted 54 soil monoliths from three typical temperate grasslands (i.e., desert, typical, and meadow steppes) along a precipitation gradient in the Mongolian Plateau and examined their response to nighttime warming, decreased, and increased precipitation. Across the three steppes, nighttime warming only stimulated protistan diversity by 15.61 (absolute change, phylogenetic diversity) but had no effect on ecosystem multifunctionality. Decreased precipitation reduced bacterial (8.78) and fungal (22.28) diversity, but significantly enhanced soil microbiome network complexity by 1.40. Ecosystem multifunctionality was reduced by 0.23 under decreased precipitation, which could be largely attributed to the reduced soil moisture that negatively impacted bacterial and fungal communities. In contrast, increased precipitation had little impact on soil microbial communities. Overall, both bacterial and fungal diversity and network complexity play a fundamental role in maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality in response to drought stress. Protists alter ecosystem multifunctionality by indirectly affecting microbial network complexity. Therefore, not only microbial diversity but also their interactions (regulated by soil protists) should be considered in evaluating the responses of ecosystem multifunctionality, which has important implications for predicting changes in ecosystem functioning under future climate change scenarios.

## Arctic bacterial diversity and connectivity in the coastal margin of the Last Ice Area.
 29.09.2023, _C Girard, WF Vincent, AI Culley_


Arctic climate change is leading to sea-ice attrition in the Last Ice Area along the northern coast of Canada and Greenland, but less attention has been given to the associated land-based ecosystems. Here we evaluated bacterial community structure in a hydrologically coupled cryo-ecosystem in the region: Thores Glacier, proglacial Thores Lake, and its outlet to the sea. Deep amplicon sequencing revealed that Polaromonas was ubiquitous, but differed genetically among diverse niches. Surface glacier-ice was dominated by Cyanobacteria, while the perennially ice-capped, well-mixed water column of Thores Lake had a unique assemblage of Chloroflexi, Actinobacteriota, and Planctomycetota. Species richness increased downstream, but glacier microbes were little detected in the lake, suggesting strong taxonomic sorting. Ongoing climate change and the retreat of Thores Glacier would lead to complete drainage and loss of the lake microbial ecosystem, indicating the extreme vulnerability of diverse cryohabitats and unique microbiomes in the Last Ice coastal margin.

The terrestrial subsurface is home to a significant proportion of the Earth's microbial biomass. Our understanding about terrestrial subsurface microbiomes is almost exclusively derived from groundwater and porous sediments mainly by using 16S rRNA gene surveys. To obtain more insights about biomass of consolidated rocks and the metabolic status of endolithic microbiomes, we investigated interbedded limestone and mudstone from the vadose zone, fractured aquifers, and deep aquitards.

## A computational method to dissect colonization resistance of the gut microbiota against pathogens.
 26.09.2023, _S Ke, Y Xiao, ST Weiss, X Chen, CP Kelly, YY Liu_


The mammalian gut microbiome protects the host through colonization resistance (CR) against the incursion of exogenous and often harmful microorganisms, but identifying the exact microbes responsible for the gut microbiota-mediated CR against a particular pathogen remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we developed a computational method: generalized microbe-phenotype triangulation (GMPT). We first systematically validated GMPT using a classical population dynamics model in community ecology and demonstrated its superiority over baseline methods. We then tested GMPT on simulated data generated from the ecological network inferred from a real community (GnotoComplex microflora) and real microbiome data on two mouse studies on Clostridioides difficile infection. We demonstrated GMPT's ability to streamline the discovery of microbes that are potentially responsible for microbiota-mediated CR against pathogens. GMPT holds promise to advance our understanding of CR mechanisms and facilitate the rational design of microbiome-based therapies for preventing and treating enteric infections.

## Evidence for the Beneficial Effects of Brazilian Native Fruits and Their By-Products on Human Intestinal Microbiota and Repercussions on Non-Communicable Chronic Diseases-A Review.
 28.09.2023, _MDC Lima, HMA do Nascimento, JYP da Silva, JL de Brito Alves, EL de Souza_


Non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) are the most widespread cause of mortality worldwide. Intestinal microbiota balance can be altered by changes in the abundance and/or diversity of intestinal microbiota, indicating a role of intestinal microbiota in NCD development. This review discusses the findings of in vitro studies, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials on the effects of Brazilian native fruits, their by-products, as well as their bioactive compounds on human intestinal microbiota and NCD. The major bioactive compounds in Brazilian native fruits and their by-products, and the impacts of their administration on outcomes linked to intestinal microbiota modulation are discussed. Mechanisms of intestinal microbiota affecting NCD could be linked to the modulation of absorption and energy balance, immune and endocrine systems, and inflammatory response. Brazilian native fruits, such as acerola, a√ßa√≠, baru, buriti, guava, jabuticaba, ju√ßara, and passion fruit, have several bioactive compounds, soluble and insoluble fibers, and a variety of phenolic compounds, which are capable of changing these key mechanisms. Brazilian native fruits and their by-products can help to promote positive intestinal and systemic health benefits by driving alterations in the composition of the human intestinal microbiota, and increasing the production of distinct short-chain fatty acids and phenolic metabolites, thereby enhancing intestinal integrity and homeostasis. Evidence from available literature shows that the modulatory impacts of Brazilian native fruits and their by-products on the composition and metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota could improve several clinical repercussions associated with NCD, reinforcing the influence of intestinal microbiota in extra-intestinal outcomes.
