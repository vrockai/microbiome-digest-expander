Recent studies indicate that the interplay between diet, intestinal microbiota composition, and intestinal permeability can impact mental health. More than 10% of children and adolescents in Iceland suffer from mental disorders, and rates of psychotropics use are very high. The aim of this novel observational longitudinal case-control study, "Meals, Microbiota and Mental Health in Children and Adolescents (MMM-Study)" is to contribute to the promotion of treatment options for children and adolescents diagnosed with mental disorders through identification of patterns that may affect the symptoms. All children and adolescents, 5-15 years referred to the outpatient clinic of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department at The National University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland, for one year (n≈150) will be invited to participate. There are two control groups, i.e., sex-matched children from the same postal area (n≈150) and same parent siblings (full siblings) in the same household close in age +/- 3 years (n&lt;150). A three-day food diary, rating scales for mental health, and multiple questionnaires will be completed. Biosamples (fecal-, urine-, saliva-, blood samples, and buccal swab) will be collected and used for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the oral and gut microbiome, measurements of serum factors, quantification of urine metabolites and host genotype, respectively. For longitudinal follow-up, data collection will be repeated after three years in the same groups. Integrative analysis of diet, gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, serum metabolites, and mental health will be conducted applying bioinformatics and systems biology approaches. Extensive population-based data of this quality has not been collected before, with collection repeated in three years' time, contributing to the high scientific value. The MMM-study follows the "Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology" (STROBE) guidelines. Approval has been obtained from the Icelandic National Bioethics Committee, and the study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov. The study will contribute to an improved understanding of the links between diet, gut microbiota and mental health in children through good quality study design by collecting information on multiple components, and a longitudinal approach. Furthermore, the study creates knowledge on possibilities for targeted and more personalized dietary and lifestyle interventions in subgroups. Trial registration numbers: VSN-19-225 &amp; NCT04330703.

## Bacteriological quality and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of isolates of ready-to-eat raw minced meat from hotels and restaurants in Arba Minch, Ethiopia.
 07.09.2022, _T Tonjo, A Manilal, M Seid_


In Ethiopia, the bacteriological quality of ready-to-eat raw meat is of a great public health concern as it can serve as a source of meat-borne pathogens and worsen the transmission of antimicrobial resistant bacteria, and hence this cross-sectional study, done on 257 meat samples (ie., 169 beef, 50 mutton and 38 chevon) from randomly selected hotels and restaurants (n = 52). Approximately 25 gm of meat samples were taken bi-weekly and subjected to quantitative and qualitative analyses; antimicrobial susceptibility tests were done as per the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. It was found that 13.2 (n = 34), 17.5 (n = 45) and 21.8% (n = 56) samples exceeded the permissible limit for total viable and coliform and S. aureus counts, respectively. At the same time, 24.9% (n = 64) surpassed the bacteriological limit permissible for consumption. Overall, 36.6% (n = 94) of samples were extrapolated as unsatisfactory for consumption due to high bacterial load and or the presence of pathogens. Five different bacterial spp. such as E. coli 65% (n = 167), S. aureus 59% (n = 152), Salmonella spp. 28.4% (n = 73), Campylobacter spp. 14.4% (n = 37) and Shigella spp. 4.3% (n = 11) were isolated in varied proportions. Alarmingly, 60% (n = 264) of the isolates were multi-drug resistant and 51% of S. aureus were found to be MRSA.

## Laboratory evaluation of RealStar Yellow Fever Virus RT-PCR kit 1.0 for potential use in the global yellow fever laboratory network.

Early detection of human yellow fever (YF) infection in YF-endemic regions is critical to timely outbreak mitigation. African National Laboratories chiefly rely on serological assays that require confirmation at Regional Reference Laboratories, thus delaying results, which themselves are not always definitive often due to antibody cross-reactivity. A positive molecular test result is confirmatory for YF; therefore, a standardized YF molecular assay would facilitate immediate confirmation at National Laboratories. The WHO-coordinated global Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics Laboratory Technical Working Group sought to independently evaluate the quality and performance of commercial YF molecular assays relevant to use in countries with endemic YF, in the absence of stringent premarket assessments. This report details a limited laboratory WHO-coordinated evaluation of the altona Diagnostics RealStar Yellow Fever Virus RT-PCR kit 1.0.

## Insufficient yet improving involvement of the global south in top sustainability science publications.

The creation of global research partnerships is critical to produce shared knowledge for the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Sustainability science promotes the coproduction of inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge, with the expectation that studies will be carried out through groups and truly collaborative networks. As a consequence, sustainability research, in particular that published in high impact journals, should lead the way in terms of ethical partnership in scientific collaboration. Here, we examined this issue through a quantitative analysis of the articles published in Nature Sustainability (300 papers by 2135 authors) and Nature (2994 papers by 46,817 authors) from January 2018 to February 2021. Focusing on these journals allowed us to test whether research published under the banner of sustainability science favoured a more equitable involvement of authors from countries belonging to different income categories, by using the journal Nature as a control. While the findings provide evidence of still insufficient involvement of Low-and-Low-Middle-Income-Countries (LLMICs) in Nature Sustainability publications, they also point to promising improvements in the involvement of such authors. Proportionally, there were 4.6 times more authors from LLMICs in Nature Sustainability than in Nature articles, and 68.8-100% of local Global South studies were conducted with host country scientists (reflecting the discouragement of parachute research practices), with local scientists participating in key research steps. We therefore provide evidence of the promising, yet still insufficient, involvement of low-income countries in top sustainability science publications and discuss ongoing initiatives to improve this.

## Adapt conservation biology teaching to address eco-anxiety in students.
 07.09.2022, _VA São Pedro, L Trierveiler-Pereira, JM Baltazar_


The fear of environmental doom (eco-anxiety) is a new and growing source of mental distress that could particularly affect the next generation of conservation biologists. With care and empathy, educators can help to prevent worsening the mental health of students.
