By studying the entire human faecal resistome and associated microbiome, the diversity and abundance of faecal antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) can be comprehensively characterized. Prior culture-based studies have shown associations between occupational exposure to livestock and carriage of specific antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Using shotgun metagenomics, the present study investigated 194 faecal resistomes and bacteriomes from humans occupationally exposed to ARGs in livestock (i.e. pig and poultry farmers, employees and family members and pig slaughterhouse workers) and a control population (Lifelines cohort) in the Netherlands. In addition, we sought to identify determinants for the human resistome and bacteriome composition by applying a combination of multivariate (NMDS, PERMANOVA, SIMPER and DESeq2 analysis) and multivariable regression analysis techniques.

## Gut microbiota in dementia. Critical review of novel findings and their potential application.

There is a great deal of impetus for the comprehensive understanding of the complete pathological function, genetic information, and functional diversity of the gut microbiota that favors the development of dementia. It has been reported that patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease present with several metabolic and immune-inflammatory alterations. The recently highlighted aspects of human health linked to cognitive decline include insulin-resistance, obesity, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Gut microbiota is known to produce neurotransmitters, such as GABA, acetylcholine, dopamine or serotonin, vitamins, intestinal toxins, and modulate nerve signaling - with emphasis on the vagus nerve. Additionally, gut dysbiosis results in impaired synthesis of signaling proteins affecting metabolic processes relevant to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Due to numerous links of gut microbiota to crucial metabolic and inflammatory pathways, attempts aimed at correcting the gut microflora composition may affect dementia pathology in a pleiotropic manner. Taking advantage of the metabolic effects of cold exposure on organisms by the introduction of whole-body cryostimulation in dementia patients could lead to alterations in gut microbiota and, therefore, decrease of an inflammatory response and insulin resistance, which remain one of the critical metabolic features of dementia. Further studies are needed in order to explore the potential application of recent findings and ways of achieving the desired goals.

## Higher tree diversity increases soil microbial resistance to drought.

Predicted increases in drought frequency and severity may change soil microbial functioning. Microbial resistance and recovery to drought depend on plant community characteristics, among other factors, yet how changes in plant diversity modify microbial drought responses is uncertain. Here, we assessed how repeated drying-rewetting cycles affect soil microbial functioning and whether tree species diversity modifies these effects with a microcosm experiment using soils from different European forests. Our results show that microbial aerobic respiration and denitrification decline under drought but are similar in single and mixed tree species forests. However, microbial communities from mixed forests resist drought better than those from mono-specific forests. This positive tree species mixture effect is robust across forests differing in environmental conditions and species composition. Our data show that mixed forests mitigate drought effects on soil microbial processes, suggesting greater stability of biogeochemical cycling in mixed forests should drought frequency increase in the future.
