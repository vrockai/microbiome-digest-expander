## Phylogenetic Core Groups: a promising concept in search of a consistent methodological framework : Comment to ``A conceptual framework for the phylogenetically-constrained assembly of microbial communities''.
 28.03.2021, _A Pascual-García_


In this comment, we analyse the conceptual framework proposed by Aguirre de Cárcer (Microbiome 7:142, 2019), introducing the novel concept of Phylogenetic Core Groups (PCGs). This notion aims to complement the traditional classification in operational taxonomic units (OTUs), widely used in microbial ecology, to provide a more intrinsic taxonomical classification which avoids the use of pre-determined thresholds. However, to introduce this concept, the author frames his proposal in a wider theoretical framework based on a conceptualization of selection that we argue is a tautology. This blurs the subsequent formulation of an assembly principle for microbial communities, favouring that some contradictory examples introduced to support the framework appear aligned in their conclusions. And more importantly, under this framework and its derived methodology, it is not possible to infer PCGs from data in a consistent way. We reanalyse the proposal to identify its logical and methodological flaws and, through the analysis of synthetic scenarios, we propose a number of methodological refinements to contribute towards the determination of PCGs in a consistent way. We hope our analysis will promote the exploration of PCGs as a potentially valuable tool, helping to bridge the gap between environmental conditions and community composition in microbial ecology.

## Opportunistic bacteria with reduced genomes are effective competitors for organic nitrogen compounds in coastal dinoflagellate blooms.
 28.03.2021, _Y Han, N Jiao, Y Zhang, F Zhang, C He, X Liang, R Cai, Q Shi, K Tang_


Phytoplankton blooms are frequent events in coastal areas and increase the production of organic matter that initially shapes the growth of opportunistic heterotrophic bacteria. However, it is unclear how these opportunists are involved in the transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) when blooms occur and the subsequent impacts on biogeochemical cycles.

## Metagenomic insights into the taxonomy, function, and dysbiosis of prokaryotic communities in octocorals.
 28.03.2021, _T Keller-Costa, A Lago-Lestón, JP Saraiva, R Toscan, SG Silva, J Gonçalves, CJ Cox, N Kyrpides, U Nunes da Rocha, R Costa_


In octocorals (Cnidaria Octocorallia), the functional relationship between host health and its symbiotic consortium has yet to be determined. Here, we employed comparative metagenomics to uncover the distinct functional and phylogenetic features of the microbiomes of healthy Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa, and Leptogorgia sarmentosa tissues, in contrast with the microbiomes found in seawater and sediments. We further explored how the octocoral microbiome shifts to a pathobiome state in E. gazella.

## Age and sex-associated variation in the multi-site microbiome of an entire social group of free-ranging rhesus macaques.
 26.03.2021, _MC Janiak, MJ Montague, CI Villamil, MK Stock, AE Trujillo, AN DePasquale, JD Orkin, SE Bauman Surratt, O Gonzalez, ML Platt, MI Martínez, SC Antón, MG Dominguez-Bello, AD Melin, JP Higham_


An individual's microbiome changes over the course of its lifetime, especially during infancy, and again in old age. Confounding factors such as diet and healthcare make it difficult to disentangle the interactions between age, health, and microbial changes in humans. Animal models present an excellent opportunity to study age- and sex-linked variation in the microbiome, but captivity is known to influence animal microbial abundance and composition, while studies of free-ranging animals are typically limited to studies of the fecal microbiome using samples collected non-invasively. Here, we analyze a large dataset of oral, rectal, and genital swabs collected from 105 free-ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta, aged 1 month-26 years), comprising one entire social group, from the island of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. We sequenced 16S V4 rRNA amplicons for all samples.

## Holo-omics for deciphering plant-microbiome interactions.
 28.03.2021, _L Xu, G Pierroz, HM Wipf, C Gao, JW Taylor, PG Lemaux, D Coleman-Derr_


Host-microbiome interactions are recognized for their importance to host health. An improved understanding of the molecular underpinnings of host-microbiome relationships will advance our capacity to accurately predict host fitness and manipulate interaction outcomes. Within the plant microbiome research field, unlocking the functional relationships between plants and their microbial partners is the next step to effectively using the microbiome to improve plant fitness. We propose that strategies that pair host and microbial datasets-referred to here as holo-omics-provide a powerful approach for hypothesis development and advancement in this area. We discuss several experimental design considerations and present a case study to highlight the potential for holo-omics to generate a more holistic perspective of molecular networks within the plant microbiome system. In addition, we discuss the biggest challenges for conducting holo-omics studies; specifically, the lack of vetted analytical frameworks, publicly available tools, and required technical expertise to process and integrate heterogeneous data. Finally, we conclude with a perspective on appropriate use-cases for holo-omics studies, the need for downstream validation, and new experimental techniques that hold promise for the plant microbiome research field. We argue that utilizing a holo-omics approach to characterize host-microbiome interactions can provide important opportunities for broadening system-level understandings and significantly inform microbial approaches to improving host health and fitness.

## Much ado about nothing? Off-target amplification can lead to false-positive bacterial brain microbiome detection in healthy and Parkinson's disease individuals.
 29.03.2021, _JR Bedarf, N Beraza, H Khazneh, E Özkurt, D Baker, V Borger, U Wüllner, F Hildebrand_


Recent studies suggested the existence of (poly-)microbial infections in human brains. These have been described either as putative pathogens linked to the neuro-inflammatory changes seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) or as a "brain microbiome" in the context of healthy patients' brain samples.

## Cross-kingdom inhibition of bacterial virulence and communication by probiotic yeast metabolites.
 28.03.2021, _O Malka, D Kalson, K Yaniv, R Shafir, M Rajendran, O Ben-David, A Kushmaro, MM Meijler, R Jelinek_


Probiotic milk-fermented microorganism mixtures (e.g., yogurt, kefir) are perceived as contributing to human health, and possibly capable of protecting against bacterial infections. Co-existence of probiotic microorganisms are likely maintained via complex biomolecular mechanisms, secreted metabolites mediating cell-cell communication, and other yet-unknown biochemical pathways. In particular, deciphering molecular mechanisms by which probiotic microorganisms inhibit proliferation of pathogenic bacteria would be highly important for understanding both the potential benefits of probiotic foods as well as maintenance of healthy gut microbiome.

## Revealing taxon-specific heavy metal-resistance mechanisms in denitrifying phosphorus removal sludge using genome-centric metaproteomics.
 26.03.2021, _Y Lin, L Wang, K Xu, K Li, H Ren_


Denitrifying phosphorus removal sludge (DPRS) is widely adopted for nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment but faces threats from heavy metals. However, a lack of understanding of the taxon-specific heavy metal-resistance mechanisms hinders the targeted optimization of DPRS's robustness in nutrient removal.

## Direct impact of commonly used dietary emulsifiers on human gut microbiota.
 26.03.2021, _S Naimi, E Viennois, AT Gewirtz, B Chassaing_


Epidemiologic evidence and animal studies implicate dietary emulsifiers in contributing to the increased prevalence of diseases associated with intestinal inflammation, including inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic syndrome. Two synthetic emulsifiers in particular, carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate 80, profoundly impact intestinal microbiota in a manner that promotes gut inflammation and associated disease states. In contrast, the extent to which other food additives with emulsifying properties might impact intestinal microbiota composition and function is not yet known.
