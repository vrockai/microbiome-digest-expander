Research on the gut-brain axis has accelerated substantially over the course of the last years. Many reviews have outlined the important implications of understanding the relation of the gut microbiota with human brain function and behavior. One substantial drawback in integrating gut microbiome and brain data is the lack of integrative multivariate approaches that enable capturing variance in both modalities simultaneously. To address this issue, we applied a linked independent component analysis (LICA) to microbiota and brain connectivity data.We analyzed data from 58 healthy females (mean age = 21.5 years). Magnetic Resonance Imaging data were acquired using resting state functional imaging data. The assessment of gut microbial composition from feces was based on sequencing of the V4 16S rRNA gene region. We used the LICA model to simultaneously factorize the subjects' large-scale brain networks and microbiome relative abundance data into 10 independent components of spatial and abundance variation.LICA decomposition resulted in four components with non-marginal contribution of the microbiota data. The default mode network featured strongly in three components, whereas the two-lateralized fronto-parietal attention networks contributed to one component. The executive-control (with the default mode) network was associated to another component. We found that the abundance of Prevotella genus was associated with the strength of expression of all networks, whereas Bifidobacterium was associated with the default mode and frontoparietal-attention networks.We provide the first exploratory evidence for multivariate associative patterns between the gut microbiota and brain network connectivity in healthy humans considering the complexity of both systems.

We explored opportunities for personalized and predictive health care by collecting serial clinical measurements, health surveys, genomics, proteomics, autoantibodies, metabolomics, and gut microbiome data from 96 individuals who participated in a data-driven health coaching program over a 16-month period with continuous digital monitoring of activity and sleep. We generated a resource of &gt;20,000 biological samples from this study and a compendium of &gt;53 million primary data points for 558,032 distinct features. Multiomics factor analysis revealed distinct and independent molecular factors linked to obesity, diabetes, liver function, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, immunity, exercise, diet, and hormonal effects. For example, ethinyl estradiol, a common oral contraceptive, produced characteristic molecular and physiological effects, including increased levels of inflammation and impact on thyroid, cortisol levels, and pulse, that were distinct from other sources of variability observed in our study. In total, this work illustrates the value of combining deep molecular and digital monitoring of human health. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

## A specific structure and high richness characterize intestinal microbiota of HIV-exposed seronegative individuals.
 02.12.2021, _TJ Lopera, JA Lujan, E Zurek, W Zapata, JC Hernandez, MA Toro, JF Alzate, NA Taborda, MT Rugeles, W Aguilar-Jimenez_


Intestinal microbiota facilitates food breakdown for energy metabolism and influences the immune response, maintaining mucosal homeostasis. Overall, HIV infection is associated with intestinal dysbiosis and immune activation, which has been related to seroconversion in HIV-exposed individuals. However, it is unclear whether microbiota dysbiosis is the cause or the effect of immune alterations and disease progression or if it could modulate the risk of acquiring the HIV infection. We characterize the intestinal microbiota and determine its association with immune regulation in HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESN), HIV-infected progressors (HIV+), and healthy control (HC) subjects. For this, feces and blood were collected. The microbiota composition of HESN showed a significantly higher alpha (p = 0.040) and beta diversity (p = 0.006) compared to HC, but no differences were found compared to HIV+. A lower Treg percentage was observed in HESN (1.77%) than HC (2.98%) and HIV+ (4.02%), with enrichment of the genus Butyrivibrio (p = 0.029) being characteristic of this profile. Moreover, we found that Megasphaera (p = 0.017) and Victivallis (p = 0.0029) also are enriched in the microbiota composition in HESN compared to HC and HIV+ subjects. Interestingly, an increase in Succinivibrio and Prevotella, and a reduction in Bacteroides genus, which is typical of HIV-infected individuals, were observed in both HESN and HIV+, compared to HC. Thus, HESNs have a microbiota profile, similar to that observed in HIV+, most likely because HESN are cohabiting with their HIV+ partners.

## Central role of intestinal epithelial glucocorticoid receptor in alcohol- and corticosterone-induced gut permeability and systemic response.
 03.12.2021, _PK Shukla, AS Meena, JF Pierre, R Rao_


Corticosterone, the stress hormone, exacerbates alcohol-associated tissue injury, but the mechanism involved is unknown. We examined the role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in corticosterone-mediated potentiation of alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction and systemic response. Hepatocyte-specific GR-deficient (GRΔHC ) and intestinal epithelial-specific GR-deficient (GRΔIEC ) mice were fed ethanol, combined with corticosterone treatment. Intestinal epithelial tight junction integrity, mucosal barrier function, microbiota dysbiosis, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, liver damage, and neuroinflammation were assessed. Corticosterone potentiated ethanol-induced epithelial tight junction disruption, mucosal permeability, and inflammatory response in GRΔHC mouse colon; these effects of ethanol and corticosterone were absent in GRΔIEC mice. Gut microbiota compositions in ethanol-fed GRΔHC and GRΔIEC mice were similar to each other. However, corticosterone treatment in ethanol-fed mice shifted the microbiota composition to distinctly different directions in GRΔHC and GRΔIEC mice. Ethanol and corticosterone synergistically elevated the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli and reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus in GRΔHC mice but not in GRΔIEC mice. In GRΔHC mice, corticosterone potentiated ethanol-induced endotoxemia and systemic inflammation, but these effects were absent in GRΔIEC mice. Interestingly, ethanol-induced liver damage and its potentiation by corticosterone were observed in GRΔHC mice but not in GRΔIEC mice. GRΔIEC mice were also resistant to ethanol- and corticosterone-induced inflammatory response in the hypothalamus. These data indicate that the intestinal epithelial GR plays a central role in alcohol- and corticosterone-induced gut barrier dysfunction, microbiota dysbiosis, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, liver damage, and neuroinflammation. This study identifies a novel target for potential therapeutic for alcohol-associated tissue injury.

## Novel Strategies for Inhibition of Bacterial Biofilm in Chronic Rhinosinusitis.
 02.12.2021, _A Shariati, S Vesal, A Khoshbayan, P Goudarzi, D Darban-Sarokhali, S Razavi, M Didehdar, Z Chegini_


An important role has been recently reported for bacterial biofilm in the pathophysiology of chronic diseases, such as Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS). CRS, affecting sinonasal mucosa, is a persistent inflammatory condition with a high prevalence around the world. Although the exact pathological mechanism of this disease has not been elicited yet, biofilm formation is known to lead to a more significant symptom burden and major objective clinical indicators. The high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has severely restricted the application of antibiotics in recent years. Furthermore, systemic antibiotic therapy, on top of its insufficient concentration to eradicate bacteria in the sinonasal biofilm, often causes toxicity, antibiotic resistance, and an effect on the natural microbiota, in patients. Thus, coming up with alternative therapeutic options instead of systemic antibiotic therapy is emphasized in the treatment of bacterial biofilm in CRS patients. The use of topical antibiotic therapy and antibiotic eluting sinus stents that induce higher antibiotic concentration, and decrease side effects could be helpful. Besides, recent research recognized that various natural products, nitric oxide, and bacteriophage therapy, in addition to the hindered biofilm formation, could degrade the established bacterial biofilm. However, despite these improvements, new antibacterial agents and CRS biofilm interactions are complicated and need extensive research. Finally, most studies were performed in vitro, and more preclinical animal models and human studies are required to confirm the collected data. The present review is specifically discussing potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of bacterial biofilm in CRS patients.

## Seed inhabiting bacterial endophytes of maize promote seedling establishment and provide protection against fungal disease.
 02.12.2021, _G Pal, K Kumar, A Verma, SK Verma_


Bacteria from different crops and plant varieties have been shown to possess enormous growth promotional attributes. The study aimed to investigate the role of the endophytic microbiome of seeds of corn in improving the growth of seedlings of two different varieties of maize crops (K-25 and baby corn). Furthermore, the study also assessed the role of these bacteria in the protection of seedlings from fungal pathogens. Total twenty-three endophytic bacterial strains were isolated from maize seeds and identified using 16S rDNA sequencing. Most of the isolates had the ability to synthesize auxin (70 %) and solubilize phosphate (74 %), while all the isolates showed nitrogen fixation ability. Some isolates also showed antagonistic activity against phytopathogenic fungi including Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium sp. suggesting their biocontrol potential. The presence of different lipopeptide genes including bacillomycin D, fengycin, iturin A and surfactin was confirmed in some of the isolates. We observed that treating seeds with an antibiotic compromised the seedlings' growth; however, re-inoculation with endophytic isolates (ZM1/Lysinibacillus sp. and ZM2/Paenibacillus dendritiformis) restored the growth of the seedlings in terms of improved root and shoot development in comparison to non-inoculated controls. The colonization of inoculated bacteria on the root surface was visualized using fluorescent microscopy. Seedling protection assay showed that treated seeds (with ZMW8/ Bacillus velezensis) were protected from fungal infestation (Fusarium verticillioides) even after 12 days of inoculation in comparison to the uninoculated control. The study concludes that indigenous seed-associated bacteria of maize play a major role during seed germination, seedling formation and protect them from phytopathogens.
