Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump.

Vaginitis is a prevalent clinical disorder associated with several adverse health consequences, prompting women to seek medical care. In this study we evaluate the Vaginal Panel Real-Time PCR kit (qPCR test) against routinely used diagnostics for detection of bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomoniasis. A total of 1011 vaginal swab specimens were analyzed. The routinely diagnostic methods for BV was Gram stain-based Nugent score. VVC presence was detected by culture, and Candida species were identified using MALDI-TOF MS. Trichomonas vaginalis was identified by culture in a selective medium. Molecular analyses were conducted on the MagXtract® 3200 System and analyzed using the CFX96™ Real-Time PCR Detection System. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the qPCR test compared to the reference method for BV diagnosis was 93.1%, 88.8%, 90.1% and 92.2%, respectively, with a Kappa value of 0.82. For Candida species, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 96.0%, 98.4%, 95.3%, and 98.7%, respectively. The qPCR test detected 32 additional positive samples for Candida not reported by the routinely used diagnostics. For trichomoniasis, the qPCR test identified T. vaginalis in fifteen specimens, despite no microscopic detection in cultured specimens. Our results demonstrate that the Vaginal Panel Real-Time PCR kit shows optimal concordance with routinely used diagnostics for diagnosing vaginitis. Furthermore, enhancing detection of T. vaginalis. However, further validation studies are necessary to confirm its full diagnostic accuracy. The use of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) provides rapid and accurate diagnosis, crucial for early detection and treatment of vaginitis.

## The gut microbiome in patients with Cushing's disease affects depression- and anxiety-like behavior in mice.

Depression and anxiety significantly impact the quality of life in individuals with Cushing's disease (CD), which originates from pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs), yet our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is limited. There is substantial evidence linking gut microbes to depression, anxiety, and endocrinology.

## Novel fermentations integrate traditional practice and rational design of fermented-food microbiomes.
 05.11.2024, _D Arrigan, CI Kothe, A Oliverio, JD Evans, BE Wolfe_


_Fermented Foods, Fermentation, Microbiota, Food Microbiology, Humans_
Fermented foods and beverages have been produced around the world for millennia, providing humans with a range of gastronomic, cultural, health, and scientific benefits. Building on these traditional forms, a convergence of factors, including culinary innovation, globalization, shifts in consumer preferences, and advances in microbiome sciences, has led to the emergence of so-called 'novel fermentations'. In this review, we define novel fermentation as the confluence of traditional food practices and rational microbiome design. Using principles of microbial ecology and evolution, we develop a microbiological framework that outlines several strategies for producing and characterizing novel fermentations, including switching substrates, engrafting target species, assembling whole-community chimeras, and generating novel phenotypes. A subsequent analysis of existing traditional ferments points to gaps in 'fermentation space' where novel ferments could potentially be produced using new combinations of microbes and food substrates. We highlight some important safety and sociocultural issues presented by the repurposing and modification of microbes from traditional ferments that fermented-food producers and microbiologists need to address.
