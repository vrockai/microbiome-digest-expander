The host microbiome is polymorphic, compartmentalized, and composed of distinctive tissue microbiomes. While research in the field of cancer immunotherapy has provided an improved understanding of the interaction with the gastrointestinal microbiome, the significance of the tumor-associated microbiome has only recently been grasped. This article provides a state-of-the-art review about the tumor-associated microbiome and sheds light on how local tumor microbiota shapes anticancer immunity and influences checkpoint immunotherapy outcome. The direct route of interaction between cancer cells, immune cells, and microbiota in the tumor microenvironment is emphasized and advocates a focus on the tumor-associated microbiome in addition to the spatially separated gut compartment. Since the mechanisms underlying checkpoint immunotherapy modulation by tumor-associated microbiota remain largely elusive, future research should dissect the pathways involved and outline strategies to therapeutically modulate microbes and their products within the tumor microenvironment. A more detailed knowledge about the mechanisms governing the composition and functional quality of the tumor microbiome will improve cancer immunotherapy and advance precision medicine for solid tumors.

## The Upper-Airway Microbiome as a Biomarker of Asthma Exacerbations despite Inhaled Corticosteroid Treatment.
 07.11.2022, _J Perez-Garcia, M González-Carracedo, A Espuela-Ortiz, JM Hernández-Pérez, R González-Pérez, O Sardón-Prado, E Martin-Gonzalez, E Mederos-Luis, P Poza-Guedes, P Corcuera-Elosegui, A Callero, I Sánchez-Machín, J Korta-Murua, JA Pérez-Pérez, J Villar, M Pino-Yanes, F Lorenzo-Diaz_


The response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in asthma is affected by the interplay of several factors. Among these, the role of the upper-airway microbiome has been scarcely investigated. We aimed to evaluate the association between the salivary, pharyngeal, and nasal microbiome with asthma exacerbations despite ICS use.

## Manipulating the microbiome to enhance oral tolerance in food allergy.
 10.11.2022, _M Gonzalez-Visiedo, MD Kulis, DM Markusic_


Loss of oral tolerance (OT) to food antigens results in food allergies. One component of achieving OT is the symbiotic microorganisms living in the gut (microbiota). The composition of the microbiota can drive either pro-tolerogenic or pro-inflammatory responses against dietary antigens though interactions with the local immune cells within the gut. Products from bacterial fermentation, such as butyrate, are one of the main communication molecules involved in this interaction, however, this is released by a subset of bacterial species. Thus, strategies to specifically expand these bacteria with protolerogenic properties have been explored to complement oral immunotherapy in food allergy. These approaches either provide digestible biomolecules to induce beneficial bacteria species (prebiotics) or the direct administration of live bacteria species (probiotics). While this combined therapy has shown positive outcomes in clinical trials for cow's milk allergy, more research is needed to determine if this therapy can be extended to other food allergens.

## Longitudinal transkingdom gut microbial approach towards decompensation in outpatients with cirrhosis.

First decompensation development is a critical milestone that needs to be predicted. Transkingdom gut microbial interactions, including archaeal methanogens, may be important targets and predictors but a longitudinal approach is needed.

## Happy ageing by trusting our gut microbes.
 09.11.2022, _A Jayaraman, S Pettersson_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Aging, Diet, Neurodegenerative Diseases_
The human gut microbiota comprises of trillions of micro-organisms in the gut some which secrete metabolites that play a pivotal role in supporting optimal body and organ functions. These dynamic and malleable gut microbes share a bidirectional relationship with their hosts that supports health in an age- and sex-dependent manner. Disruption of the gut microbiota or decrease in their diversity and richness due to unhealthy changes in lifestyle, diet or social disconnection, always results in unwanted outcomes on the host health which fuel chronic disease symptoms including neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, impairment of gut microbiota composition, results in organ decline that accelerates an individual's biological ageing. Here we review evidence supporting the bidirectional relationships between the gut microbiota and biological ageing.

## Curcumin improves insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet-fed mice through gut microbiota.
 08.11.2022, _Y Zhong, Y Xiao, J Gao, Z Zheng, Z Zhang, L Yao, D Li_


Insulin resistance precedes metabolic syndrome which increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, there is a lack of safe and long-lasting methods for the prevention and treatment of insulin resistance. Gut microbiota dysbiosis can lead to insulin resistance and associated glucose and lipid metabolic dysfunction. Thus, the role of gut microbiota in metabolic diseases has garnered growing interest. Curcumin, the active ingredient of tropical plant Curcuma longa, has excellent prospects for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. However, due to the extremely low bioavailability of curcumin, the mechanisms by which curcumin increases insulin sensitivity remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to elucidate the role of gut microbiota in mediating the effects of curcumin on improving insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice.

## Differential Bacterial Community of Bee Bread and Bee Pollen Revealed by 16s rRNA High-Throughput Sequencing.
 30.10.2022, _S Ghosh, SM Namin, C Jung_


We investigated the bacterial community of bee bread and bee pollen samples using an approach through 16 s rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The results revealed a higher bacterial diversity in bee bread than in bee pollen as depicted in taxonomic profiling, as well as diversity indices such as the Shannon diversity index (3.7 to 4.8 for bee bread and 1.1 to 1.7 for bee pollen samples) and Simpson's index (&amp;gt;0.9 for bee bread and 0.4-0.5 for bee pollen). Principal component analysis showed a distinct difference in bacterial communities. The higher bacterial diversity in the bee bread than bee pollen could presumably be due to factors such as storage period, processing of food, fermentation, and high sugar environment. However, no effect of the feed (rapeseed or oak pollen patties or even natural inflow) was indicated on the bacterial composition of bee bread, presumably because of the lack of restriction of foraged pollen inflow in the hive. The diverse bacterial profile of the bee bread could contribute to the nutritional provisioning as well as enhance the detoxification process; however, a thorough investigation of the functional role of individual bacteria genera remains a task for future studies.
