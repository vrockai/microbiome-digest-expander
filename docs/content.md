Airborne bacteria are an influential component of the Earth's microbiomes, but their community structure and biogeographic distribution patterns have yet to be understood. We analyzed the bacterial communities of 370 air particulate samples collected from 63 sites around the world and constructed an airborne bacterial reference catalog with more than 27 million nonredundant 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. We present their biogeographic pattern and decipher the interlacing of the microbiome co-occurrence network with surface environments of the Earth. While the total abundance of global airborne bacteria in the troposphere (1.72 × 1024 cells) is 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of other habitats, the number of bacterial taxa (i.e., richness) in the atmosphere (4.71 × 108 to 3.08 × 109) is comparable to that in the hydrosphere, and its maximum occurs in midlatitude regions, as is also observed in other ecosystems. The airborne bacterial community harbors a unique set of dominant taxa (24 species); however, its structure appears to be more easily perturbed, due to the more prominent role of stochastic processes in shaping community assembly. This is corroborated by the major contribution of surface microbiomes to airborne bacteria (averaging 46.3%), while atmospheric conditions such as meteorological factors and air quality also play a role. Particularly in urban areas, human impacts weaken the relative importance of plant sources of airborne bacteria and elevate the occurrence of potential pathogens from anthropogenic sources. These findings serve as a key reference for predicting planetary microbiome responses and the health impacts of inhalable microbiomes with future changes in the environment.

## The Wound Microbiome.
 11.10.2022, _EK White, EA Grice_


Breach of the skin barrier and subsequent wound healing occur in the context of microbial communities of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. These polymicrobial communities are dynamic and important components of the wound environment and are associated with differential healing outcomes. Here, we highlight both culture-dependent and -independent methods that have furthered our understanding of the wound microbiome. We discuss common themes that have developed from such studies about the microbial inhabitants of diverse wound types. We additionally explore the wide range of microbial mechanisms that influence healing, from invading pathogens to beneficial commensals. These insights can be leveraged to better predict healing outcomes and derive novel microbial-based therapies for chronic wounds.

Integrative analysis approaches of metagenomics and metabolomics have been widely developed to understand the association between disease and the gut microbiome. However, the different profiling patterns of different metabolic samples in the association analysis make it a matter of concern which type of sample is the most closely associated with gut microbes and disease. To address this lack of knowledge, we investigated the association between the gut microbiome and metabolomic profiles of stool, urine, and plasma samples from ischemic stroke patients and healthy subjects.

## Gut-Testis Axis: Microbiota Prime Metabolome To Increase Sperm Quality in Young Type 2 Diabetes.
 10.10.2022, _X Yan, Y Feng, Y Hao, R Zhong, Y Jiang, X Tang, D Lu, H Fang, M Agarwal, L Chen, Y Zhao, H Zhang_


Young type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects 15% of the population, with a noted increase in cases, and T2D-related male infertility has become a serious issue in recent years. The current study aimed to explore the improvements of alginate oligosaccharide (AOS)-modified gut microbiota on semen quality in T2D. The T2D was established in young mice of 5 weeks of age with a blood glucose level of 21.2 ± 2.2 mmol/L, while blood glucose was 8.7 ± 1.1 mM in control animals. We discovered that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of AOS-improved microbiota (A10-FMT) significantly decreased blood glucose, while FMT of gut microbiota from control animals (Con-FMT) did not. Sperm concentration and motility were decreased in T2D to 10% to 20% of those in the control group, while A10-FMT brought about a recovery of around 5- to 10-fold. A10-FMT significantly increased small intestinal Allobaculum, while it elevated small intestinal and cecal Lactobacillus in some extent, blood butyric acid and derivatives and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and testicular docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), EPA, and testosterone and its derivatives. Furthermore, A10-FMT improved liver functions and systemic antioxidant environments. Most importantly, A10-FMT promoted spermatogenesis through the improvement in the expression of proteins important for spermatogenesis to increase sperm concentration and motility. The underlying mechanisms may be that A10-FMT increased gut-beneficial microbes Lactobacillus and Allobaculum to elevate blood and/or testicular butyric acid, DHA, EPA, and testosterone to promote spermatogenesis and thus to ameliorate sperm concentration and motility. AOS-improved gut microbes could emerge as attractive candidates to treat T2D-diminished semen quality. IMPORTANCE A10-FMT benefits gut microbiota, liver function, and systemic environment via improvement in blood metabolome, consequently to favor the testicular microenvironment to improve spermatogenesis process and to boost T2D-diminished semen quality. We established that AOS-improved gut microbiota may be used to boost T2D-decreased semen quality and metabolic disease-related male subfertility.

## The role of the gut microbiota in health and cardiovascular diseases.
 12.10.2022, _L Wang, S Wang, Q Zhang, C He, C Fu, Q Wei_


The gut microbiota is critical to human health, such as digesting nutrients, forming the intestinal epithelial barrier, regulating immune function, producing vitamins and hormones, and producing metabolites to interact with the host. Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota has a strong correlation with the occurrence, progression and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In patients with CVDs and corresponding risk factors, the composition and ratio of gut microbiota have significant differences compared with their healthy counterparts. Therefore, gut microbiota dysbiosis, gut microbiota-generated metabolites, and the related signaling pathway may serve as explanations for some of the mechanisms about the occurrence and development of CVDs. Several studies have also demonstrated that many traditional and latest therapeutic treatments of CVDs are associated with the gut microbiota and its generated metabolites and related signaling pathways. Given that information, we summarized the latest advances in the current research regarding the effect of gut microbiota on health, the main cardiovascular risk factors, and CVDs, highlighted the roles and mechanisms of several metabolites, and introduced corresponding promising treatments for CVDs regarding the gut microbiota. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on exploring the role of gut microbiota related metabolites and their therapeutic potential in CVDs, which may eventually provide better solutions in the development of therapeutic treatment as well as the prevention of CVDs.

## Airborne polystyrene microplastics and nanoplastics induce nasal and lung microbial dysbiosis in mice.
 10.10.2022, _H Zha, J Xia, S Li, J Lv, A Zhuge, R Tang, S Wang, K Wang, K Chang, L Li_


Microplastics (MP) and nanoplastics (NP) have been found in multiple environments and creatures. However, their effects on the airway microbiota still remain poorly understood. In this study, a series of bioinformatic and statistical analyses were carried out to explore the influence of airborne MP and NP on the nasal and lung microbiota in mice. Both MP and NP were capable of inducing nasal microbial dysbiosis, and MP had a stronger influence on the lung microbiota than NP. Multiple nasal and lung bacteria were associated with MP and NP groups, among which nasal Staphylococcus and lung Roseburia were most associated with MP group, while nasal Prevotella and lung unclassified_Muribaculaceae were most associated with NP group. The nasal Staphylococcus, lung Roseburia, lung Eggerthella and lung Corynebacterium were associated with both MP and NP groups, which were potential biomarkers of micro/nanoplastics-induced airway dysbiosis. SAR11_Clade_Ia and SAR11_Clade_II were associated with both nasal and lung microbiota in MP group, while no such bacterium was determined in NP group. The relevant results suggest that both airborne MP and NP could induce nasal and lung microbial dysbiosis, and the relevant preventative and curable strategies deserve further investigations.

## Effects of urban particulate matter on gut microbiome and partial schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice: Evidence from shotgun metagenomic and metabolomic profiling.
 10.10.2022, _W Yi, Y Ji, H Gao, S Luo, R Pan, J Song, Y He, Y Li, Y Wu, S Yan, Y Liang, X Sun, X Jin, L Mei, J Cheng, H Su_


Epidemiological evidence reported that particulate matter (PM) was associated with increased schizophrenia (SCZ) risk. Disturbance of gut microbiome was involved in SCZ. However, it remains unclear whether PM induces SCZ-like symptoms and how gut microbiome regulates them. Therefore, a multi-omics animal experiment was conducted to verify how urban PM induces SCZ-like behavior and altered gut microbiota and metabolic pathways.

## Lactococcus lactis' Effect on the Intestinal Microbiota of Streptococcus agalactiae-Infected Zebrafish (Danio rerio).
 10.10.2022, _C Tan, Q Li, X Yang, J Chen, Q Zhang, X Deng_


Streptococcus agalactiae is a common pathogen in aquaculture that disrupts the balance of the intestinal microbiota and threatens fish health, causing enormous losses to the aquaculture industry. In this study, we isolated and screened a Lactococcus lactis KUST48 (LLK48) strain with antibacterial effect against S. agalactiae in vitro and used it as a potential probiotic to explore its therapeutic effect on zebrafish (Danio rerio) infected with S. agalactiae. This study divided zebrafish into 3 groups: control group, injected with phosphate-buffered saline; infection group, injected with S. agalactiae; and treatment group, treated with LLK48 after S. agalactiae injection. Then, the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the intestinal microbiota of these 3 groups were sequenced using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the relative abundance of intestinal bacteria was significantly decreased in the infection group, and a high relative abundance of S. agalactiae was observed. The relative abundance of the intestinal microbiota was increased in the treatment group, with a decrease in the relative abundance of S. agalactiae compared to that in the control group. In the Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins function classification, the relative abundance of each biological function in the infection group was significantly lower than that of the control and treatment groups, showing that LLK48 has a positive therapeutic effect on zebrafish infected with S. agalactiae. This study provides a foundation for exploring the pathogenic mechanism of S. agalactiae on fish and their intestinal symbionts, and also presents a new approach for the treatment of S. agalactiae infections in fish aquaculture systems. IMPORTANCE L. lactis KUST48 (LLK48) with a bacteriostatic effect against S. agalactiae was isolated from tilapia intestinal tracts. S. agalactiae infection significantly reduced the relative abundance of intestinal bacteria and various physiological functions in zebrafish intestines. LLK48 demonstrated infection and subsequent therapeutic effects on the S. agalactiae infection in the zebrafish intestine. Therefore, the potential probiotic LLK48 can be considered as a therapeutic treatment for S. agalactiae infections in aquaculture, which can reduce the use of antibiotics and help maintain fish health.

The rumen is an ecosystem with a complex microbial microflora in which microbes initiate biofilm formation by attaching to plant surfaces for plant degradation and are capable of converting feed to nutrients and energy via microbial processes. Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell communication mechanism that allows microbes to synchronize the expression of multiple genes in the group to perform social behaviors such as chemotaxis and biofilm formation using self-synthesized QS signaling molecules. Whereas QS has been extensively studied in model microorganisms under pure culture conditions, QS mechanisms are poorly understood in complex bacterial communities, such as the rumen microflora, in which cell-to-cell communication may be common.

Healthier ruminant products can be achieved by adequate manipulation of the rumen microbiota to increase the flux of beneficial fatty acids reaching host tissues. Genomic selection to modify the microbiome function provides a permanent and accumulative solution, which may have also favourable consequences in other traits of interest (e.g. methane emissions). Possibly due to a lack of data, this strategy has never been explored.

Mammalian intestinal microbiomes are necessary for antagonizing systemic viral infections. However, very few studies have identified whether poultry commensal bacteria play a crucial role in protecting against systemic viral infections. Nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a pathogenic coronavirus that causes high morbidity and multiorgan infection tropism in chickens.

## Dissecting the cotranscriptome landscape of plants and their microbiota.
 11.10.2022, _T Nobori, Y Cao, F Entila, E Dahms, Y Tsuda, R Garrido-Oter, K Tsuda_


Interactions between plants and neighboring microbial species are fundamental elements that collectively determine the structure and function of the plant microbiota. However, the molecular basis of such interactions is poorly characterized. Here, we colonize Arabidopsis leaves with nine plant-associated bacteria from all major phyla of the plant microbiota and profile cotranscriptomes of plants and bacteria six hours after inoculation. We detect both common and distinct cotranscriptome signatures among plant-commensal pairs. In planta responses of commensals are similar to those of a disarmed pathogen characterized by the suppression of genes involved in general metabolism in contrast to a virulent pathogen. We identify genes that are enriched in the genome of plant-associated bacteria and induced in planta, which may be instrumental for bacterial adaptation to the host environment and niche separation. This study provides insights into how plants discriminate among bacterial strains and lays the foundation for in-depth mechanistic dissection of plant-microbiota interactions.

## MiMeDB: the Human Microbial Metabolome Database.
 10.10.2022, _DS Wishart, E Oler, H Peters, A Guo, S Girod, S Han, S Saha, VW Lui, M LeVatte, V Gautam, R Kaddurah-Daouk, N Karu_


The Human Microbial Metabolome Database (MiMeDB) (https://mimedb.org) is a comprehensive, multi-omic, microbiome resource that connects: (i) microbes to microbial genomes; (ii) microbial genomes to microbial metabolites; (iii) microbial metabolites to the human exposome and (iv) all of these 'omes' to human health. MiMeDB was established to consolidate the growing body of data connecting the human microbiome and the chemicals it produces to both health and disease. MiMeDB contains detailed taxonomic, microbiological and body-site location data on most known human microbes (bacteria and fungi). This microbial data is linked to extensive genomic and proteomic sequence data that is closely coupled to colourful interactive chromosomal maps. The database also houses detailed information about all the known metabolites generated by these microbes, their structural, chemical and spectral properties, the reactions and enzymes responsible for these metabolites and the primary exposome sources (food, drug, cosmetic, pollutant, etc.) that ultimately lead to the observed microbial metabolites in humans. Additional, extensively referenced data about the known or presumptive health effects, measured biosample concentrations and human protein targets for these compounds is provided. All of this information is housed in richly annotated, highly interactive, visually pleasing database that has been designed to be easy to search, easy to browse and easy to navigate. Currently MiMeDB contains data on 626 health effects or bioactivities, 1904 microbes, 3112 references, 22 054 reactions, 24 254 metabolites or exposure chemicals, 648 861 MS and NMR spectra, 6.4 million genes and 7.6 billion DNA bases. We believe that MiMeDB represents the kind of integrated, multi-omic or systems biology database that is needed to enable comprehensive multi-omic integration.

## gutMDisorder v2.0: a comprehensive database for dysbiosis of gut microbiota in phenotypes and interventions.
 10.10.2022, _C Qi, Y Cai, K Qian, X Li, J Ren, P Wang, T Fu, T Zhao, L Cheng, L Shi, X Zhang_


Gut microbiota plays a significant role in maintaining host health, and conversely, disorders potentially lead to dysbiosis, an imbalance in the composition of the gut microbial community. Intervention approaches, such as medications, diets, and several others, also alter the gut microbiota in either a beneficial or harmful direction. In 2020, the gutMDisorder was developed to facilitate researchers in the investigation of dysbiosis of gut microbes as occurs in various disorders as well as with therapeutic interventions. The database has been updated this year, following revision of previous publications and newly published reports to manually integrate confirmed associations under multitudinous conditions. Additionally, the microbial contents of downloaded gut microbial raw sequencing data were annotated, the metadata of the corresponding hosts were manually curated, and the interactive charts were developed to enhance visualization. The improvements have assembled into gutMDisorder v2.0, a more advanced search engine and an upgraded web interface, which can be freely accessed via http://bio-annotation.cn/gutMDisorder/.
