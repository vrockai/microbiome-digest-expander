## Acquisition site-based remodelling of Clostridium perfringens- and Clostridioides difficile-related gut microbiota.
 13.10.2023, _G Herrera, L Vega, A Camargo, MA Patarroyo, JD Ramírez, M Muñoz_


Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive, anaerobic sporulating bacillus which can infect several hosts, thereby being considered the causative agent of many gut illnesses. Some studies have suggested that C. perfringens's virulence factors may negatively affect gut microbiota homeostasis by decreasing beneficial bacteria; however, studies have failed to evaluate the simultaneous presence of other pathogenic bacteria, such as C. difficile (another sporulating bacillus known to play a role in gut microbiota imbalance). Conscious of the lack of compelling data, this work has ascertained how such microorganisms' coexistence can be associated with a variation in gut microbiota composition, compared to that of C. perfringens colonisation.

## Changes in Surgical Opioid Prescribing and Patient-Reported Outcomes After Implementation of an Insurer Opioid Prescribing Limit.
 13.10.2023, _KP Chua, TD Nguyen, CM Brummett, AS Bohnert, V Gunaseelan, MJ Englesbe, JF Waljee_


Insurers are increasingly limiting the duration of opioid prescriptions for acute pain. Among patients undergoing surgery, it is unclear whether implementation of these limits is associated with changes in opioid prescribing and patient-reported outcomes, such as pain.
