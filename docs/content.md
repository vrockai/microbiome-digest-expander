Transcriptional recording by CRISPR spacer acquisition from RNA endows engineered Escherichia coli with synthetic memory, which through Record-seq reveals transcriptome-scale records. Microbial sentinels that traverse the gastrointestinal tract capture a wide range of genes and pathways that describe interactions with the host, including quantitative shifts in the molecular environment that result from alterations in the host diet, induced inflammation, and microbiome complexity. We demonstrate multiplexed recording using barcoded CRISPR arrays, enabling the reconstruction of transcriptional histories of isogenic bacterial strains in vivo. Record-seq therefore provides a scalable, noninvasive platform for interrogating intestinal and microbial physiology throughout the length of the intestine without manipulations to host physiology and can determine how single microbial genetic differences alter the way in which the microbe adapts to the host intestinal environment.

Undernutrition is a public health challenge in sub-Saharan countries, including Uganda. In a previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a nutrition, hygiene and stimulation education intervention among mothers of 6 months' old children, we found less caries in the intervention group when the children were 36 months of age. We now examined the effects of (i) the intervention on the microbiota, (ii) microbiota on caries, and (iii) the intervention and microbiota on caries. The original RCT comprised 511 mother/child pairs whereas in the current study we had access to data from 344/511 (67%) children aged 36 months. The saliva microbiota was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Carious lesions (a proxy for dental health) were identified using close-up intra-oral photographs of the upper front teeth. Statistical models were used to determine host-microbiota associations. The intervention had a significant effect on the microbiota, e.g. an increase in Streptococcus abundance and decreases in Alloprevotella and Tannerella. Significant associations between the microbiota and dental caries were identified: Positive associations of Capnocytophaga and Tannerella suggest that these taxa may be deleterious to dental health while negative associations of Granulicatella, Fusobacterium, and Abiotrophia suggest taxa potentially beneficial or benign contributors to dental health. Based on taxonomic profiles, the effects of the intervention and microbiota on dental health may be independent of one another. Educational interventions with emphasis on nutrition and oral hygiene may provide a feasible strategy to decrease progression of childhood caries in low-resource settings.

## Gut microbiota: Role and Association with Tumorigenesis in Different Malignancies.
 11.05.2022, _A Ali, A Ara, MK Kashyap_


The microbiota has been associated with different cancer and may vary from patient to patient. A specific microbial strain can alter the progression of cancer and therapeutic outcome in response to anti-cancer therapy. The variations in microbiota contributed due to the individual microbiome of the microorganism are responsible for diverse clinical outcomes. The expansion of microbiota subpopulation during dysbiosis can lead to toxin production, inducing inflammation and cancer. The microbiota can be a dual-edged sword because it can be tumor-suppressive or oncogenic in the case of the gut. The transition of cancer cells from early to late-stage also impacts the composition of the microbiota, and this alteration could change the behavior of cancer. Multi-omics platforms derived data from an individual's multi-dimensional data (DNA, mRNA, microRNA, protein, metabolite, microbiota, and microbiome), i.e., individualome, to exploit it for personalized tailored treatment for different cancers in a precise manner. A number of studies suggest the importance of microbiota and its add-in suitability to existing treatment options for different malignancies. Furthermore, in vitro, and in vivo studies and cancer clinical trials suggest that probiotics have driven modulation of gut microbiota and other sites discourage the aggressive behavior and progression of different cancers.

The age-associated alterations in microbiomes vary across populations due to the influence of genetics and lifestyles. To the best of our knowledge, the microbial changes associated with aging have not yet been investigated in Singapore adults. We conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal and saliva samples, as well as fecal metabolomics to characterize the gut and oral microbial communities of 62 healthy adult male Singaporeans, including 32 young subjects (age, 23.1 ± 1.4 years) and 30 elderly subjects (age, 69.0 ± 3.5 years). We identified 8 gut and 13 oral species that were differentially abundant in elderly compared to young subjects. By combining the gut and oral microbiomes, 25 age-associated oral-gut species connections were identified. Moreover, oral bacteria Acidaminococcus intestine and Flavonifractor plautii were less prevalent/abundant in elderly gut samples than in young gut samples, whereas Collinsella aerofaciens and Roseburia hominis showed the opposite trends. These results indicate the varied gut-oral communications with aging. Subsequently, we expanded the association studies on microbiome, metabolome and host phenotypic parameters. In particular, Eubacterium eligens increased in elderly compared to young subjects, and was positively correlated with triglycerides, which implies that the potential role of E. eligens in lipid metabolism is altered during the aging process. Our results demonstrated aging-associated changes in the gut and oral microbiomes, as well as the connections between metabolites and host-microbe interactions, thereby deepening the understanding of alterations in the human microbiome during the aging process in a Singapore population.

Intestinal host-microbiota interactions during the first year of life are critical for infant development. Early-life antibiotic exposures disrupt stereotypical gut microbiota maturation and adversely affect childhood health. Furthermore, antibiotics increase the abundance of resistant bacteria and enrich the resistome-the compendium of antibiotic resistance genes-within the gut microbiota. Here, we discuss acute and persistent impacts of antibiotic exposure during infancy on pediatric health, the gut microbiome, and, particularly, the resistome. Reviewing our current understanding of antibiotic resistance acquisition and dissemination within and between microbiomes, we highlight open questions, which are imperative to resolve in the face of rising bacterial resistance.

## The developing infant gut microbiome: A strain-level view.
 18.05.2022, _H Enav, F Bäckhed, RE Ley_


_Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Microbiota_
At birth, neonates provide a vast habitat awaiting microbial colonization. Microbiome assembly is a complex process involving microbial seeding and succession driven by ecological forces and subject to environmental conditions. These successional events not only significantly affect the ecology and function of the microbiome, but also impact host health. While the establishment of the infant microbiome has been a point of interest for decades, an integrated view focusing on strain level colonization has been lacking until recently. Technological and computational advancements enabling strain-level analyses of the infant microbiome have demonstrated the immense complexity of this system and allowed for an improved understanding of how strains of the same species spread, colonize, evolve, and affect the host. Here, we review the current knowledge of the establishment and maturation of the infant gut microbiome with particular emphasis on newer discoveries achieved through strain-centric analyses.

Probiotics are increasingly administered to premature infants to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis and neonatal sepsis. However, their effects on gut microbiome assembly and immunity are poorly understood. Using a randomized intervention trial in extremely premature infants, we tested the effects of a probiotic product containing four strains of Bifidobacterium species autochthonous to the infant gut and one Lacticaseibacillus strain on the compositional and functional trajectory of microbiome. Daily administration of the mixture accelerated the transition into a mature, term-like microbiome with higher stability and species interconnectivity. Besides infant age, Bifidobacterium strains and stool metabolites were the best predictors of microbiome maturation, and structural equation modeling confirmed probiotics as a major determinant for the trajectory of microbiome assembly. Bifidobacterium-driven microbiome maturation was also linked to an anti-inflammatory intestinal immune milieu. This demonstrates that Bifidobacterium strains are ecosystem engineers that lead to an acceleration of microbiome maturation and immunological consequences in extremely premature infants.

## Effective Regulation of Gut Microbiota With Probiotics and Prebiotics May Prevent or Alleviate COVID-19 Through the Gut-Lung Axis.
 16.05.2022, _L Xu, CS Yang, Y Liu, X Zhang_


Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can disrupt the gut microbiota balance, and patients usually have intestinal disorders. The intestine is the largest immune organ of the human body, and gut microbes can affect the immune function of the lungs through the gut-lung axis. Many lines of evidence support the role of beneficial bacteria in enhancing human immunity, preventing pathogen colonization, and thereby reducing the incidence and severity of infection. In this article, we review the possible approach of modulating microbiota to help prevent and treat respiratory tract infections, including COVID-19, and discuss the possibility of using probiotics and prebiotics for this purpose. We also discuss the mechanism by which intestinal micro-flora regulate immunity and the effects of probiotics on the intestinal micro-ecological balance. Based on this understanding, we propose the use of probiotics and prebiotics to modulate gut microbiota for the prevention or alleviation of COVID-19 through the gut-lung axis.

## A Reciprocal Link Between Gut Microbiota, Inflammation and Depression: A Place for Probiotics?
 16.05.2022, _A Eltokhi, IE Sommer_


Depression is a severe mental disorder that places a significant economic burden on public health. The reciprocal link between the trillions of bacteria in the gut, the microbiota, and depression is a controversial topic in neuroscience research and has drawn the attention of public interest and press coverage in recent years. Mounting pieces of evidence shed light on the role of the gut microbiota in depression, which is suggested to involve immune, endocrine, and neural pathways that are the main components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota play major roles in brain development and physiology and ultimately behavior. The bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and brain function has been extensively explored in animal models of depression and clinical research in humans. Certain gut microbiota strains have been associated with the pathophysiology of depression. Therefore, oral intake of probiotics, the beneficial living bacteria and yeast, may represent a therapeutic approach for depression treatment. In this review, we summarize the findings describing the possible links between the gut microbiota and depression, focusing mainly on the inflammatory markers and sex hormones. By discussing preclinical and clinical studies on probiotics as a supplementary therapy for depression, we suggest that probiotics may be beneficial in alleviating depressive symptoms, possibly through immune modulation. Still, further comprehensive studies are required to draw a more solid conclusion regarding the efficacy of probiotics and their mechanisms of action.

The gut microbiome of humans and animals is critical to host health. Mice are used to investigate the microbiome and its influences; however, the predictive value of such studies is hindered by cage effects due to coprophagy. Our objectives were to evaluate the influence of cage density on the statistical power to detect treatment-dependent effects of a selective pressure on microbiome composition. C57BL/6 mice were separated into groups of 2 or 4 mice per cage and then assigned to groups receiving enrofloxacin, broad-spectrum antibiotics, or control. Fecal samples were collected at weeks 0, 1, and 4, along with contents of the jejunum and cecum. Bacterial DNA analysis examined microbiome richness, diversity, and variability within and between cages. Statistical analyses reveal that reduced housing density consistently results in comparable susceptibility to antibiotics, reduced cage effects, and increased statistical power to detect treatment-associated effects, justifying the practice of reduced housing density.

## Variational Approximation-Based Model Selection for Microbial Network Inference.
 17.05.2022, _S Yooseph, S Tavakoli_


Microbial associations are characterized by both direct and indirect interactions between the constituent taxa in a microbial community, and play an important role in determining the structure, organization, and function of the community. Microbial associations can be represented using a weighted graph (microbial network), whose nodes represent taxa and edges represent pairwise associations. A microbial network is typically inferred from a sample-taxa matrix that is obtained by sequencing multiple biological samples and identifying the taxa counts in each sample. However, it is known that microbial associations are impacted by environmental and/or host factors. Thus, a sample-taxa matrix generated in a microbiome study involving a wide range of values for the environmental and/or clinical metadata variables may in fact be associated with more than one microbial network. In this study, we consider the problem of inferring multiple microbial networks from a given sample-taxa count matrix. Each sample is a count vector assumed to be generated by a mixture model consisting of component distributions that are multivariate Poisson log-normal. We present a variational expectation maximization algorithm for the model selection problem to infer the correct number of components of this mixture model. Our approach involves reframing the mixture model as a latent variable model, treating only the mixing coefficients as parameters, and subsequently approximating the marginal likelihood using an evidence lower bound framework. Our algorithm is evaluated on a large simulated dataset generated using a collection of different graph structures (band, hub, cluster, random, and scale-free).

## Opportunities and challenges of using metagenomic data to bring uncultured microbes into cultivation.
 17.05.2022, _S Liu, CD Moon, N Zheng, S Huws, S Zhao, J Wang_


_Bacteria, Genomics, Metagenome, Metagenomics, Microbiota_
Although there is now an extensive understanding of the diversity of microbial life on earth through culture-independent metagenomic DNA sequence analyses, the isolation and cultivation of microbes remains critical to directly study them and confirm their metabolic and physiological functions, and their ecological roles. The majority of environmental microbes are as yet uncultured however; therefore, bringing these rare or poorly characterized groups into culture is a priority to further understand microbiome functions. Moreover, cultivated isolates may find utility in a range of applications, such as new probiotics, biocontrol agents, and agents for industrial processes. The growing abundance of metagenomic and meta-transcriptomic sequence information from a wide range of environments provides more opportunities to guide the isolation and cultivation of microbes of interest. In this paper, we discuss a range of successful methodologies and applications that have underpinned recent metagenome-guided isolation and cultivation of microbe efforts. These approaches include determining specific culture conditions to enrich for taxa of interest, to more complex strategies that specifically target the capture of microbial species through antibody engineering and genome editing strategies. With the greater degree of genomic information now available from uncultivated members, such as via metagenome-assembled genomes, the theoretical understanding of their cultivation requirements will enable greater possibilities to capture these and ultimately gain a more comprehensive understanding of the microbiomes.
