Gut metaproteomics can provide direct evidence of microbial functions actively expressed in the colonic environments, contributing to clarify the role of the gut microbiota in human physiology. In this study, we re-analyzed 10 fecal metaproteomics datasets of healthy individuals from different continents and countries, with the aim of identifying stable and variable gut microbial functions and defining the contribution of specific bacterial taxa to the main metabolic pathways. The "core" metaproteome included 182 microbial functions and 83 pathways that were identified in all individuals analyzed. Several enzymes involved in glucose and pyruvate metabolism, along with glutamate dehydrogenase, acetate kinase, elongation factors G and Tu and DnaK, were the proteins with the lowest abundance variability in the cohorts under study. On the contrary, proteins involved in chemotaxis, response to stress and cell adhesion were among the most variable functions. Random-effect meta-analysis of correlation trends between taxa, functions and pathways revealed key ecological and molecular associations within the gut microbiota. The contribution of specific bacterial taxa to the main biological processes was also investigated, finding that Faecalibacterium is the most stable genus and the top contributor to anti-inflammatory butyrate production in the healthy gut microbiota. Active production of other mucosal immunomodulators facilitating host tolerance was observed, including Roseburia flagellin and lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic enzymes expressed by members of Bacteroidota. Our study provides a detailed picture of the healthy human gut microbiota, contributing to unveil its functional mechanisms and its relationship with nutrition, immunity, and environmental stressors.

Population stratification based on interindividual variability in gut microbiota composition has revealed the existence of several ecotypes named enterotypes in humans and various animal species. Enterotypes are often associated with environmental factors including diet, but knowledge of the role of host genetics remains scarce. Moreover, enterotypes harbor functionalities likely associated with varying abilities and susceptibilities of their host. Previously, we showed that under controlled conditions, 60-day-old pig populations consistently split into two enterotypes with either Prevotella and Mitsuokella (PM enterotype) or Ruminococcus and Treponema (RT enterotype) as keystone taxa. Here, our aim was to rely on pig as a model to study the influence of host genetics to assemble enterotypes, and to provide clues on enterotype functional differences and their links with growth traits.

Neutrophils are increasingly implicated in chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders. Here, we show that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from individuals with obesity contains more neutrophils than in those without obesity and is associated with a distinct bacterial community. Exploring the mechanism, we gavaged microbiome-depleted mice with stool from patients with and without obesity during high-fat or normal diet administration. Only mice receiving high-fat diet and stool from subjects with obesity show enrichment of VAT neutrophils, suggesting donor microbiome and recipient diet determine VAT neutrophilia. A rise in pro-inflammatory CD4+ Th1 cells and a drop in immunoregulatory T cells in VAT only follows if there is a transient spike in neutrophils. Human VAT neutrophils exhibit a distinct gene expression pattern that is found in different human tissues, including tumors. VAT neutrophils and bacteria may be a novel therapeutic target for treating inflammatory-driven complications of obesity, including insulin resistance and colon cancer.

## Role of the intestinal microbiota in contributing to weight disorders and associated comorbidities.
 28.06.2024, _M Van Hul, AM Neyrinck, A Everard, A Abot, LB Bindels, NM Delzenne, C Knauf, PD Cani_


SUMMARYThe gut microbiota is a major factor contributing to the regulation of energy homeostasis and has been linked to both excessive body weight and accumulation of fat mass (i.e., overweight, obesity) or body weight loss, weakness, muscle atrophy, and fat depletion (i.e., cachexia). These syndromes are characterized by multiple metabolic dysfunctions including abnormal regulation of food reward and intake, energy storage, and low-grade inflammation. Given the increasing worldwide prevalence of obesity, cachexia, and associated metabolic disorders, novel therapeutic strategies are needed. Among the different mechanisms explaining how the gut microbiota is capable of influencing host metabolism and energy balance, numerous studies have investigated the complex interactions existing between nutrition, gut microbes, and their metabolites. In this review, we discuss how gut microbes and different microbiota-derived metabolites regulate host metabolism. We describe the role of the gut barrier function in the onset of inflammation in this context. We explore the importance of the gut-to-brain axis in the regulation of energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism but also the key role played by the liver. Finally, we present specific key examples of how using targeted approaches such as prebiotics and probiotics might affect specific metabolites, their signaling pathways, and their interactions with the host and reflect on the challenges to move from bench to bedside.

The bidirectional relationship between cerebral structures and the gastrointestinal tract involving the microbiota embraces the scientific concept of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The gut microbiome plays an important role in many physiological and biochemical processes of the human body, in the immune response and maintenance of homeostasis, as well as in the regulation of circadian rhythms. There is a relationship between the higher prevalence of a number of neurological disorders, sleep disorders and changes in the intestinal microbiota, which actualizes the study of the complex mechanisms of such correlation for the development of new treatment and prevention strategies. Environmental factors associated with excessive light exposure can aggravate the gut dysbiosis of intestinal microflora, and as a result, lead to sleep disturbances. This review examines the integrative mechanisms of sleep regulation associated with the gut microbiota (the role of neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids, unconjugated bile acids, bacterial cell wall components, cytokines). Taking into account the influence of gut dysbiosis as a risk factor in the development of various diseases, the authors systematize key aspects and modern scientific data on the importance of microflora balance to ensure optimal interaction along the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the context of the regulatory role of the sleep-wake cycle and its disorders.

## Multi-omics signatures reveal genomic and functional heterogeneity of Cutibacterium acnes in normal and diseased skin.
 28.06.2024, _T Yu, X Xu, Y Liu, X Wang, S Wu, Z Qiu, X Liu, X Pan, C Gu, S Wang, L Dong, W Li, X Yao_


Cutibacterium acnes is the most abundant bacterium of the human skin microbiome since adolescence, participating in both skin homeostasis and diseases. Here, we demonstrate individual and niche heterogeneity of C. acnes from 1,234 isolate genomes. Skin disease (atopic dermatitis and acne) and body site shape genomic differences of C. acnes, stemming from horizontal gene transfer and selection pressure. C. acnes harbors characteristic metabolic functions, fewer antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors, and a more stable genome compared with Staphylococcus epidermidis. Integrated genome, transcriptome, and metabolome analysis at the strain level unveils the functional characteristics of C. acnes. Consistent with the transcriptome signature, C. acnes in a sebum-rich environment induces toxic and pro-inflammatory effects on keratinocytes. L-carnosine, an anti-oxidative stress metabolite, is up-regulated in the C. acnes metabolome from atopic dermatitis and attenuates skin inflammation. Collectively, our study reveals the joint impact of genes and the microenvironment on C. acnes function.

Cervicitis is associated with important reproductive sequelae. Primary causes include chlamydia and gonorrhoea, but a known sexually transmitted infection (STI) is not identified in &gt;50% of cases (i.e. STI-negative cervicitis). Bacterial vaginosis (BV) and specific BV-associated bacteria have also been associated with cervicitis, but data are limited. We investigated the association between STI-negative cervicitis and vaginal microbiota composition.

## Benchmarking low- and high-throughput protein cleanup and digestion methods for human fecal metaproteomics.
 27.06.2024, _A Tanca, MA Deledda, L De Diego, M Abbondio, S Uzzau_


The application of fecal metaproteomics to large-scale studies of the gut microbiota requires high-throughput analysis and standardized experimental protocols. Although high-throughput protein cleanup and digestion methods are increasingly used in shotgun proteomics, no studies have yet critically compared such protocols using human fecal samples. In this study, human fecal protein extracts were processed using several different protocols based on three main approaches: filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3), and suspension trapping (S-Trap). These protocols were applied in both low-throughput (i.e., microtube-based) and high-throughput (i.e., microplate-based) formats, and the final peptide mixtures were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. The FASP-based methods and the combination of SP3 with in-StageTips (iST) yielded the best results in terms of the number of peptides identified through a database search against gut microbiome and human sequences. The efficiency of protein digestion, the ability to preserve hydrophobic peptides and high molecular weight proteins, and the reproducibility of the methods were also evaluated for the different protocols. Other relevant variables, including interindividual variability of stool, duration of protocols, and total costs, were considered and discussed. In conclusion, the data presented here can significantly contribute to the optimization and standardization of sample preparation protocols in human fecal metaproteomics. Furthermore, the promising results obtained with the high-throughput methods are expected to encourage the development of automated workflows and their application to large-scale gut microbiome studies.IMPORTANCEFecal metaproteomics is an experimental approach that allows the investigation of gut microbial functions, which are involved in many different physiological and pathological processes. Standardization and automation of sample preparation protocols in fecal metaproteomics are essential for its application in large-scale studies. Here, we comparatively evaluated different methods, available also in a high-throughput format, enabling two key steps of the metaproteomics analytical workflow (namely, protein cleanup and digestion). The results of our study provide critical information that may be useful for the optimization of metaproteomics experimental pipelines and their implementation in laboratory automation systems.
