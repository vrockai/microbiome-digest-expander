Phages are highly abundant in the human gut, yet most of them remain uncultured. Here, we present a gut phage isolate collection (GPIC) containing 209 phages for 42 commensal human gut bacterial species. Genome analysis of the phages identified 34 undescribed genera. We discovered 22 phages from the Salasmaviridae family that have small genomes (∼10-20 kbp) and infect Gram-positive bacteria. Two phages from a candidate family, Paboviridae, with high prevalence in the human gut were also identified. Infection assays showed that Bacteroides and Parabacteroides phages are specific to a bacterial species, and strains of the same species also exhibit substantial variations in phage susceptibility. A cocktail of 8 phages with a broad host range for Bacteroides fragilis strains effectively reduced their abundance in complex host-derived communities in vitro. Our study expands the diversity of cultured human gut bacterial phages and provides a valuable resource for human microbiome engineering.

## Aerobic exercise training-induced alteration of gut microbiota composition affects endurance capacity.
 14.04.2023, _M Uchida, S Fujie, H Yano, M Iemitsu_


This study aimed to clarify whether aerobic exercise training-induced alterations in the gut microbiota affect physiological adaptation with endurance exercise capacity. Study 1: ICR mice were randomly divided into three groups: vehicle intake + sedentary (V+S), vehicle intake + exercise training (V+Ex), and antibiotic intake + exercise training (AB+Ex). In the exercise training groups, treadmill running was performed for eight weeks. During the exercise training intervention, the antibiotic-intake group freely drank water containing antibiotics. Study 2: ICR mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, transplantation of cecum microbiota from sedentary mice (Sed-CMT), and exercise training mice (Ex-CMT). In study 1, the treadmill running time to exhaustion, an index of maximal aerobic capacity, after aerobic exercise training in the V+Ex group was significantly longer than that in the V+S and AB+Ex groups. Gastrocnemius muscle citrate synthase (CS) activity and PGC-1α protein levels in the V+Ex group were significantly higher compared to the V+S and AB+Ex groups. The Erysipelotrichaceae and Alcaligenaceae families were positively correlated with treadmill running time to exhaustion. In study 2, the treadmill running time to exhaustion after transplantation was significantly higher in the Ex-CMT group than in the Sham and Sed-CMT groups. Furthermore, CS activity and PGC-1α protein levels in the gastrocnemius muscle were significantly higher in the Ex-CMT group than in the Sham and Sed-CMT groups. Thus, gut microbiota altered by aerobic exercise training may be involved in the augmentation of endurance capacity and muscle mitochondrial energy metabolism. KEY POINTS: Aerobic exercise training changes gut microbiota composition, and the Erysipelotrichaceae and Alcaligenaceae families were found among the altered gut bacteria. Gut microbiota was associated with endurance performance and metabolic regulator levels in skeletal muscle after aerobic exercise training. Continuous antibiotic treatment attenuated the increase in endurance performance, citrate synthase activity, and PGC-1α levels in skeletal muscle induced by aerobic exercise training. Gut microbiota transplantation from exercise-trained mice improved endurance performance and metabolic regulator levels in recipient skeletal muscle, despite the absence of aerobic exercise training. Abstract figure legend Study 1: In mice with or without the antibiotic treatment, aerobic treadmill running was performed for 8 weeks. In the trained mice with vehicle treatment, aerobic exercise training changed gut microbiota composition and induced augmentation of running time, muscle citrate synthase (CS) activity, and PGC-1α levels, but continuous antibiotic treatment attenuated the training effects. Study 2: Mice were transplanted with cecum microbiota of exercise-trained mice. The transplanted mice showed augmentation of running time, muscle CS activity, and PGC-1α levels. These findings suggest that gut microbiota altered by aerobic exercise training may be involved in the augmentation of endurance capacity and muscle mitochondrial energy metabolism.

## Dental caries and their microbiomes in children: what do we do now?
 15.04.2023, _AA Ribeiro, BJ Paster_


The oral cavity is an unique ecosystem formed by different structures, tissues, and a complex microbial community formed by hundreds of different species of bacteria, fungi, viruses, phages, and the candidate phyla radiation (CPR) group, all living in symbiosis with healthy individuals. In an opposite state, dental caries is a biofilm-mediated dysbiosis that involves changes in the core microbiome composition and function, which leads to the demineralization of tooth tissues due to the fermentation of dietary carbohydrates, producing acid by select oral bacteria. The cariogenic biofilm is typically characterized by bacterial species with the ability of adhering to the saliva-coated tooth surface, production of exopolysaccharides-rich matrix (which will limit the diffusion of acidic products of carbohydrate fermentation), and the ability of surviving in this acidic environment. Besides years of research and dental treatment, dental caries remains the most common chronic disease in children worldwide. This article aims to bring an insightful discussion about important questions that remain unanswered in the Cariology and Oral Microbiology fields, to move Science forward, characterize the interrelationships of these communities, and understand mechanistic functions between microorganisms and the host, therefore leading to translatable knowledge that benefits the provision of care to our pediatric patients.

## Role of the Microbiome in Gut-Heart-Kidney Cross Talk.

_Humans, Uremic Toxins, Dysbiosis, Quality of Life, Kidney, Renal Insufficiency, Chronic, Microbiota_
Homeostasis is a prerequisite for health. When homeostasis becomes disrupted, dysfunction occurs. This is especially the case for the gut microbiota, which under normal conditions lives in symbiosis with the host. As there are as many microbial cells in and on our body as human cells, it is unlikely they would not contribute to health or disease. The gut bacterial metabolism generates numerous beneficial metabolites but also uremic toxins and their precursors, which are transported into the circulation. Barrier function in the intestine, the heart, and the kidneys regulates metabolite transport and concentration and plays a role in inter-organ and inter-organism communication via small molecules. This communication is analyzed from the perspective of the remote sensing and signaling theory, which emphasizes the role of a large network of multispecific, oligospecific, and monospecific transporters and enzymes in regulating small-molecule homeostasis. The theory provides a systems biology framework for understanding organ cross talk and microbe-host communication involving metabolites, signaling molecules, nutrients, antioxidants, and uremic toxins. This remote small-molecule communication is critical for maintenance of homeostasis along the gut-heart-kidney axis and for responding to homeostatic perturbations. Chronic kidney disease is characterized by gut dysbiosis and accumulation of toxic metabolites. This slowly impacts the body, affecting the cardiovascular system and contributing to the progression of kidney dysfunction, which in its turn influences the gut microbiota. Preserving gut homeostasis and barrier functions or restoring gut dysbiosis and dysfunction could be a minimally invasive way to improve patient outcomes and quality of life in many diseases, including cardiovascular and kidney disease.

## Influence of Microbiota on Vaccine Effectiveness: "Is the Microbiota the Key to Vaccine-induced Responses?".
 15.04.2023, _SH Hong_


Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools for preventing infectious diseases. To effectively fight pathogens, vaccines should induce potent and long-lasting immune responses that are specific to the pathogens. However, not all vaccines can induce effective immune responses, and the responses vary greatly among individuals and populations. Although several factors, such as age, host genetics, nutritional status, and region, affect the effectiveness of vaccines, increasing data have suggested that the gut microbiota is critically associated with vaccine-induced immune responses. In this review, I discuss how gut microbiota affects vaccine effectiveness based on the clinical and preclinical data, and summarize possible underlying mechanisms related to the adjuvant effects of microbiota. A better understanding of the link between vaccine-induced immune responses and the gut microbiota using high-throughput technology and sophisticated system vaccinology approaches could provide crucial insights for designing effective personalized preventive and therapeutic vaccination strategies.

## Deciphering the quorum-sensing lexicon of the gut microbiota.
 17.04.2023, _RA Oliveira, V Cabral, I Torcato, KB Xavier_


_Animals, Quorum Sensing, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Lactones, Bacteria, Homoserine, Mammals_
The enduring coexistence between the gut microbiota and the host has led to a symbiotic relationship that benefits both parties. In this complex, multispecies environment, bacteria can communicate through chemical molecules to sense and respond to the chemical, physical, and ecological properties of the surrounding environment. One of the best-studied cell-to-cell communication mechanisms is quorum sensing. Chemical signaling through quorum sensing is involved in regulating the bacterial group behaviors, often required for host colonization. However, most microbial-host interactions regulated by quorum sensing are studied in pathogens. Here, we will focus on the latest reports on the emerging studies of quorum sensing in the gut microbiota symbionts and on group behaviors adopted by these bacteria to colonize the mammalian gut. Moreover, we address the challenges and approaches to uncover molecule-mediated communication mechanisms, which will allow us to unravel the processes that drive the establishment of gut microbiota.

_Metabolome, Proteomics, Microbiota, Feces, Metabolomics, Bacteria_
Increasing experimental evidence suggests that administering live commensal bacterial species can optimize microbiome composition and lead to reduced disease severity and enhanced health. Our understanding of the intestinal microbiome and its functions has increased over the past two decades largely due to deep sequence analyses of fecal nucleic acids, metabolomic and proteomic assays to measure nutrient use and metabolite production, and extensive studies on the metabolism and ecological interactions of a wide range of commensal bacterial species inhabiting the intestine. Herein, we review new and important findings that have emerged from this work and provide thoughts and considerations on approaches to re-establish and optimize microbiome functions by assembling and administering commensal bacterial consortia.

## One population, multiple lifestyles: Commensalism and pathogenesis in the human mycobiome.
 17.04.2023, _DM Proctor, RA Drummond, MS Lionakis, JA Segre_


_Humans, Mycobiome, Symbiosis, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Candida albicans, Candidiasis, Invasive_
Candida auris and Candida albicans can result in invasive fungal diseases. And yet, these species can stably and asymptomatically colonize human skin and gastrointestinal tracts. To consider these disparate microbial lifestyles, we first review factors shown to influence the underlying microbiome. Structured by the damage response framework, we then consider the molecular mechanisms deployed by C. albicans to switch between commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. Next, we explore this framework with C. auris to highlight how host physiology, immunity, and/or antibiotic receipt are associated with progression from colonization to infection. While treatment with antibiotics increases the risk that an individual will succumb to invasive candidiasis, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we describe several hypotheses that may explain this phenomenon. We conclude by highlighting future directions integrating genomics with immunology to advance our understanding of invasive candidiasis and human fungal disease.

## Cross-feeding in the gut microbiome: Ecology and mechanisms.
 17.04.2023, _EJ Culp, AL Goodman_


_Animals, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Microbiota, Symbiosis, Biological Evolution, Host Microbial Interactions, Mammals_
Microbial communities are shaped by positive and negative interactions ranging from competition to mutualism. In the context of the mammalian gut and its microbial inhabitants, the integrated output of the community has important impacts on host health. Cross-feeding, the sharing of metabolites between different microbes, has emergent roles in establishing communities of gut commensals that are stable, resistant to invasion, and resilient to external perturbation. In this review, we first explore the ecological and evolutionary implications of cross-feeding as a cooperative interaction. We then survey mechanisms of cross-feeding across trophic levels, from primary fermenters to H2 consumers that scavenge the final metabolic outputs of the trophic network. We extend this analysis to also include amino acid, vitamin, and cofactor cross-feeding. Throughout, we highlight evidence for the impact of these interactions on each species' fitness as well as host health. Understanding cross-feeding illuminates an important aspect of microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions that establishes and shapes our gut communities.

## Networking between helminths, microbes, and mammals.

_Animals, Humans, Helminths, Helminthiasis, Microbiota, Immune Tolerance, Host-Parasite Interactions, Mammals_
Just as mammals have coevolved with the intestinal bacterial communities that are part of the microbiota, intestinal helminths represent an important selective force on their mammalian host. The complex interaction between helminths, microbes, and their mammalian host is likely an important determinant of mutual fitness. The host immune system in particular is a critical interface with both helminths and the microbiota, and this crosstalk often determines the balance between tolerance and resistance against these widespread parasites. Hence, there are many examples of how both helminths and the microbiota can influence tissue homeostasis and homeostatic immunity. Understanding these processes at a cellular and molecular level is an exciting area of research that we seek to highlight in this review and that will potentially guide future treatment approaches.
