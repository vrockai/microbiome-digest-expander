## The dialogue between unconventional T cells and the microbiota.

The mammalian immune system is equipped with unconventional T cells that respond to microbial molecules such as glycolipids and small-molecule metabolites, which are invisible to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells. Unconventional T cells include invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, which are involved in a wide range of infectious and non-infectious diseases, such as cancer and autoimmunity. In addition, their high conservation across mammals, their restriction by non-polymorphic antigen-presenting molecules, and their immediate and robust responses make these 'innate' T cells appealing targets for the development of one-size-fits-all immunotherapies. In this review, we discuss how iNKT and MAIT cells directly and indirectly detect the presence of and respond to pathogenic and commensal microbes. We also explore the current understanding of the bidirectional relationship between the microbiota and innate T cells, and how this crosstalk shapes the immune response in disease.

## Stability of Skin Microbiome at Sacral Regions of Healthy Young Adults, Ambulatory Older Adults, and Bedridden Older Patients After 2 Years.

The sacral skin of bedridden older patients often develops a dysbiotic condition. To clarify whether the condition changes or is sustained over time, we analyzed the skin microbiome and the skin physiological functions of the sacral skin in patients who completed our 2017 study.
