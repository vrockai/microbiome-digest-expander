The skin microbiome is essential for skin function, yet the mechanisms responsible are only beginning to be uncovered. In this issue of Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Zheng et al. demonstrate that a Staphylococcus epidermidis sphingomyelinase has a mutually beneficial role in supporting the skin barrier and promoting S. epidermidis colonization.

## Multi-omics strategies for investigating the microbiome in toxicology research.
 14.03.2022, _EW Morgan, GH Perdew, AD Patterson_


Microbial communities on and within the host contact environmental pollutants, toxic compounds, and other xenobiotic compounds. These communities of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea possess diverse metabolic potential to catabolize compounds and produce new metabolites. Microbes alter chemical disposition thus making the microbiome a natural subject of interest for toxicology. Sequencing and metabolomics technologies permits study of microbiomes altered by acute or long-term exposure to xenobiotics. These investigations have already contributed to and are helping to re-interpret traditional understandings of toxicology. The purpose of this review is to provide a survey of the current methods used to characterize microbes within the context of toxicology. This will include discussion of commonly used techniques for conducting omic-based experiments, their respective strengths and deficiencies, and how forward-looking techniques may address present shortcomings. Finally, a perspective will be provided regarding common assumptions that currently impede microbiome studies from producing causal explanations of toxicologic mechanisms.

## Vaginal microbiome and cervical cancer.
 16.03.2022, _M Kyrgiou, AB Moscicki_


The female reproductive tract, similar to other mucosal sites, harbors a specific microbiome commonly dominated by Lactobacillus species (spp.), which has an essential role in maintaining health and homeostasis. Increasing evidence shows that genital tract dysbiosis and/or specific bacteria and cytokines might have an active role in the development and/or progression of HPV infection and cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and as a result cervical cancer. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reported that Lactobacillus spp. depletion increases with severity of CIN and that this may negatively affect disease regression rates. It is plausible that Lactobacillus deplete microbiome composition may lead to a pro-inflammatory environment that can increase malignant cell proliferation and HPV E6 and E7 oncogene expression. Future longitudinal cohorts and mechanistic experiments on HPV transfected cells models will further permit exploration of the impact of Lactobacillus spp. on HPV infection.

The pathogenesis of celiac disease (CD) is significantly influenced by gut microbiota. Daily nutritional profile influences the diversity of gut microbiota. This study was aimed to compare the abundance of gut microbiota in CD patients compared to normal control (NC), and to investigate the impact of nutritional factors on their fecal microbiota diversity. In this study, a selected panel of intestinal bacteria was assessed in 31 confirmed CD patients adhering to gluten-free diet (GFD) for more than 6 months and in 20 NC subjects. Stool samples were collected from each participant, DNA was extracted, and absolute quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out. The gut microbiota including Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteiaceae, Firmicutes, and Lactobacillus were assessed. The quantities of fruits, vegetables, meat, liquids, sugar and gluten-free candy/bread consumption were evaluated using a questionnaire. The proportion of Bifidobacterium, Firmicutes, and Lactobacillus in CD cases was significantly lower than NC (P &lt; 0.005). Significant correlation coefficients between Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (P &lt; 0.001), and also Firmicutes and Lactobacillus (P &lt; 0.001) were recorded. Moreover, a significant association between medium amount of meat and bean consumptions and low abundance of Lactobacillus and Firmicutes (P = 0.024 and P = 0.027, respectively), and also high amount of bean consumptions and low abundance of Lactobacillus (P = 0.027) in CD were observed. The results showed that meat and bean consumptions could reduce the beneficial bacteria including Firmicutes and Lactobacillus in CD patients. Therefore, changes in the gut microbiota abundance may contribute to dietary changes and unimproved CD symptoms.

## The effects of the Green-Mediterranean diet on cardiometabolic health are linked to gut microbiome modifications: a randomized controlled trial.

Previous studies have linked the Mediterranean diet (MED) with improved cardiometabolic health, showing preliminary evidence for a mediating role of the gut microbiome. We recently suggested the Green-Mediterranean (Green-MED) diet as an improved version of the healthy MED diet, with increased consumption of plant-based foods and reduced meat intake. Here, we investigated the effects of MED interventions on the gut microbiota and cardiometabolic markers, and the interplay between the two, during the initial weight loss phase of the DIRECT-PLUS trial.

## Analysis of the gut microbiota composition of myostatin mutant cattle prepared using CRISPR/Cas9.
 07.03.2022, _T Wen, C Mao, L Gao_


Myostatin (MSTN) negatively regulates muscle development and positively regulates metabolism through various pathways. Although MSTN function in cattle has been widely studied, the changes in the gut microbiota due to MSTN mutation, which contribute to host health by regulating its metabolism, remain unclear. Here, high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was conducted to analyze the gut microbiota of wild-type (WT) and MSTN mutant (MT) cattle. A total of 925 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained, which were classified into 11 phyla and 168 genera. Alpha diversity results showed no significant differences between MT and WT cattle. Beta diversity analyses suggested that the microbial composition of WT and MT cattle was different. Three dominant phyla and 21 dominant genera were identified. The most abundant bacterial genus had a significant relationship with the host metabolism. Moreover, various bacteria beneficial for health were found in the intestines of MT cattle. Analysis of the correlation between dominant gut bacteria and serum metabolic factors affected by MSTN mutation indicated that MSTN mutation affected the metabolism mainly by three metabolism-related bacteria, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010. This study provides further insight into MSTN mutation regulating the host metabolism by gut microbes and provides evidence for the safety of gene-edited animals.

## Gut microbiome modifications over time when removing in-feed antibiotics from the prophylaxis of post-weaning diarrhea in piglets.
 10.03.2022, _P Cremonesi, F Biscarini, B Castiglioni, CA Sgoifo, R Compiani, P Moroni_


Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in pigs has mainly an infectious basis and control strategies are centred on antibiotics added to the diet. Given concerns on the spread of multi-resistant bacteria, it is necessary to develop alternative prophylactic approaches to control PWD in piglets. The most promising alternative strategies are based on substances that act indirectly on the bacteria by stimulating the immune system or by improving gut health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on the gut microbiota of feed supplemented with a mixture of essential oils (garlic and oregano) in weaning piglets, compared to traditional PWD management (in-feed antibiotics) and to a control group without any diet supplementation. The study involved 197 piglets from 18 litters in a single farm. The piglets were followed from birth to day 58 of age and were weaned at day 26. During the experimental period, the animals were monitored for weight and growth, average daily gain, morbidity and mortality. For the metataxonomics analysis, rectal samples were collected from 17 piglets from the three experimental groups at 4 different time-points (days 1, 12, 26 and 58). Results revealed that the gut microbiota in pre- and post-weaning piglets was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes (51%), Bacteroidetes (25%) and Proteobacteria (16%), which together make up for over 90% of the entire piglet core gut microbiota. The core microbiota comprised 10 taxa before weaning and 43 taxa after weaning, with 7 taxa overlapping between timepoints: two of them (Prevotella 9, p-value = 0.00095; Solobacterium p-value = 0.00821) were significantly more abundant after weaning. All alpha diversity indexes were significantly different between pre- and post-weaning, while only Shannon and Simpson diversity and equitability were significantly different between treatments. Based on the matrix of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, samples showed clear clustering per timepoint (before and after weaning, p-value &lt; 0.001) and between treatments by timepoint (p-value = 0.0086). The oil-diet group showed a consistently higher F:B ratio at all timepoints. These results show that the pig gut microbiota changes significantly with weaning, and suggest that the use of essential oils as feed supplementation to control PWD does not seem to alter sgnificantly the microbiota nor the growth parameters of piglets, however modifications of specific taxa may occur.
