Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is the most common oral cavity cancer, and p16 immunohistochemistry is an exact and available tool in the prognostic and predictive characterization of squamous cell cancers in the head and neck. Microorganisms have a close relationship with the development of TSCC. However, the association between oral bacteria and p16 status has not been well defined in the case of TSCC. Compared with traditional clinical microbial collection methods, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples have several advantages.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) involves systemic changes in peripheral blood and gut microbiota, but the current understanding is incomplete. Herein, we conducted a multi-omics analysis of fecal and blood samples obtained from an observational cohort including MDD patients (n = 99) and healthy control (HC, n = 50). 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota showed structural alterations in MDD, as characterized by increased Enterococcus. Metagenomics sequencing of gut microbiota showed substantial functional alterations including upregulation in the superpathway of the glyoxylate cycle and fatty acid degradation and downregulation in various metabolic pathways in MDD. Plasma metabolomics revealed decreased amino acids and bile acids, together with increased sphingolipids and cholesterol esters in MDD. Notably, metabolites involved in arginine and proline metabolism were decreased while sphingolipid metabolic pathway were increased. Mass cytometry analysis of blood immune cell subtypes showed rises in proinflammatory immune subsets and declines in anti-inflammatory immune subsets in MDD. Furthermore, our findings revealed disease severity-related factors of MDD. Interestingly, we classified MDD into two immune subtypes that were highly correlated with disease relapse. Moreover, we established discriminative signatures that differentiate MDD from HC. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the MDD pathogenesis and provide valuable resources for the discovery of biomarkers.

## Synthetic microbe-to-plant communication channels.
 28.02.2024, _A Boo, T Toth, Q Yu, A Pfotenhauer, BD Fields, SC Lenaghan, CN Stewart, CA Voigt_


Plants and microbes communicate to collaborate to stop pests, scavenge nutrients, and react to environmental change. Microbiota consisting of thousands of species interact with each other and plants using a large chemical language that is interpreted by complex regulatory networks. In this work, we develop modular interkingdom communication channels, enabling bacteria to convey environmental stimuli to plants. We introduce a "sender device" in Pseudomonas putida and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that produces the small molecule p-coumaroyl-homoserine lactone (pC-HSL) when the output of a sensor or circuit turns on. This molecule triggers a "receiver device" in the plant to activate gene expression. We validate this system in Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum tuberosum (potato) grown hydroponically and in soil, demonstrating its modularity by swapping bacteria that process different stimuli, including IPTG, aTc and arsenic. Programmable communication channels between bacteria and plants will enable microbial sentinels to transmit information to crops and provide the building blocks for designing artificial consortia.

## Time-shifted expression of acetoclastic and methylotrophic methanogenesis by a single Methanosarcina genomospecies predominates the methanogen dynamics in Philippine rice field soil.

The final step in the anaerobic decomposition of biopolymers is methanogenesis. Rice field soils are a major anthropogenic source of methane, with straw commonly used as a fertilizer in rice farming. Here, we aimed to decipher the structural and functional responses of the methanogenic community to rice straw addition during an extended anoxic incubation (120 days) of Philippine paddy soil. The research combined process measurements, quantitative real-time PCR and RT-PCR of particular biomarkers (16S rRNA, mcrA), and meta-omics (environmental genomics and transcriptomics).

## Influence of climatic variation on microbial communities during organic Pinot noir wine production.
 28.02.2024, _A Ohwofasa, M Dhami, J Zhang, B Tian, C Winefield, SLW On_


To assess the possible impact of climatic variation on microbial community composition in organic winemaking, we employed a metabarcoding approach to scrutinize the microbiome in a commercial, organic, Pinot noir wine production system that utilizes autochthonous fermentation. We assessed microbial composition across two vintages (2018 and 2021) using biological replicates co-located at the same winery. Microbial dynamics were monitored over four important fermentation time points and correlated with contemporaneous climate data. Bacterial (RANOSIM = 0.4743, p = 0.0001) and fungal (RANOSIM = 0.4738, p = 0.0001) compositions were different in both vintages. For bacteria, Lactococcus dominated the diversity associated with the 2018 vintage, while Tatumella dominated the 2021 vintage. For fungal populations, while Saccharomyces were abundant in both vintages, key differences included Starmerella, copious in the 2018 vintage; and Metschnikowia, substantive in the 2021 vintage. Ordination plots correlated the climatic variables with microbial population differences, indicating temperature as a particularly important influence; humidity values also differed significantly between these vintages. Our data illustrates how climatic conditions may influence microbial diversity during winemaking, and further highlights the effect climate change could have on wine production.
