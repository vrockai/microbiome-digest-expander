This study aimed to evaluate the effect of L-tryptophan (L-TRP) used in the cultivation of Lolium perenne on the yield, chemical and microbiological quality of its herbage and silage. L-TRP was applied in doses of 5 kg ha-1 , 0.5 kg ha-1 , 0.05 kg ha-1 . The experiment was conducted with a control group (C) and a comparative control group (C+) with higher nitrogen fertilization.
