## The role of the glycome in symbiotic host-microbe interactions.
 23.09.2023, _R Aminov, L Aminova_


Glycosylation plays a crucial role in many aspects of cell biology, including cellular and organismal integrity, structure-and-function of many glycosylated molecules in the cell, signal transduction, development, cancer, and in a number of diseases. Besides, at the inter-organismal level of interaction, a variety of glycosylated molecules are involved in the host-microbiota recognition and initiation of downstream signalling cascades depending on the outcomes of the glycome-mediated ascertainment. The role of glycosylation in host-microbe interactions is better elaborated within the context of virulence and pathogenicity in bacterial infection processes but the symbiotic host-microbe relationships also involve substantive glycome-mediated interactions. The works in the latter field have been reviewed to a much lesser extent, and the main aim of this mini-review is to compensate for this deficiency and summarise the role of glycomics in host-microbe symbiotic interactions.

## Microbiome-targeted interventions for the control of oral-gut dysbiosis and chronic systemic inflammation.
 20.09.2023, _J Pacheco-Yanes, E Reynolds, J Li, E Mariño_


Recent research has confirmed the strong connection between imbalances in the oral and gut microbiome (oral-gut dysbiosis), periodontitis, and inflammatory conditions such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular diseases. Microbiome modulation is crucial for preventing and treating several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis. However, the causal relationships between the microbiome and its derived metabolites that mediate periodontitis and chronic inflammation constitute a notable knowledge gap. Here we review the mechanisms involved in the microbiome-host crosstalk, and describe novel precision medicine for the control of systemic inflammation. As microbiome-targeted therapies begin to enter clinical trials, the success of these approaches relies upon understanding these reciprocal microbiome-host interactions, and it may provide new therapeutic avenues to reduce the risk of periodontitis-associated diseases.

## The link between the gut microbiome, inflammation, and Parkinson's disease.
 22.09.2023, _S Nie, Y Ge_


As our society ages, the growing number of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) puts tremendous pressure on our society. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PD, so there is an urgent need to find new treatment options. In recent years, increasing studies have shown a strong link between gut microbes and PD. In this review, recent advances in research on gut microbes in PD patients were summarized. Increased potential pro-inflammatory microbes and decreased potential anti-inflammatory microbes are prominent features of gut microbiota in PD patients. These changes may lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory substances (such as lipopolysaccharide and H2S) and a decrease in anti-inflammatory substances (such as short-chain fatty acids) to promote inflammation in the gut. This gut microbiota-mediated inflammation will lead to pathological α-synuclein accumulation in the gut, and the inflammation and α-synuclein can spread to the brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, thereby promoting neuroinflammation, apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons, and ultimately the development of PD. This review also showed that therapies based on gut microbiota may have a bright future for PD. However, more research and new approaches are still needed to clarify the causal relationship between gut microbes and PD and to determine whether therapies based on gut microbiota are effective in PD patients. KEY POINTS: • There is a strong association between gut microbes and PD. • Inflammation mediated by gut microbes may promote the development of PD. • Therapies based on the gut microbiome provide a promising strategy for PD prevention.

## The edible plant microbiome: evidence for the occurrence of fruit and vegetable bacteria in the human gut.

_Humans, Vegetables, Plants, Edible, Fruit, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Microbiota, Bacteria_
Diversity of the gut microbiota is crucial for human health. However, whether fruit and vegetable associated bacteria contribute to overall gut bacterial diversity is still unknown. We reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes from 156 fruit and vegetable metagenomes to investigate the prevalence of associated bacteria in 2,426 publicly available gut metagenomes. The microbiomes of fresh fruits and vegetables and the human gut are represented by members in common such as Enterobacterales, Burkholderiales, and Lactobacillales. Exposure to bacteria via fruit and vegetable consumption potentially has a beneficial impact on the functional diversity of gut microbiota particularly due to the presence of putative health-promoting genes for the production of vitamin and short-chain fatty acids. In the human gut, they were consistently present, although at a low abundance, approx. 2.2%. Host age, vegetable consumption frequency, and the diversity of plants consumed were drivers favoring a higher proportion. Overall, these results provide one of the primary links between the human microbiome and the environmental microbiome. This study revealed evidence that fruit and vegetable-derived microbes could be found in the human gut and contribute to gut microbiome diversity.

## Reducing gut microbiome-driven adipose tissue inflammation alleviates metabolic syndrome.

The gut microbiota contributes to macrophage-mediated inflammation in adipose tissue with consumption of an obesogenic diet, thus driving the development of metabolic syndrome. There is a need to identify and develop interventions that abrogate this condition. The hops-derived prenylated flavonoid xanthohumol (XN) and its semi-synthetic derivative tetrahydroxanthohumol (TXN) attenuate high-fat diet-induced obesity, hepatosteatosis, and metabolic syndrome in C57Bl/6J mice. This coincides with a decrease in pro-inflammatory gene expression in the gut and adipose tissue, together with alterations in the gut microbiota and bile acid composition.
