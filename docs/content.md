African populations provide a unique opportunity to interrogate host-microbe co-evolution and its impact on adaptive phenotypes due to their genomic, phenotypic, and cultural diversity. We integrate gut microbiome 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequence data with quantification of pathogen burden and measures of immune parameters for 575 ethnically diverse Africans from Cameroon. Subjects followed pastoralist, agropastoralist, and hunter-gatherer lifestyles and were compared to an urban US population from Philadelphia.

## Ethnic diversity in infant gut microbiota is apparent before the introduction of complementary diets.

The human gut microbiota develops soon after birth and can acquire inter-individual variation upon exposure to intrinsic and environmental cues. However, inter-individual variation has not been comprehensively assessed in a multi-ethnic study. We studied a longitudinal birth cohort of 106 infants of three Asian ethnicities (Chinese, Malay, and Indian) that resided in the same geographical location (Singapore). Specific and temporal influences of ethnicity, mode of delivery, breastfeeding status, gestational age, birthweight, gender, and maternal education on the development of the gut microbiota in the first 2 years of life were studied. Mode of delivery, breastfeeding status, and ethnicity were identified as the main factors influencing the compositional development of the gut microbiota. Effects of delivery mode and breastfeeding status lasted until 6M and 3M, respectively, with the primary impact on the diversity and temporal colonization of the genera Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. The effect of ethnicity was apparent at 3M post-birth, even before the introduction of weaning (complementary) foods, and remained significant after adjusting for delivery mode and breastfeeding status. Ethnic influences remained significant until 12M in the Indian and Chinese infants. The microbiota of Indian infants was characterized by higher abundances of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, while Chinese infants had higher abundances of Bacteroides and Akkermansia. These findings provide a detailed insight into the specific and temporal influences of early life factors and ethnicity in the development of the human gut microbiota. Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov registration no. NCT01174875.

## Dissimilarity of Airway and Lung Tissue Microbiota in Smokers undergoing Surgery for Lung Cancer.

Human airways are continuously colonized by microaspiration of microbiota. Less is known about the presence, origin and composition of microbiota in the lung parenchyma. In a study of 13 patients undergoing surgery for peripheral lung cancer microbiota composition was comparatively evaluated in upper airway, lower airway and lung tissue samples using 16S rDNA analysis. Bacterial density decreased stepwise from upper to lower airways and tissue. On a taxonomic level upper and lower airway microbiota were similar whereas lung tissue showed marked dissimilarities compared to lower airways that may reflect different environmental conditions shaping local microbiota and host immunity.
