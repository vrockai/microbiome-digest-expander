## Genetic Polymorphisms in Inflammatory and Other Regulators in Gastric Cancer: Risks and Clinical Consequences.
 19.07.2019, _K Rudnicka, S Backert, M Chmiela_

Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with the development of a chronic inflammatory response, which may induce peptic ulcers, gastric cancer (GC), and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Chronic H. pylori infection promotes the genetic instability of gastric epithelial cells and interferes with the DNA repair systems in host cells. Colonization of the stomach with H. pylori is an important cause of non-cardia GC and gastric MALT lymphoma. The reduction of GC development in patients who underwent anti-H. pylori eradication schemes has also been well described. Individual susceptibility to GC development depends on the host's genetic predisposition, H. pylori virulence factors, environmental conditions, and geographical determinants. Biological determinants are urgently sought to predict the clinical course of infection in individuals with confirmed H. pylori infection. Possible candidates for such biomarkers include genetic aberrations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in various cytokines/growth factors (e.g., IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A/B, IFN-γ, TNF, TGF-β) and their receptors (IL-RN, TGFR), innate immunity receptors (TLR2, TLR4, CD14, NOD1, NOD2), enzymes involved in signal transduction cascades (PLCE1, PKLR, PRKAA1) as well as glycoproteins (MUC1, PSCA), and DNA repair enzymes (ERCC2, XRCC1, XRCC3). Bacterial determinants related to GC development include infection with CagA-positive (particularly with a high number of EPIYA-C phosphorylation motifs) and VacA-positive isolates (in particular s1/m1 allele strains). The combined genotyping of bacterial and host determinants suggests that the accumulation of polymorphisms favoring host and bacterial features increases the risk for precancerous and cancerous lesions in patients.

## From Association to Causality: the Role of the Gut Microbiota and Its Functional Products on Host Metabolism.
 05.04.2020, _A Koh, F Bäckhed_


Many genomic studies have revealed associations between the gut microbiota composition and host metabolism. These observations led to the idea that a causal relationship could exist between the microbiota and metabolic diseases, a concept supported by studies showing compositional changes in the microbial community in metabolic diseases and transmissibility of host phenotype via microbiota transfer. Accumulating data suggest that the microbiota may affect host metabolic phenotypes through the production of metabolites. These bioactive microbial metabolites, sensitive fingerprints of microbial function, can act as inter-kingdom signaling messengers via penetration into host blood circulation and tissues. These fingerprints may be used for diagnostic purposes, and increased understanding of strain specificity in producing microbial metabolites can identify bacterial strains or specific metabolites that can be used for therapeutic purposes. Here, we will review data supporting the causal role of the gut microbiota in metabolism and discuss mechanisms and potential clinical implications.

## Breast Milk and Microbiota in the Premature Gut: A Method of Preventing Necrotizing Enterocolitis.
 01.04.2020, _WA Walker, D Meng_


Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating inflammatory condition of the intestine, which affects premature infants and causes untold damage. Its pathogenesis has to do with how colonizing bacteria interact with the immature newborn intestine. An immature innate immune response with increased TLR-4 on the cell surface and increased signaling molecules, such as NF-κB, can cause excessive inflammation. This is in conjunction with a decrease in the appearance of regulatory molecules which effect the control of innate responses. This condition is so devastating that it must be prevented and not treated. Fortunately, breast milk and probiotics can affect the condition leading to reduced inflammation. How does this effect work? We have shown that breast milk tryptophan and Bifidobacterium infantis result in a metabolite (indole-3-lactic acid) response, which is anti-inflammatory via inhibition of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor transcription factor which stimulates an IL-8 response. We have also shown that breast milk complex carbohydrates interacting with Bacteroides fragilis can cause short-chain fatty acids which exert anti-inflammatory effects on the newborn intestine. These breast milk metabolites could help prevent NEC if shown to be effective clinically.
