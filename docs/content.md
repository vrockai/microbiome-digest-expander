The myriad microorganisms that live in close association with humans have diverse effects on physiology, yet the molecular bases for these impacts remain mostly unknown1-3. Classical pathogens often invade host tissues and modulate immune responses through interactions with human extracellular and secreted proteins (the 'exoproteome'). Commensal microorganisms may also facilitate niche colonization and shape host biology by engaging host exoproteins; however, direct exoproteome-microbiota interactions remain largely unexplored. Here we developed and validated a novel technology, BASEHIT, that enables proteome-scale assessment of human exoproteome-microbiome interactions. Using BASEHIT, we interrogated more than 1.7 million potential interactions between 519 human-associated bacterial strains from diverse phylogenies and tissues of origin and 3,324 human exoproteins. The resulting interactome revealed an extensive network of transkingdom connectivity consisting of thousands of previously undescribed host-microorganism interactions involving 383 strains and 651 host proteins. Specific binding patterns within this network implied underlying biological logic; for example, conspecific strains exhibited shared exoprotein-binding patterns, and individual tissue isolates uniquely bound tissue-specific exoproteins. Furthermore, we observed dozens of unique and often strain-specific interactions with potential roles in niche colonization, tissue remodelling and immunomodulation, and found that strains with differing host interaction profiles had divergent interactions with host cells in vitro and effects on the host immune system in vivo. Overall, these studies expose a previously unexplored landscape of molecular-level host-microbiota interactions that may underlie causal effects of indigenous microorganisms on human health and disease.

The gut microbiota is recognized as a regulator of brain development and behavioral outcomes during childhood. Nonetheless, associations between the gut microbiota and behavior are often inconsistent among studies in humans, perhaps because many host-microbe relationships vary widely between individuals. This study aims to stratify children based on their gut microbiota composition (i.e., clusters) and to identify novel gut microbiome cluster-specific associations between the stool metabolomic pathways and child behavioral outcomes.

The oral and gastrointestinal mucosae represent the main targets of the toxic effect of chemo and/or radiotherapy administered during the conditioning regimen before hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). These harmful consequences and the immunological complications that may occur after the transplant (such as Graft versus Host Disease, GvHD) are responsible for the clinical symptoms associated with mucositis during the aplasia phase, like pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These toxicities could play a critical role in the oral and gastrointestinal microbiomes during the post-transplant phase, and the degree of microbial dysbiosis and dysregulation among different bacterial species could also be crucial in intestinal mucosa homeostasis, altering the host's innate and adaptive immune responses and favoring abnormal immune responses responsible for the occurrence of GvHD. This prospective pediatric study aims to analyze longitudinally oral and gut microbiomes in 17 pediatric patients who received allogeneic HSCT for malignant and non-malignant diseases. The oral mucositis was mainly associated with an increased relative abundance of Fusobacteria, and Prevotella species, while Streptococcus descendants showed a negative correlation. The fecal microbiome of subjects affected by cutaneous acute GvHD (aGvHD) correlated with Proteobacteria. Oral mucosal microbiota undergoes changes after HSCT, Fusobacteria, and Prevotella represent bacterial species associated with mucositis and they could be the target for future therapeutic approaches, while fecal microbiome in patients with acute GvHD (aGvHD) revealed an increase of different class of Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria) and a negative correlation with the class of Gammaproteobacteria.

Although the human bladder is reported to harbor unique microbiota, our understanding of how these microbial communities interact with their human hosts is limited, mostly owing to the lack of isolates to test mechanistic hypotheses. Niche-specific bacterial collections and associated reference genome databases have been instrumental in expanding knowledge of the microbiota of other anatomical sites, such as the gut and oral cavity.

## Integrative metagenomic and metabolomic analyses reveal the potential of gut microbiota to exacerbate acute pancreatitis.

Early dysbiosis in the gut microbiota may contribute to the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP), however, a comprehensive understanding of the gut microbiome, potential pathobionts, and host metabolome in individuals with AP remains elusive. Hence, we employed fecal whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing in 82 AP patients and 115 matched healthy controls, complemented by untargeted serum metabolome and lipidome profiling in a subset of participants. Analyses of the gut microbiome in AP patients revealed reduced diversity, disrupted microbial functions, and altered abundance of 77 species, influenced by both etiology and severity. AP-enriched species, mostly potential pathobionts, correlated positively with host liver function and serum lipid indicators. Conversely, many AP-depleted species were short-chain fatty acid producers. Gut microflora changes were accompanied by shifts in the serum metabolome and lipidome. Specifically, certain gut species, like enriched Bilophila wadsworthia and depleted Bifidobacterium spp., appeared to contribute to elevated triglyceride levels in biliary or hyperlipidemic AP patients. Through culturing and whole-genome sequencing of bacterial isolates, we identified virulence factors and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in patient-derived strains, suggesting a predisposition to opportunistic infections. Finally, our study demonstrated that gavage of specific pathobionts could exacerbate pancreatitis in a caerulein-treated mouse model. In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis sheds light on the gut microbiome and serum metabolome in AP, elucidating the role of pathobionts in disease progression. These insights offer valuable perspectives for etiologic diagnosis, prevention, and intervention in AP and related conditions.

## A specific enterotype derived from gut microbiome of older individuals enables favorable responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but inconsistent responses persist. Our study delves into the intriguing phenomenon of enhanced immunotherapy sensitivity in older individuals with cancers. Through a meta-analysis encompassing 25 small-to-mid-sized trials of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), we demonstrate that older individuals exhibit heightened responsiveness to ICB therapy. To understand the underlying mechanism, we reanalyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple studies and unveil distinct upregulation of exhausted and cytotoxic T cell markers within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of older patients. Recognizing the potential role of gut microbiota in modulating the efficacy of immunotherapy, we identify an aging-enriched enterotype linked to improved immunotherapy outcomes in older patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments in mice confirm the therapeutic potential of the aging-enriched enterotype, enhancing treatment sensitivity and reshaping the TME. Our discoveries confront the prevailing paradox and provide encouraging paths for tailoring cancer immunotherapy strategies according to an individual's gut microbiome profile.

## HPV-associated cervicovaginal microbiome and host metabolome characteristics.
 23.03.2024, _Y Zhang, X Wu, D Li, R Huang, X Deng, M Li, F Du, Y Zhao, J Shen, Y Chen, P Zhang, C Hu, Z Xiao, Q Wen_


Cervicovaginal microbiome plays an important role in the persistence of HPV infection and subsequent disease development. However, cervicovaginal microbiota varied cross populations with different habits and regions. Identification of population-specific biomarkers from cervicovaginal microbiota and host metabolome axis may support early detection or surveillance of HPV-induced cervical disease at all sites. Therefore, in the present study, to identify HPV-specific biomarkers, cervicovaginal secretion and serum samples from HPV-infected patients (HPV group, n = 25) and normal controls (normal group, n = 17) in Xichang, China were collected for microbiome (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and metabolome (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis, respectively.

## Mediterranean diet: a potential player in the link between oral microbiome and oral diseases.
 22.03.2024, _G Augimeri, G Caparello, I Caputo, R Reda, L Testarelli, D Bonofiglio_


The oral microbiome is a complex and dynamic assemblage of microorganisms that colonize different sites of the oral cavity maintaining both oral and systemic health. Therefore, when its composition is altered, oral diseases occur. Among oral inflammatory pathologies, periodontal diseases affect the tissues surrounding the teeth, representing the main cause of tooth loss and one of the most important threats to the oral health. Lifestyle and eating habits influence the composition of the human oral microbiota and the development and progression of oral diseases. In this context, the Mediterranean Diet (MD) model, comprising both healthy dietary choices and lifestyle, is linked to the prevention of several metabolic and chronic-degenerative pathological processes, including oral diseases. Indeed, the MD is a plant-based diet, enriched of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant nutrients, which may induce beneficial effects against dental caries and periodontal diseases.
