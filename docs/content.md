This study aimed to determine the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and aerobic vaginitis (AV) and their associated risk factors among pregnant women from Ethiopia. Also, this study investigated the bacterial pathogens and their antibiotic resistance in AV cases. A total of 422 pregnant women from northern Ethiopia were participated in this study. Socio-demographic and clinical data were recorded. Vaginal swabs were collected and used for wet mount and Gram stain methods to evaluate the AV and BV scores according to the Nugent's and Donder's criteria, respectively. In AV cases the bacterial pathogens and their antibiotic resistance were determined using standard methods. The possible risk factors for AV and BV in pregnant women were investigated. The prevalence rates of BV and AV were 20.1% (85/422) and 8.1% (34/422), respectively. BV was more common in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic people (P &lt; 0.001), and in second trimester vs. first trimester samples (P = 0.042). However, AV was more common in secondary school vs. primary and those who were unable to read and write (P = 0.021) and in housewife women vs. employee (P = 0.013). A total of 44 bacterial strains were isolated from AV cases, of which the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (38.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (29.5%) were the most predominant bacteria, respectively. The highest resistance rate was observed against penicillin (100.0%) in staphylococci, while 86.7% of them were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The resistance rate of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.0% for ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol to 100.0% against amoxicillin/clavulanate. The prevalence of BV was higher than AV in pregnant women. This higher prevalence of BV suggests that measures should be taken to reduce the undesired consequences related to BV in the pregnancy. The circulation of drug-resistant bacteria in vaginal infections requires a global surveillance to reduce the risks to pregnant mothers and infants.

## Systematically assessing microbiome-disease associations identifies drivers of inconsistency in metagenomic research.
 02.03.2022, _BT Tierney, Y Tan, Z Yang, B Shui, MJ Walker, BM Kent, AD Kostic, CJ Patel_


Evaluating the relationship between the human gut microbiome and disease requires computing reliable statistical associations. Here, using millions of different association modeling strategies, we evaluated the consistency-or robustness-of microbiome-based disease indicators for 6 prevalent and well-studied phenotypes (across 15 public cohorts and 2,343 individuals). We were able to discriminate between analytically robust versus nonrobust results. In many cases, different models yielded contradictory associations for the same taxon-disease pairing, some showing positive correlations and others negative. When querying a subset of 581 microbe-disease associations that have been previously reported in the literature, 1 out of 3 taxa demonstrated substantial inconsistency in association sign. Notably, &gt;90% of published findings for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were particularly nonrobust in this regard. We additionally quantified how potential confounders-sequencing depth, glucose levels, cholesterol, and body mass index, for example-influenced associations, analyzing how these variables affect the ostensible correlation between Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance and a healthy gut. Overall, we propose our approach as a method to maximize confidence when prioritizing findings that emerge from microbiome association studies.

## Gut microbiome dysbiosis during COVID-19 is associated with increased risk for bacteremia and microbial translocation.
 12.11.2021, _M Venzon, L Bernard-Raichon, J Klein, J Axelrad, G Hussey, A Sullivan, A Casanovas-Massana, M Noval, A Valero-Jimenez, J Gago, E Wilder, YIR Team, A Iwasaki, L Thorpe, D Littman, M Dittmann, K Stapleford, B Shopsin, V Torres, A Ko, K Cadwell, J Schluter_


The microbial populations in the gut microbiome have recently been associated with COVID-19 disease severity. However, a causal impact of the gut microbiome on COVID-19 patient health has not been established. Here we provide evidence that gut microbiome dysbiosis is associated with translocation of bacteria into the blood during COVID-19, causing life-threatening secondary infections. Antibiotics and other treatments during COVID-19 can potentially confound microbiome associations. We therefore first demonstrate that the gut microbiome is directly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner in a mouse model, causally linking viral infection and gut microbiome dysbiosis. Comparison with stool samples collected from 97 COVID-19 patients at two different clinical sites also revealed substantial gut microbiome dysbiosis, paralleling our observations in the animal model. Specifically, we observed blooms of opportunistic pathogenic bacterial genera known to include antimicrobial-resistant species in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Analysis of blood culture results testing for secondary microbial bloodstream infections with paired microbiome data obtained from these patients suggest that bacteria translocate from the gut into the systemic circulation of COVID-19 patients. These results are consistent with a direct role for gut microbiome dysbiosis in enabling dangerous secondary infections during COVID 19.

## Hydrogen-producing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is associated with hepatic encephalopathy and liver function.

Overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is one of the complications of liver cirrhosis (LC), which negatively affects the prognosis and quality of life of patients. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is significantly associated with LC and its complications, including HE. We investigated the relationship between SIBO and LC, and the difference between hydrogen-producing and methane-producing SIBO (H-SIBO and M-SIBO, respectively). This is a prospective cohort study of 107 cases. Breath measurements of hydrogen and methane concentrations were performed for the diagnosis of SIBO. The study cohort included 81 males with a median age of 70 (40-86) years, and SIBO was detected in 31 cases (29.0%). There were no significant differences between the SIBO positive and SIBO negative groups. Reclassification into H-SIBO (16 cases) and others (91 cases) was performed, and the Child-Pugh score was only derived in the multivariate logistic analysis (P = 0.028, odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.85). Furthermore, H-SIBO was significantly associated with covert HE in chi-square test (50.0% vs. 24.2%, P = 0.034). In addition, we evaluated the therapeutic response on SIBO of rifaximin in eight covert HE patients. 20% patients with M-SIBO and 67% patients with H-SIBO showed an improvement of the breath test. In conclusion, H-SIBO, but not M-SIBO, is significantly associated with liver function, and rifaximin might be more effective for covert HE with H-SIBO. Therefore, the diagnosis of SIBO, including the classification as H-SIBO and M-SIBO, might help to determine the choice of treatment for HE.

## Bacterial age distribution in soil-Generational gaps in adjacent hot and cold spots.
 25.02.2022, _B Borer, D Or_


Resource patchiness and aqueous phase fragmentation in soil may induce large differences local growth conditions at submillimeter scales. These are translated to vast differences in bacterial age from cells dividing every thirty minutes in close proximity to plant roots to very old cells experiencing negligible growth in adjacent nutrient poor patches. In this study, we link bacterial population demographics with localized soil and hydration conditions to predict emerging generation time distributions and estimate mean bacterial cell ages using mechanistic and heuristic models of bacterial life in soil. Results show heavy-tailed distributions of generation times that resemble a power law for certain conditions, suggesting that we may find bacterial cells of vastly different ages living side by side within small soil volumes. Our results imply that individual bacteria may exist concurrently with all of their ancestors, resulting in an archive of bacterial cells with traits that have been gained (and lost) throughout time-a feature unique to microbial life. This reservoir of bacterial strains and the potential for the reemergence of rare strains with specific functions may be critical for ecosystem stability and function.
