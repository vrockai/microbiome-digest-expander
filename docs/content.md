## Gut microbiota, NLR proteins, and intestinal homeostasis.
 17.09.2020, _H Guo, SA Gibson, JPY Ting_


The gastrointestinal tract harbors a highly complex microbial community, which is referred to as gut microbiota. With increasing evidence suggesting that the imbalance of gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, interactions between the host immune system and the gut microbiota are now attracting emerging interest. Nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs) encompass a large number of innate immune sensors and receptors, which mediate the activation of Caspase-1 and the subsequent release of mature interleukin-1β and interleukin-18. Several family members have been found to restrain rather than activate inflammatory cytokines and immune signaling. NLR family members are central regulators of pathogen recognition, host immunity, and inflammation with utmost importance in human diseases. In this review, we focus on the potential roles played by NLRs in controlling and shaping the microbiota community and discuss how the functional axes interconnecting gut microbiota with NLRs impact the modulation of colitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and colorectal cancer.

## Lenvatinib: A Promising Molecular Targeted Agent for Multiple Cancers.

Lenvatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR1-3), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1-4), platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and rearranged during transfection (RET). These receptors are important for tumor angiogenesis, and lenvatinib inhibits tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting function of these receptors. Phase I trials of lenvatinib were conducted at the same time in Japan, Europe, and the United States, and tumor shrinkage effects were observed in thyroid cancer, endometrial cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, sarcoma, and colon cancer. Lenvatinib is a promising drug that has shown therapeutic effects against various solid tumors. Adverse events, such as hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhea, and delayed wound healing, can occur with lenvatinib treatment. Managing these adverse events is also important for the use of lenvatinib. In this mini-review article, we outline the current state, toxicity, and future prospects of lenvatinib toward thyroid cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and lung cancer.

## Estimate of the sequenced proportion of the global prokaryotic genome.
 17.09.2020, _Z Zhang, J Wang, J Wang, J Wang, Y Li_


Sequencing prokaryotic genomes has revolutionized our understanding of the many roles played by microorganisms. However, the cell and taxon proportions of genome-sequenced bacteria or archaea on earth remain unknown. This study aimed to explore this basic question using large-scale alignment between the sequences released by the Earth Microbiome Project and 155,810 prokaryotic genomes from public databases.

## Microbial dark matter filling the niche in hypersaline microbial mats.
 17.09.2020, _HL Wong, FI MacLeod, RA White, PT Visscher, BP Burns_


Shark Bay, Australia, harbours one of the most extensive and diverse systems of living microbial mats that are proposed to be analogs of some of the earliest ecosystems on Earth. These ecosystems have been shown to possess a substantial abundance of uncultivable microorganisms. These enigmatic microbes, jointly coined as 'microbial dark matter' (MDM), are hypothesised to play key roles in modern microbial mats.

## Pan-genome study of Thermococcales reveals extensive genetic diversity and genetic evidence of thermophilic adaption.
 17.09.2020, _C Zhong, L Wang, K Ning_


Thermococcales has a strong adaptability to extreme environments, which is of profound interest in explaining how complex life forms emerge on earth. However, their gene composition, thermal stability and evolution in hyperthermal environments are still little known. Here, we characterized the pan-genome architecture of 30 Thermococcales species to gain insight into their genetic properties, evolutionary patterns, and specific metabolisms adapted to niches. We revealed an open pan-genome of Thermococcales comprising 6,070 gene families that tends to increase with the availability of additional genomes. The genome contents of Thermococcales were flexible, with a series of genes experienced gene duplication, progressive divergence, or gene gain and loss events exhibiting distinct functional features. These archaea had concise types of heat shock proteins, such as HSP20, HSP60 and prefoldin, which were constrained by strong purifying selection that governed their conservative evolution. Furthermore, purifying selection forced genes involved in enzyme, motility, secretion system, defense system and chaperones to differ in functional constraints and their disparity in the rate of evolution may be related to adaptation to specific niche. These results deepened our understanding of genetic diversity and adaptation patterns of Thermococcales, and provided valuable research models for studying the metabolic traits of early life forms.
