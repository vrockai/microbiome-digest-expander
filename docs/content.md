Dimeric IgA secreted across mucous membranes in response to nonpathogenic taxa of the microbiota accounts for most antibody production in mammals. Diverse binding specificities can be detected within the polyclonal mucosal IgA antibody response1-10, but limited monoclonal hybridomas have been studied to relate antigen specificity or polyreactive binding to functional effects on microbial physiology in vivo11-17. Here we use recombinant dimeric monoclonal IgAs (mIgAs) to finely map the intestinal plasma cell response to microbial colonization with a single microorganism in mice. We identify a range of antigen-specific mIgA molecules targeting defined surface and nonsurface membrane antigens. Secretion of individual dimeric mIgAs targeting different antigens in vivo showed distinct alterations in the function and metabolism of intestinal bacteria, largely through specific binding. Even in cases in which the same microbial antigen is targeted, microbial metabolic alterations differed depending on IgA epitope specificity. By contrast, bacterial surface coating generally reduced motility and limited bile acid toxicity. The overall intestinal IgA response to a single microbe therefore contains parallel components with distinct effects on microbial carbon-source uptake, bacteriophage susceptibility, motility and membrane integrity.

## Hallstatt miners consumed blue cheese and beer during the Iron Age and retained a non-Westernized gut microbiome until the Baroque period.

We subjected human paleofeces dating from the Bronze Age to the Baroque period (18th century AD) to in-depth microscopic, metagenomic, and proteomic analyses. The paleofeces were preserved in the underground salt mines of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Hallstatt in Austria. This allowed us to reconstruct the diet of the former population and gain insights into their ancient gut microbiome composition. Our dietary survey identified bran and glumes of different cereals as some of the most prevalent plant fragments. This highly fibrous, carbohydrate-rich diet was supplemented with proteins from broad beans and occasionally with fruits, nuts, or animal food products. Due to these traditional dietary habits, all ancient miners up to the Baroque period have gut microbiome structures akin to modern non-Westernized individuals whose diets are also mainly composed of unprocessed foods and fresh fruits and vegetables. This may indicate a shift in the gut community composition of modern Westernized populations due to quite recent dietary and lifestyle changes. When we extended our microbial survey to fungi present in the paleofeces, in one of the Iron Age samples, we observed a high abundance of Penicillium roqueforti and Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA. Genome-wide analysis indicates that both fungi were involved in food fermentation and provides the first molecular evidence for blue cheese and beer consumption in Iron Age Europe.

## In vitro study of the effect of quinoa and quinoa polysaccharides on human gut microbiota.
 15.10.2021, _H Zeyneb, H Pei, X Cao, Y Wang, Y Win, L Gong_


It has been shown that whole grains and dietary fiber are important for their fermentation characteristics in the large intestine, drawing more and more attention to quinoa and quinoa polysaccharides. In this study, we evaluated the prebiotic effect of quinoa seeds and quinoa polysaccharides after human simulated digestion. The modulatory effect of the quinoa and quinoa polysaccharides (QPs) on the gut microbiota was evaluated by the in vitro fermentation using human fecal microbiota. The yield of polysaccharides extraction was 15.45%. The digestibility of the cooked and uncooked quinoa after simulation of human digestion was 69.04% and 64.09%, respectively. The effect on the microbiota composition and their metabolic products was determined by the assessment of pH, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and changes in the bacterial population. After 24 hr anaerobic incubation, the total SCFAs of cooked, uncooked quinoa, and quinoa polysaccharides were 82.99, 77.11, and 82.73 mM, respectively with a pH decrease. At the phylum, genus, and class level, it has been found that the quinoa substrates enhance the growth of certain beneficial bacteria such as Prevotella and Bacteroides. Quinoa polysaccharides can be considered prebiotic due to their ability to increase Bifidobacterium and Collinsella. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that there was a distinct modulating effect on the fecal microbiota which represents different distribution. Our research suggests that quinoa and quinoa polysaccharides have a prebiotic potential due to their association with the positive shifts in microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acids production, which highlights the importance of further studies around this topic.

## Biomarkers of geroprotection and cardiovascular health: An overview of omics studies and established clinical biomarkers in the context of diet.
 14.10.2021, _R Secci, A Hartmann, M Walter, HJ Grabe, S Van der Auwera-Palitschka, A Kowald, D Palmer, G Rimbach, G Fuellen, I Barrantes_


The slowdown, inhibition, or reversal of age-related decline (as a composite of disease, dysfunction, and, ultimately, death) by diet or natural compounds can be defined as dietary geroprotection. While there is no single reliable biomarker to judge the effects of dietary geroprotection, biomarker signatures based on omics (epigenetics, gene expression, microbiome composition) are promising candidates. Recently, omic biomarkers started to supplement established clinical ones such as lipid profiles and inflammatory cytokines. In this review, we focus on human data. We first summarize the current take on genetic biomarkers based on epidemiological studies. However, most of the remaining biomarkers that we describe, whether omics-based or clinical, are related to intervention studies. Then, because of their promising potential in the context of dietary geroprotection, we focus on the effects of berry-based interventions, which up to now have been mostly described employing clinical markers. We provide an aggregation and tabulation of all the recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses that we could find related to this topic. Finally, we present evidence for the importance of the "nutribiography," that is, the influence that an individual's history of diet and natural compound consumption can have on the effects of dietary geroprotection.

## Unravelling the collateral damage of antibiotics on gut bacteria.

Antibiotics are used to fight pathogens but also target commensal bacteria, disturbing the composition of gut microbiota and causing dysbiosis and disease1. Despite this well-known collateral damage, the activity spectrum of different antibiotic classes on gut bacteria remains poorly characterized. Here we characterize further 144 antibiotics from a previous screen of more than 1,000 drugs on 38 representative human gut microbiome species2. Antibiotic classes exhibited distinct inhibition spectra, including generation dependence for quinolones and phylogeny independence for β-lactams. Macrolides and tetracyclines, both prototypic bacteriostatic protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibited nearly all commensals tested but also killed several species. Killed bacteria were more readily eliminated from in vitro communities than those inhibited. This species-specific killing activity challenges the long-standing distinction between bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotic classes and provides a possible explanation for the strong effect of macrolides on animal3-5 and human6,7 gut microbiomes. To mitigate this collateral damage of macrolides and tetracyclines, we screened for drugs that specifically antagonized the antibiotic activity against abundant Bacteroides species but not against relevant pathogens. Such antidotes selectively protected Bacteroides species from erythromycin treatment in human-stool-derived communities and gnotobiotic mice. These findings illluminate the activity spectra of antibiotics in commensal bacteria and suggest strategies to circumvent their adverse effects on the gut microbiota.

The pregnancy vaginal microbiome contributes to risk of preterm birth, the primary cause of death in children under 5 years of age. Here we describe direct on-swab metabolic profiling by Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (DESI-MS) for sample preparation-free characterisation of the cervicovaginal metabolome in two independent pregnancy cohorts (VMET, n = 160; 455 swabs; VMET II, n = 205; 573 swabs). By integrating metataxonomics and immune profiling data from matched samples, we show that specific metabolome signatures can be used to robustly predict simultaneously both the composition of the vaginal microbiome and host inflammatory status. In these patients, vaginal microbiota instability and innate immune activation, as predicted using DESI-MS, associated with preterm birth, including in women receiving cervical cerclage for preterm birth prevention. These findings highlight direct on-swab metabolic profiling by DESI-MS as an innovative approach for preterm birth risk stratification through rapid assessment of vaginal microbiota-host dynamics.

In this issue of Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Seki et al. (2021) demonstrate an overgrowth of Klebsiella in the gut microbiota of extremely premature infants that is predictive of brain damage. The Klebsiella-associated pro-inflammatory signature suggests that aberrant microbiome-gut-brain axis signaling provokes the disruption of neurodevelopmental trajectories to exacerbate brain injury.

Patients with Crohn's disease frequently develop oral health problems and show a higher prevalence of oral manifestations, such as dental caries and periodontitis, than healthy individuals do. In this study, a metagenomic analysis was carried out to characterize the salivary microbiota in patients with either periodontitis or Crohn's disease-associated periodontitis. Saliva samples were collected from six patients with both Crohn's disease and periodontitis (Cm group), six patients with periodontitis alone (Pm group), and six healthy individuals (Hm group). Genomic DNA was collected from these samples for high-throughput Illumina HiSeq metagenomic sequencing. The composition of the bacterial communities and their metabolic pathways and gene functions were characterized and compared among the three study groups. The salivary microbial communities were significantly different among the three groups, with Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes showing the most significant differences. The Cm and Pm groups had higher abundances of Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella baroniae, Prevotella enoeca, and Prevotella dentasini than the Hm group. The Cm and Pm groups also showed differences in their salivary microbial communities, in that the Cm group had relatively high abundances of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, whereas the Pm group had relatively high abundances of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria. In total, 34 Pm-associated (e.g., Fusobacteria and Corynebacterium matruchotii), 18 Cm-associated (e.g., Capnocytophaga and Streptococcus oralis), and 18 Hm-associated (e.g., Streptococcus and Bacillales) predominant microbial species were identified. Most genes were involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, with those of the Cm and Pm groups showing more similarity to one another but significant differences from those of the Hm group. Most of the antibiotic resistance genes were found in the Pm group. In conclusion, the salivary microbial community structure and abundance were distinct among patients with Crohn's disease-associated periodontitis, patients with periodontitis, and healthy individuals. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential value of these microbiota and microbiome differences in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of oral diseases.

Poststernotomy mediastinitis (PSM) remains a serious infection and is significantly associated with high morbidity, short-term and long-term mortality. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are an underestimated cause of PSM, and there is little information on the risk factors, prevention, diagnosis and management of GNB PSM.

## Cultivation of common bacterial species and strains from human skin, oral, and gut microbiota.

Genomics-driven discoveries of microbial species have provided extraordinary insights into the biodiversity of human microbiota. In addition, a significant portion of genetic variation between microbiota exists at the subspecies, or strain, level. High-resolution genomics to investigate species- and strain-level diversity and mechanistic studies, however, rely on the availability of individual microbes from a complex microbial consortia. High-throughput approaches are needed to acquire and identify the significant species- and strain-level diversity present in the oral, skin, and gut microbiome. Here, we describe and validate a streamlined workflow for cultivating dominant bacterial species and strains from the skin, oral, and gut microbiota, informed by metagenomic sequencing, mass spectrometry, and strain profiling.

## Effect of chewing betel nut on the gut microbiota of Hainanese.
 14.10.2021, _L Ying, Y Yang, J Zhou, H Huang, G Du_


Betel nut chewing (BNC) is prevalent in South Asia and Southeast Asia. BNC can affect host health by modulating the gut microbiota. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of BNC on the gut microbiota of the host. Feces samples were obtained from 34 BNC individuals from Ledong and Lingshui, Hainan, China. The microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. BNC decreased the microbial α-diversity. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla, accounting for 99.35% of the BNC group. The Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly increased in the BNC group compared to a control group. The abundances of the families Aerococcaceae, Neisseriaceae, Moraxellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Planococcaceae were decreased in the BNC/BNC_Male/BNC_Female groups compared to the control group, whereas the abundances of Coriobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, Micrococcaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Coxiellaceae, Nocardioidaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Succinivibrionaceae were increased. In general, the gut microbiome profiles suggest that BNC may have positive effects, such as an increase in the abundance of beneficial microbes and a reduction in the abundance of disease-related microbes. However, BNC may also produce an increase in the abundance of disease-related microbes. Therefore, extraction of prebiotic components could increase the beneficial value of betel nut.

## Transplantation of fecal microbiota from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and depression alters immune response and behavior in recipient mice.
 15.10.2021, _HM Jang, JK Kim, MK Joo, YJ Shin, CK Lee, HJ Kim, DH Kim_


Gut dysbiosis is closely associated with the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psychiatric disorder. Here, to understand the difference of gut microbiota composition and physiological effect between IBD patients with (IBD/D+) or without depression (IBD/D-), we analyzed the fecal microbiota composition of patients with IBD with (/D+) or without depression (/D-) and healthy volunteers (HVs) and examined the effects of these fecal microbiota transplantations (FMTs) on the occurrence of systemic inflammation and anxiety/depression in mice. FMTs from patients with IBD/D+ or IBD/D- caused IBD-like colitis in the transplanted mice: they increased the myeloperoxidase activity, IL-1β and IL-6 expression, and NF-κB+/CD11c+ cell population in the colon. Transplantation of the IBD/D+ patient feces (IBD/D+-F) caused IBD-like colitis more strongly than that of IBD/D--F. FMTs from patients with IBD/D+ also caused anxiety-/depression-like behaviors, increased the NF-κB+/Iba1+ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+/Iba1+ cell populations, and decreased the BDNF+/NeuN+ cell population in the hippocampus. They increased LPS levels in the blood. FMTs from patients with IBD/D- caused anxiety-like, but not depression-like, behaviors. α-/β-diversities and composition of gut microbiota in IBD-F were different from those of HV feces (HV-F). The Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae populations and LPS levels were higher in the IBD-F than in the HV-F. The Enterococcaceae population was higher in IBD/D+-F vs. IBD/D--F. However, the transplantation of HV-F into mice previously transplanted with IBD/D+-F significantly reduced depression-like behaviors, NF-κB+/Iba1+ and LPS+/Iba1+ cell populations in the hippocampus, LPS levels in the feces and blood, and IL-1β expression in the colon. These findings suggest that the outbreak of depression/anxiety may be dependent on the systemic inflammation with a leaky gut through the gut dysbiosis-attributable overproduction of bacterial LPS and suppression of tight junction protein expression in patients with IBD.

## Temporal relationship between alterations in the gut microbiome and the development of polycystic ovary syndrome-like phenotypes in prenatally androgenized female mice.
 18.10.2021, _A Kusamoto, M Harada, JMK Azhary, C Kunitomi, E Nose, H Koike, Z Xu, Y Urata, T Kaku, N Takahashi, O Wada-Hiraike, Y Hirota, K Koga, T Fujii, Y Osuga_


It has been recently recognized that prenatal androgen exposure is involved in the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adulthood. In addition, the gut microbiome in adult patients and rodents with PCOS differs from that of healthy individuals. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that the gut microbiome may play a causative role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. We wondered whether prenatal androgen exposure induces gut microbial dysbiosis early in life and is associated with the development of PCOS in later life. To test this hypothesis, we studied the development of PCOS-like phenotypes in prenatally androgenized (PNA) female mice and compared the gut microbiome of PNA and control offspring from 4 to 16 weeks of age. PNA offspring showed a reproductive phenotype from 6 weeks and a metabolic phenotype from 12 weeks of age. The α-diversity of the gut microbiome of the PNA group was higher at 8 weeks and lower at 12 and 16 weeks of age, and the β-diversity differed from control at 8 weeks. However, a significant difference in the composition of gut microbiome between the PNA and control groups was already apparent at 4 weeks. Allobaculum and Roseburia were less abundant in PNA offspring, and may therefore be targets for future interventional studies. In conclusion, abnormalities in the gut microbiome appear as early as or even before PCOS-like phenotypes develop in PNA mice. Thus, the gut microbiome in early life is a potential target for the prevention of PCOS in later life.

## Gut microbiota dysbiosis of type 2 diabetic mice impairs the intestinal daily rhythms of GLP-1 sensitivity.
 14.10.2021, _E Grasset, A Puel, J Charpentier, P Klopp, JE Christensen, B Lelouvier, F Servant, V Blasco-Baque, F Tercé, R Burcelin_


The gut-brain-beta cell glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-dependent axis and the clock genes both control insulin secretion. Evidence shows that a keystone of this molecular interaction could be the gut microbiota. We analyzed in mice the circadian profile of GLP-1 sensitivity on insulin secretion and the impact of the autonomic neuropathy, antibiotic treated in different diabetic mouse models and in germ-free colonized mice. We show that GLP-1sensitivity is maximal during the dark feeding period, i.e., the postprandial state. Coincidently, the ileum expression of GLP-1 receptor and peripherin is increased and tightly correlated with a subset of clock gene. Since both are markers of enteric neurons, it suggests a role in the gut-brain-beta cell GLP-1-dependent axis. We evaluated the importance of gut microbiota dysbiosis and found that the abundance of ileum bacteria, particularly Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, oscillated diurnally, with a maximum during the dark period, along with expression patterns of a subset of clock genes. This diurnal pattern of circadian gene expression and Lachnospiraceae abundance was also observed in two separate mouse models of gut microbiota dysbiosis and of autonomic neuropathy with impaired GLP-1 sensitivity (1.high-fat diet-fed type 2 diabetic, 2.antibiotic-treated/germ-free mice). Our data show that GLP-1 sensitivity relies on specific pattern of intestinal clock gene expression and specific gut bacteria. This new statement opens opportunities to treat diabetic patient with GLP-1-based therapies by using on a possible pre/probiotic co-treatment to improve the time-dependent efficiency of these therapies.

## Diurnal oscillations in gut bacterial load and composition eclipse seasonal and lifetime dynamics in wild meerkats.
 15.10.2021, _A Risely, K Wilhelm, T Clutton-Brock, MB Manser, S Sommer_


Circadian rhythms in gut microbiota composition are crucial for metabolic function, yet the extent to which they govern microbial dynamics compared to seasonal and lifetime processes remains unknown. Here, we investigate gut bacterial dynamics in wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) over a 20-year period to compare diurnal, seasonal, and lifetime processes in concert, applying ratios of absolute abundance. We found that diurnal oscillations in bacterial load and composition eclipsed seasonal and lifetime dynamics. Diurnal oscillations were characterised by a peak in Clostridium abundance at dawn, were associated with temperature-constrained foraging schedules, and did not decay with age. Some genera exhibited seasonal fluctuations, whilst others developed with age, although we found little support for microbial senescence in very old meerkats. Strong microbial circadian rhythms in this species may reflect the extreme daily temperature fluctuations typical of arid-zone climates. Our findings demonstrate that accounting for circadian rhythms is essential for future gut microbiome research.

## Diet diversity and environment determine the intestinal microbiome and bacterial pathogen load of fire salamanders.

Diverse communities of symbiotic microbes inhabit the digestive systems of vertebrates and play a crucial role in animal health, and host diet plays a major role in shaping the composition and diversity of these communities. Here, we characterized diet and gut microbiome of fire salamander populations from three Belgian forests. We carried out DNA metabarcoding on fecal samples, targeting eukaryotic 18S rRNA of potential dietary prey items, and bacterial 16S rRNA of the concomitant gut microbiome. Our results demonstrated an abundance of soft-bodied prey in the diet of fire salamanders, and a significant difference in the diet composition between males and females. This sex-dependent effect on diet was also reflected in the gut microbiome diversity, which is higher in males than female animals. Proximity to human activities was associated with increased intestinal pathogen loads. Collectively, the data supports a relationship between diet, environment and intestinal microbiome in fire salamanders, with potential health implications.

## Does probiotics work for bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
 14.10.2021, _Y Han, QL Ren_


The different Lactobacillus strains of probiotics have been applied to the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis. The experimental data demonstrated that it works well via reducing the number of harmful bacteria, maintaining the acidic microenvironment, inhibiting the immune response, and so on, to restore the vaginal microecology. However, the clinical data indicated that it is not sufficient to support the use of probiotics in the intervention of vulvovaginal candidiasis rather than bacterial vaginosis. Hunting for novel probiotic strains and uncovering the precise mechanism of probiotics, especially with the new concept gut-vagina axis, to maintain the homeostasis of vaginal microbiota should be a great challenge in the future.

The biopreservation strategy allows extending the shelf life and food safety through the use of indigenous or controlled microbiota and their antimicrobial compounds. The aim of this work was to characterize an inhibitory substance with bacteriocin-like activity (Sak-59) produced by the potentially probiotic L. sakei strain from artisanal traditional Kazakh horse meat product Kazy. The maximum production of Sak-59 occurred at the stationary phase of the L. sakei growth. Sak-59 showed inhibitory activity against gram-positive meat spoilage bacteria strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and pathogenic gram-negative bacteria strains of Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli, but not against the tested Lactobacilli strains. Sak-59 activity, as measured by diffusion assay in agar wells, was completely suppressed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and remained stable after treatment with α-amylase and lipase, indicating that Sak-59 is a peptide and most likely not glycosylated or lipidated. It was concluded that Sak-59 is a potential new bacteriocin with a characteristic activity spectrum, which can be useful in the food and feed industries.

## Probiotic Interventions Alleviate Food Allergy Symptoms Correlated With Cesarean Section: A Murine Model.
 16.10.2021, _BY Jin, Z Li, YN Xia, LX Li, ZX Zhao, XY Li, Y Li, B Li, RC Zhou, SC Fu, SY Li, YQ Li_


Delivery by cesarean section (CS) is linked to an increased incidence of food allergies in children and affects early gut microbiota colonization. Furthermore, emerging evidence has connected disordered intestinal microbiota to food allergies. Here, we investigated the impact of CS on a rat model for food allergy to ovalbumin (OVA). Rats delivered by CS were found to be more responsive to OVA sensitization than vaginally born ones, displaying a greater reduction in rectal temperature upon challenge, worse diarrhea, and higher levels of OVA-specific antibodies and histamine. 16S rRNA sequencing of feces revealed reduced levels of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the CS rats. Preventative supplementation with a probiotic combination containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium could protect CS rats against an allergic response to OVA, indicating that the microbiota dysbiosis contributes to CS-related response. Additionally, probiotic intervention early in life might help to rebuild aberrant Th2 responses and tight junction proteins, both of which have been linked to CS-related high allergic reactions. Taken together, this study shows that disordered intestinal microbiota plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of food allergy mediated by CS. More importantly, interventions that modulate the microbiota composition in early life are therapeutically relevant for CS-related food allergies.

## Charting the complexity of the activated sludge microbiome through a hybrid sequencing strategy.
 15.10.2021, _L Liu, Y Wang, Y Yang, D Wang, SH Cheng, C Zheng, T Zhang_


Long-read sequencing has shown its tremendous potential to address genome assembly challenges, e.g., achieving the first telomere-to-telomere assembly of a gapless human chromosome. However, many issues remain unresolved when leveraging error-prone long reads to characterize high-complexity metagenomes, for instance, complete/high-quality genome reconstruction from highly complex systems.

## PBK model-based prediction of intestinal microbial and host metabolism of zearalenone and consequences for its estrogenicity.
 14.10.2021, _DM Mendez-Catala, Q Wang, IMCM Rietjens_


The aim of the present study was to develop physiologically-based kinetic (PBK) models for rat and human that include intestinal microbial and hepatic metabolism of zearalenone (ZEN) in order to predict systemic concentrations of ZEN and to obtain insight in the contribution of metabolism by the intestinal microbiota to the overall metabolism of ZEN.
