 23.02.2024, _G Conte, SA Pacino, S Urso, D Greiling, P Caponnetto, E Pedullà, L Generali, U Consolo, V Checchi, S Gospodaru, G Bordeniuc, V Fala, J Kowalski, M Nowak, R Górska, A Amaliya, I Chapple, M Milward, R Maclure, GM Nardi, R Polosa_


Although the detrimental effects of conventional combustible cigarettes on oral health and dental esthetics are well known, there is limited information about the long-term impact of combustion-free nicotine alternatives (C-F NA) such as e-cigarettes or heated tobacco products.

## Inter-epitope spacer variation within polytopic L2-based human papillomavirus antigens affects immunogenicity.

The human papillomavirus minor capsid protein L2 is being extensively explored in pre-clinical studies as an attractive vaccine antigen capable of inducing broad-spectrum prophylactic antibody responses. Recently, we have developed two HPV vaccine antigens - PANHPVAX and CUT-PANHPVAX- both based on heptameric nanoparticle antigens displaying polytopes of the L2 major cross-neutralizing epitopes of eight mucosal and twelve cutaneous HPV types, respectively. Prompted by the variable neutralizing antibody responses against some of the HPV types targeted by the antigens observed in previous studies, here we investigated the influence on immunogenicity of six distinct glycine-proline spacers inserted upstream to a specific L2 epitope. We show that spacer variants differentially influence antigen immunogenicity in a mouse model, with the antigen constructs M8merV6 and C12merV6 displaying a superior ability in the induction of neutralizing antibodies as determined by pseudovirus-based neutralization assays (PBNAs). L2-peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assessments determined the total anti-L2 antibody level for each antigen variant, showing for the majority of sera a correlation with their repective neutralizing antibody level. Surface Plasmon Resonance revealed that L2 epitope-specific, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) display distinct avidities to different antigen spacer variants. Furthermore, mAb affinity toward individual spacer variants was well correlated with their neutralizing antibody induction capacity, indicating that the mAb affinity assay predicts L2-based antigen immunogenicity. These observations provide insights on the development and optimization of L2-based HPV vaccines.

## Cardiac rehabilitation for children and young people (CardioActive): protocol for a single-blind randomised feasibility and acceptability study of a centre-based cardiac rehabilitation programme versus usual care in 11-16 years with heart conditions.
 24.02.2024, _L Capobianco, M Hann, E McManus, S Peters, PJ Doherty, G Ciotti, J Murray, A Wells_


Congenital heart conditions are among the most common non-communicable diseases in children and young people (CYP), affecting 13.9 million CYP globally. While survival rates are increasing, support for young people adjusting to life with a heart condition is lacking. Furthermore, one in three CYP with heart conditions also experiences anxiety, depression or adjustment disorder, for which little support is offered. While adults are offered cardiac rehabilitation (CR) to support their mental and physical health, this is not offered for CYP.One way to overcome this is to evaluate a CR programme comprising exercise with mental health support (CardioActive; CA) for CYP with heart conditions. The exercise and mental health components are informed by the metacognitive model, which has been shown to be effective in treating anxiety and depression in CYP and associated with improving psychological outcomes in adult CR.
