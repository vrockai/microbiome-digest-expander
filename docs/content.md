_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Existing and Developing Preclinical Models for Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Related Cutaneous Neurofibromas.
 18.06.2023, _V Staedtke, P Topilko, LQ Le, K Grimes, DA Largaespada, RL Cagan, MR Steensma, A Stemmer-Rachamimov, JO Blakeley, SD Rhodes, I Ly, CG Romo, SY Lee, E Serra_


Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is caused by a nonfunctional copy of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene that predisposes patients to the development of cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), the skin tumor that is the hallmark of this condition. Innumerable benign cNFs, each appearing by an independent somatic inactivation of the remaining functional NF1 allele, form in nearly all patients with NF1. One of the limitations in developing a treatment for cNFs is an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and limitations in experimental modeling. Recent advances in preclinical in vitro and in vivo modeling have substantially enhanced our understanding of cNF biology and created unprecedented opportunities for therapeutic discovery. We discuss the current state of cNF preclinical in vitro and in vivo model systems, including two- and three-dimensional cell cultures, organoids, genetically engineered mice, patient-derived xenografts, and porcine models. We highlight the models' relationship to human cNFs and how they can be used to gain insight into cNF development and therapeutic discovery.

## Determination of Tr1 cell populations correlating with distinct activation states in acute IAV infection.
 15.06.2023, _CA Abbott, EL Freimayer, TS Tyllis, TS Norton, M Alsharifi, A H S Heng, SM Pederson, Z Qu, M Armstrong, GR Hill, SR McColl, I Comerford_


Type I regulatory (Tr1) cells are defined as FOXP3-IL-10-secreting CD4+ T cells that contribute to immune suppression and typically express the markers LAG-3 and CD49b and other co-inhibitory receptors. These cells have not been studied in detail the context of the resolution of acute infection in the lung. Here, we identify FOXP3-IL-10+ CD4+ T cells transiently accumulating in the lung parenchyma during resolution of the response to sublethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice. These cells were dependent on IL-27Rα, which was required for timely recovery from IAV-induced weight loss. LAG-3 and CD49b were not generally co-expressed by FOXP3- IL-10+ CD4+ T cells in this model and four populations of these cells based on LAG-3 and CD49b co-expression were apparent (LAG-3-CD49b- [DN], LAG-3+CD49b+ [DP], LAG-3+CD49b- [LAG-3+], LAG-3-CD49b+ [CD49b+]). However, each population exhibited suppressive potential consistent with the definition of Tr1 cells. Notably, differences between these populations of Tr1 cells were apparent including differential dependence on IL-10 to mediate suppression and expression of markers indicative of different activation states and terminal differentiation. Sort-transfer experiments indicated that LAG-3+ Tr1 cells exhibited the capacity to convert to DN and DP Tr1 cells, indicative of plasticity between these populations. Together, these data determine the features and suppressive potential of Tr1 cells in the resolution of IAV infection and identify four populations delineated by LAG-3 and CD49b, which likely correspond to different Tr1 cell activation states.

## Obesity: Policy and Practice Recommendations for High-Risk Populations Influenced by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
 22.12.2022, _KN Robinson, DA Saber_


_Humans, United States, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Pandemics, Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype, Obesity, Policy_
Obesity has been linked to higher morbidity and mortality in those that contract novel viruses, such as H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. Loss of life and the high cost of obesity highlight the need to focus on preventative measures. The state of Maine (United States) is profiled as a rural state with high rates of obesity and low health literacy that benefits from programs to improve health. However, more multidirectional efforts are needed. Four recommendations for building a healthier, more resilient patient population are discussed here: (i) state incentives and subsidies, (ii) employers to incentivize healthy living, (iii) federal incentives and initiatives, and (iv) personal responsibility for health and wellness.

## Guild and Niche Determination Enable Targeted Alteration of the Microbiome.
 30.05.2023, _O Moyne, M Al-Bassam, C Lieng, D Thiruppathy, GJ Norton, M Kumar, E Haddad, LS Zaramela, K Zengler_


Microbiome science has greatly contributed to our understanding of microbial life and its essential roles for the environment and human health 1-5 . However, the nature of microbial interactions and how microbial communities respond to perturbations remains poorly understood, resulting in an often descriptive and correlation-based approach to microbiome research 6-8 . Achieving causal and predictive microbiome science would require direct functional measurements in complex communities to better understand the metabolic role of each member and its interactions with others. In this study we present a new approach that integrates transcription and translation measurements to predict competition and substrate preferences within microbial communities, consequently enabling the selective manipulation of the microbiome. By performing metatranscriptomic (metaRNA-Seq) and metatranslatomic (metaRibo-Seq) analysis in complex samples, we classified microbes into functional groups (i.e. guilds) and demonstrated that members of the same guild are competitors. Furthermore, we predicted preferred substrates based on importer proteins, which specifically benefited selected microbes in the community (i.e. their niche) and simultaneously impaired their competitors. We demonstrated the scalability of microbial guild and niche determination to natural samples and its ability to successfully manipulate microorganisms in complex microbiomes. Thus, the approach enhances the design of pre- and probiotic interventions to selectively alter members within microbial communities, advances our understanding of microbial interactions, and paves the way for establishing causality in microbiome science.

Currently, infertility affects 8-12% of reproductive age couples worldwide, a problem that also affects women suffering from recurrent implantation failure (RIF). RIF is a complex condition resulting from many physiological and molecular mechanisms involving dynamic endometrium-blastocyst interaction. The most important are the endometrial receptivity process, decidualization, trophoblast invasion, and blastocyst nesting. Although the exact multifactorial pathogenesis of RIF remains unclear, many studies have suggested the association between hormone level imbalance, disturbances of angiogenic and immunomodulatory factors, certain genetic polymorphisms, and occurrence of RIF. These studies were performed in quite small groups. Additionally, the results are inconsistent between ethnicities. The present review briefly summarizes the importance of factors involved in RIF development that could also serve as diagnostic determinants. Moreover, our review could constitute part of a new platform for discovery of novel diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for RIF.

## Therapy of replenishing and regulating for manic episode in bipolar disorder: study protocol for a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.
 16.06.2023, _Y Yang, Y Haining, J Hongxiao, N Yanzhe, W Di, Z Lei, Y Kaijuan, G Yumeng, W Fei, S Weishuang, C Pei_


_Humans, Adolescent, Bipolar Disorder, Mania, Quality of Life, Prospective Studies, Double-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic_
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and recurrent disorder characterized by biphasic mood episodes of mania or hypomania and depression. It affects more than 1% of the global population and is a leading cause of disability in young people. Currently available treatments for BD are still fairly limited in terms of efficacy, with high rates of non-adherence, non-response, and undesirable side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history and rich experience in stabilizing mania and improving quality of life. Aiming at rebalancing and in BD, therapy of replenishing and regulating (RYRY therapy) has been in clinical use for years in China. The present prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of RYRY therapy for bipolar mania and its possible mechanism from the point of regulating gut microbiota and anti-inflammation. A total of 60 eligible participants will be recruited from Beijing Anding Hospital. They will be randomized to either the study group or the control group in a ratio of 1∶1. Participants allocated to the study group will receive RYRY granule, while placebo granule will be applied in the control group. Participants in both groups will be prescribed conventional therapy for manic episode in BD. Four scheduled visits will be conducted over 4 weeks. Outcome measurements include Young Mania Rating Scale, TCM Symptom Pattern Rating Scale, Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale, levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α and the gut microbial community profile of stool samples. Safety outcomes and adverse events will also be recorded. In this study, we set a number of scientific and objective assessments to evaluate the efficacy of RYRY therapy and study into its possible mechanism, hopefully offering clinicians an alternative approach to BD.

## Investigating the effects of conventional and unconventional edible parts of red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) on target bacterial groups and metabolic activity of human colonic microbiota to produce novel and sustainable prebiotic ingredients.
 18.06.2023, _SPA de Oliveira, TMR de Albuquerque, NML Massa, NPA Rodrigues, KB Sampaio, HMA do Nascimento, M Dos Santos Lima, ML da Conceição, EL de Souza_


This study investigated the effects of freeze-dried red beet root (FDBR) and freeze-dried red beet stem and leaves (FDBSL) on target bacterial groups and metabolic activity of human colonic microbiota in vitro. The capability of FDBR and FDBSL to cause alterations in the relative abundance of different selected bacterial groups found as part of human intestinal microbiota, as well as in pH values, sugar, short-chain fatty acid, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant capacity were evaluated during 48 h of in vitro colonic fermentation. FDBR and FDBSL were submitted to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and freeze-dried prior to use in colonic fermentation. FDBR and FDBSL overall increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp./Enterococcus spp. (3.64-7.60%) and Bifidobacterium spp. (2.76-5.78%) and decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroides spp./Prevotella spp. (9.56-4.18%), Clostridium histolyticum (1.62-1.15%), and Eubacterium rectale/Clostridium coccoides (2.33-1.49%) during 48 h of colonic fermentation. FDBR and FDBSL had high positive prebiotic indexes (&gt;3.61) during colonic fermentation, indicating selective stimulatory effects on beneficial intestinal bacterial groups. FDBR and FDBSL increased the metabolic activity of human colonic microbiota, evidenced by decreased pH, sugar consumption, short-chain fatty acid production, alterations in phenolic compound contents, and maintenance of high antioxidant capacity during colonic fermentation. The results indicate that FDBR and FDBSL could induce beneficial alterations in the composition and metabolic activity of human intestinal microbiota, as well as that conventional and unconventional red beet edible parts are candidates to use as novel and sustainable prebiotic ingredients.

## Colloidal gold based immunochromatographic detection of Mycoplasmopsis synoviae infection and its prevalence in avian species of Karachi, Pakistan.
 17.06.2023, _N Rehman, U Ejaz, A Siraj, S Liaquat, M Sohail, TA Khan, SF Moin, A Ahmad_


Avian mycoplasmosis is an infection that commonly prevails in birds, particularly in poultry chickens. Among mycoplasmosis causing organisms, Mycoplasmopsis synoviae is a predominant and lethal pathogen to the aves. Considering the increased incidence of infections by M. synoviae, the prevalence of M. synoviae was deduced in poultry chickens and fancy birds of Karachi region. The lungs and tracheal samples from chicken and dead fancy birds and swab samples from live fancy birds were collected and investigated by amplifying 16 s rRNA gene of M. synoviae. Biochemical characteristics of M. synoviae was also evaluated. Furthermore, surface-associated membrane proteins, that represent key antigens for diagnosis of M. synoviae infection was extracted by Triton X- 114 method. Results showed that M. synoviae was detected more frequently in lungs than in trachea, that could be due to its invasion capacity and tissue affinity. SDS PAGE analysis of extracted membrane proteins showed two prominent hydrophobic proteins of different molecular mass including proteins of 150 and 50 kDa. Protein of 150 kDa was purified by size exclusion chromatography and it exhibited agglutinogen activity. Purified protein was used in the development of one-step immunochromatographic (ICT) assay for the detection of antibodies against M. synoviae using gold nanoparticles coated with polyclonal antibodies. Low levels of antibodies were detected by the developed ICT kit, which has 88% sensitivity with 92% specificity.

## Gut microbiota and cognitive development in infant mice: Quantity and source of potable water.
 16.06.2023, _CS Kim, DM Shin_


_Animals, Mice, Drinking Water, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Dehydration, Cognition, Cognitive Dysfunction, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes_
Not only the water quantity consumed but also the source of drinking water has been considered for their health benefits, but there is limited evidence. We aimed to determine whether the amount and type of drinking water affect physiological and biological functions, including brain function, by confirming how it affects gut microbiota which has an important regulatory role in host physiology. Three-week-old infant mice were subjected to 1) a water restriction experiment (control group, ad libitum consumption of distilled water; dehydration group, time-limited access to distilled water [15 min/day]) and 2) different water source experiment (distilled water, purified water, spring water, and tap water groups). The gut microbiota and cognitive development were analyzed using the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing method and the Barnes maze, respectively. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) changed depending on age (juveniles vs. infants). Insufficient water intake reversed these developmental changes, showing that the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the F/B ratio in dehydrated juvenile mice were similar to those in normal infant mice. Additionally, clustering analysis revealed no significant differences in the intestinal flora in the mice from the different drinking water sources; however, dehydration significantly altered the composition of the genera compared to the other water source groups wherein water was provided ad libitum. Moreover, cognitive development was significantly disrupted by insufficient water intake, although the type of drinking water had no significant influence. Cognitive decline, measured by relative latency, was positively associated with the relative abundance of unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae that were in significantly high relative abundance in the dehydration group. These results suggest that the water quantity consumed, rather than the mineral content of drinking water, is imperative for shaping the early gut microbiota associated with cognitive development during infancy.

## Globally consistent response of plant microbiome diversity across hosts and continents to soil nutrients and herbivores.

_Herbivory, Biomass, Microbiota, Nutrients, Soil_
All multicellular organisms host a diverse microbiome composed of microbial pathogens, mutualists, and commensals, and changes in microbiome diversity or composition can alter host fitness and function. Nonetheless, we lack a general understanding of the drivers of microbiome diversity, in part because it is regulated by concurrent processes spanning scales from global to local. Global-scale environmental gradients can determine variation in microbiome diversity among sites, however an individual host's microbiome also may reflect its local micro-environment. We fill this knowledge gap by experimentally manipulating two potential mediators of plant microbiome diversity (soil nutrient supply and herbivore density) at 23 grassland sites spanning global-scale gradients in soil nutrients, climate, and plant biomass. Here we show that leaf-scale microbiome diversity in unmanipulated plots depended on the total microbiome diversity at each site, which was highest at sites with high soil nutrients and plant biomass. We also found that experimentally adding soil nutrients and excluding herbivores produced concordant results across sites, increasing microbiome diversity by increasing plant biomass, which created a shaded microclimate. This demonstration of consistent responses of microbiome diversity across a wide range of host species and environmental conditions suggests the possibility of a general, predictive understanding of microbiome diversity.

Safety training is integral to modern safety management systems. However, what is trained in the classroom is not always adopted and applied in the workplace, creating the training transfer problem. Taking an alternative ontological stance, the aims of this study were to conceptualize this problem as one of 'fit' between what is trained and the contextual factors in the work environment of the adopting organization.

This study investigated the effects of freeze-dried red beet root (FDBR) and freeze-dried red beet stem and leaves (FDBSL) on target bacterial groups and metabolic activity of human colonic microbiota in vitro. The capability of FDBR and FDBSL to cause alterations in the relative abundance of different selected bacterial groups found as part of human intestinal microbiota, as well as in pH values, sugar, short-chain fatty acid, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant capacity were evaluated during 48 h of in vitro colonic fermentation. FDBR and FDBSL were submitted to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and freeze-dried prior to use in colonic fermentation. FDBR and FDBSL overall increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp./Enterococcus spp. (3.64-7.60%) and Bifidobacterium spp. (2.76-5.78%) and decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroides spp./Prevotella spp. (9.56-4.18%), Clostridium histolyticum (1.62-1.15%), and Eubacterium rectale/Clostridium coccoides (2.33-1.49%) during 48 h of colonic fermentation. FDBR and FDBSL had high positive prebiotic indexes (&gt;3.61) during colonic fermentation, indicating selective stimulatory effects on beneficial intestinal bacterial groups. FDBR and FDBSL increased the metabolic activity of human colonic microbiota, evidenced by decreased pH, sugar consumption, short-chain fatty acid production, alterations in phenolic compound contents, and maintenance of high antioxidant capacity during colonic fermentation. The results indicate that FDBR and FDBSL could induce beneficial alterations in the composition and metabolic activity of human intestinal microbiota, as well as that conventional and unconventional red beet edible parts are candidates to use as novel and sustainable prebiotic ingredients.

Despite host-fungal symbiotic interactions being ubiquitous in all ecosystems, understanding how symbiosis has shaped the ecology and evolution of fungal spores that are involved in dispersal and colonization of their hosts has been ignored in life-history studies. We assembled a spore morphology database covering over 26,000 species of free-living to symbiotic fungi of plants, insects and humans and found more than eight orders of variation in spore size. Evolutionary transitions in symbiotic status correlated with shifts in spore size, but the strength of this effect varied widely among phyla. Symbiotic status explained more variation than climatic variables in the current distribution of spore sizes of plant-associated fungi at a global scale while the dispersal potential of their spores is more restricted compared to free-living fungi. Our work advances life-history theory by highlighting how the interaction between symbiosis and offspring morphology shapes the reproductive and dispersal strategies among living forms.

## Impact of physical and mental fatigue on construction workers' unsafe behavior based on physiological measurement.
 18.06.2023, _Z Zhang, T Xiang, H Guo, L Ma, Z Guan, Y Fang_


Construction worker fatigue is an important factor leading to unsafe behavior, a major cause of construction accidents. Uncovering the impact mechanism of fatigue on workers' unsafe behavior can prevent construction accidents. However, it is difficult to effectively measure workers' fatigue onsite and analyze the impact of worker fatigue on their unsafe behavior.

## 5300-Year-old soil carbon is less primed than young soil organic matter.
 22.01.2023, _J Su, H Zhang, X Han, R Lv, L Liu, Y Jiang, H Li, Y Kuzyakov, C Wei_


_Soil, Carbon, Nitrogen, Soil Microbiology, Glucose_
Soils harbor more than three times as much carbon (C) as the atmosphere, a large fraction of which (stable organic matter) serves as the most important global C reservoir due to its long residence time. Litter and root inputs bring fresh organic matter (FOM) into the soil and accelerate the turnover of stable C pools, and this phenomenon is termed the "priming effect" (PE). Compared with knowledge about labile soil C pools, very little is known about the vulnerability of stable C to priming. Using two soils that substantially differed in age (500 and 5300 years before present) and in the degree of chemical recalcitrance and physical protection of soil organic matter (SOM), we showed that leaf litter amendment primed 264% more organic C from the young SOM than from the old soil with very stable C. Hierarchical partitioning analysis confirmed that SOM stability, reflected mainly by available C and aggregate protection of SOM, is the most important predictor of leaf litter-induced PE. The addition of complex FOM (i.e., leaf litter) caused a higher bacterial oligotroph/copiotroph (K-/r-strategists) ratio, leading to a PE that was 583% and 126% greater than when simple FOM (i.e., glucose) was added to the young and old soils, respectively. This implies that the PE intensity depends on the chemical similarity between the primer (here FOM) and SOM. Nitrogen (N) mining existed when N and simple FOM were added (i.e., Glucose+N), and N addition raised the leaf litter-induced PE in the old soil that had low N availability, which was well explained by the microbial stoichiometry. In conclusion, the PE induced by FOM inputs strongly decreases with increasing SOM stability. However, the contribution of stable SOM to CO2 efflux cannot be disregarded due to its huge pool size.

## Divergence in cell cycle progression is associated with shifted phenology in a multivoltine moth: the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis.
 15.06.2023, _Q Xia, C Chen, EB Dopman, DA Hahn_


_Animals, Moths, Zea mays, Larva, Diapause, Cell Division_
Evolutionary change in diapause timing can be an adaptive response to changing seasonality, and even result in ecological speciation. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating shifts in diapause timing remain poorly understood. One of the hallmarks of diapause is a massive slowdown in the cell cycle of target organs such as the brain and primordial imaginal structures, and resumption of cell cycle proliferation is an indication of diapause termination and resumption of development. Characterizing cell cycle parameters between lineages differing in diapause life history timing may help identify molecular mechanisms associated with alterations of diapause timing. We tested the extent to which progression of the cell cycle differs across diapause between two genetically distinct European corn borer strains that differ in their seasonal diapause timing. We show the cell cycle slows down during larval diapause with a significant decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase. Brain-subesophageal complex cells slow primarily in G0/G1 phase whereas most wing disc cells are in G2 phase. Diapausing larvae of the earlier emerging, bivoltine E-strain (BE) suppressed cell cycle progression less than the later emerging, univoltine Z-strain (UZ) individuals, with a greater proportion of cells in S phase across both tissues during diapause. Additionally, resumption of cell cycle proliferation occurred earlier in the BE strain than in the UZ strain after exposure to diapause-terminating conditions. We propose that regulation of cell cycle progression rates ultimately drives differences in larval diapause termination, and adult emergence timing, between early- and late-emerging European corn borer strains.

## Trauma bypass performed by vascular surgeons demonstrate excellent long-term outcomes and limb preservation.
 18.06.2023, _M Harutyunyan, JC Hnath, X Jacobson, J Le, MD Shah, J Kleene, RC Darling_


Long-term outcomes in civilian trauma patients requiring upper or lower extremity revascularization is poorly studied secondary to limitations of certain large databases and the nature of the patients in this specific vascular subset. This study reports on the experience and outcomes of a Level 1 trauma center that serves both an urban and a large rural population over a 20-year period to identify bypass outcomes and surveillance protocols.

The majority of the current regulatory practices for routine monitoring of beach water quality rely on the culture-based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) to develop criteria for promoting the general public's health. To address the limitations of culture methods and the arguable reliability of FIB in indicating health risks, we developed a Nanopore metagenomic sequencing-based viable cell absolute quantification workflow to rapidly and accurately estimate a broad range of microbes in beach waters by a combination of propidium monoazide (PMA) and cellular spike-ins. Using the simple synthetic bacterial communities mixed with viable and heat-killed cells, we observed near-complete relic DNA removal by PMA with minimal disturbance to the composition of viable cells, demonstrating the feasibility of PMA treatment in profiling viable cells by Nanopore sequencing. On a simple mock community comprised of 15 prokaryotic species, our results showed high accordance between the expected and estimated concentrations, suggesting the accuracy of our method in absolute quantification. We then further assessed the accuracy of our method for counting viable Escherichia coli and Vibrio spp. in beach waters by comparing to culture-based method, which were also in high agreement. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 1 Gb sequences obtained within 2 h would be sufficient to quantify a species having a concentration of ≥ 10 cells/mL in beach waters. Using our viability-resolved quantification workflow to assess the microbial risk of the beach water, we conducted (1) screening-level quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to investigate human illness risk and site-specific risk patterns that might guide risk management efforts and (2) metagenomics-based resistome risk assessment to evaluate another layer of risk caused by difficult illness treatment due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In summary, our metagenomic workflow for the rapid absolute quantification of viable bacteria demonstrated its great potential in paving new avenues toward holistic microbial risk assessment.

## ResFinderFG v2.0: a database of antibiotic resistance genes obtained by functional metagenomics.
 19.05.2023, _R Gschwind, S Ugarcina Perovic, M Weiss, M Petitjean, J Lao, LP Coelho, E Ruppé_


Metagenomics can be used to monitor the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). ARGs found in databases such as ResFinder and CARD primarily originate from culturable and pathogenic bacteria, while ARGs from non-culturable and non-pathogenic bacteria remain understudied. Functional metagenomics is based on phenotypic gene selection and can identify ARGs from non-culturable bacteria with a potentially low identity shared with known ARGs. In 2016, the ResFinderFG v1.0 database was created to collect ARGs from functional metagenomics studies. Here, we present the second version of the database, ResFinderFG v2.0, which is available on the Center of Genomic Epidemiology web server (https://cge.food.dtu.dk/services/ResFinderFG/). It comprises 3913 ARGs identified by functional metagenomics from 50 carefully curated datasets. We assessed its potential to detect ARGs in comparison to other popular databases in gut, soil and water (marine + freshwater) Global Microbial Gene Catalogues (https://gmgc.embl.de). ResFinderFG v2.0 allowed for the detection of ARGs that were not detected using other databases. These included ARGs conferring resistance to beta-lactams, cycline, phenicol, glycopeptide/cycloserine and trimethoprim/sulfonamide. Thus, ResFinderFG v2.0 can be used to identify ARGs differing from those found in conventional databases and therefore improve the description of resistomes.

## Achieving pan-microbiome biological insights via the dbBact knowledge base.
 16.06.2023, _A Amir, E Ozel, Y Haberman, N Shental_


16S rRNA amplicon sequencing provides a relatively inexpensive culture-independent method for studying microbial communities. Although thousands of such studies have examined diverse habitats, it is difficult for researchers to use this vast trove of experiments when interpreting their own findings in a broader context. To bridge this gap, we introduce dbBact - a novel pan-microbiome resource. dbBact combines manually curated information from studies across diverse habitats, creating a collaborative central repository of 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which are assigned multiple ontology-based terms. To date dbBact contains information from more than 1000 studies, which include 1500000 associations between 360000 ASVs and 6500 ontology terms. Importantly, dbBact offers a set of computational tools allowing users to easily query their own datasets against the database. To demonstrate how dbBact augments standard microbiome analysis we selected 16 published papers, and reanalyzed their data via dbBact. We uncovered novel inter-host similarities, potential intra-host sources of bacteria, commonalities across different diseases and lower host-specificity in disease-associated bacteria. We also demonstrate the ability to detect environmental sources, reagent-borne contaminants, and identify potential cross-sample contaminations. These analyses demonstrate how combining information across multiple studies and over diverse habitats leads to better understanding of underlying biological processes.
