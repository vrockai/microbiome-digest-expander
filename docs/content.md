Dental biofilm present on the tooth surface is associated with oral diseases, such as dental caries and periodontal disease. Because bacterial numbers rapidly increase in saliva during sleep, oral care before sleeping is recommended for the prevention of chronic oral diseases. However, temporal circadian changes in the quantity and quality of dental biofilms are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of sleeping on dental biofilm amounts and compositions by using an in situ model. The use of this in situ model enabled us to investigate dental biofilm formed in the oral cavity and to perform a quantitative analysis. Subjects began wearing oral splints in the morning or before sleeping, and biofilm samples were collected at 8, 16, and 24 h after the subjects began wearing oral splints; these samples were then used in various experiments. No significant changes in the numbers of biofilm-forming bacteria were caused by sleep. However, the relative abundances of genera related to periodontitis (i.e., Fusobacterium and Prevotella) increased after awakening. In conclusion, the numbers of biofilm-forming bacteria were not affected by sleep, and the abundances of obligate anaerobes increased after sleep. This research may aid in defining efficacious preventive oral care.

## Dysbiosis of rat vagina is efficiently rescued by the vaginal microbiota transplantation or probiotic combination: Vaginal microbiota transplantation rescues dysbiosis in rat vagina.

Vaginal dysbiosis is characterized by the disturbed vaginal microbiota and associated with various gynecological diseases, and it is an urgent need for the development of effective agent due to its high recurrence. In the present study, the vaginal dysbiosis model was developed to study the positive effect of the vaginal microbiota transplantation (VMT) or probiotic combination (PC, containing Lactobacillus helveticus, L. crispatus, L. acidophilus, L. gasseri, and L. salivarius) on vaginal dysbiosis. Our results indicated that VMT or PC significantly reduced the introducing bacteria-induced inflammation (infiltrations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) in uterine wall, the enrichment of the proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1β and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α] in vaginal tissue, and restored the disturbed vaginal microbiota to normal level (increasing numbers of Lactobacillus and decreasing numbers of Enterobacter and Enterococcus), by which it should be beneficial for avoiding the recurrence of vaginal dysbiosis. Therefore, VMT or PC might be an effective agent for the treatment of the bacterial-induced vaginosis.
