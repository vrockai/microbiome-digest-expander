## Differences in Gut Microbiome Composition Between Sympatric Wild and Allopatric Laboratory Populations of Omnivorous Cockroaches.
 17.08.2021, _KA Tinker, EA Ottesen_


Gut microbiome composition is determined by a complex interplay of host genetics, founder's effects, and host environment. We are using omnivorous cockroaches as a model to disentangle the relative contribution of these factors. Cockroaches are a useful model for host-gut microbiome interactions due to their rich hindgut microbial community, omnivorous diet, and gregarious lifestyle. In this study, we used 16S rRNA sequencing to compare the gut microbial community of allopatric laboratory populations of Periplaneta americana as well as sympatric, wild-caught populations of P. americana and Periplaneta fuliginosa, before and after a 14 day period of acclimatization to a common laboratory environment. Our results showed that the gut microbiome of cockroaches differed by both species and rearing environment. The gut microbiome from the sympatric population of wild-captured cockroaches showed strong separation based on host species. Laboratory-reared and wild-captured cockroaches from the same species also exhibited distinct gut microbiome profiles. Each group of cockroaches had a unique signature of differentially abundant uncharacterized taxa still present after laboratory cultivation. Transition to the laboratory environment resulted in decreased microbiome diversity for both species of wild-caught insects. Interestingly, although laboratory cultivation resulted in similar losses of microbial diversity for both species, it did not cause the gut microbiome of those species to become substantially more similar. These results demonstrate how competing factors impact the gut microbiome and highlight the need for a greater understanding of host-microbiome interactions.

Fungi of the genus Mortierella occur ubiquitously in soils where they play pivotal roles in carbon cycling, xenobiont degradation, and promoting plant growth. These important fungi are, however, threatened by micropredators such as fungivorous nematodes, and yet little is known about their protective tactics. We report that Mortierella verticillata NRRL 6337 harbors a bacterial endosymbiont that efficiently shields its host from nematode attacks with anthelmintic metabolites. Microscopic investigation and 16S ribosomal DNA analysis revealed that a previously overlooked bacterial symbiont belonging to the genus Mycoavidus dwells in M. verticillata hyphae. Metabolic profiling of the wild-type fungus and a symbiont-free strain obtained by antibiotic treatment as well as genome analyses revealed that highly cytotoxic macrolactones (CJ-12,950 and CJ-13,357, syn necroxime C and D), initially thought to be metabolites of the soil-inhabiting fungus, are actually biosynthesized by the endosymbiont. According to comparative genomics, the symbiont belongs to a new species (Candidatus Mycoavidus necroximicus) with 12% of its 2.2 Mb genome dedicated to natural product biosynthesis, including the modular polyketide-nonribosomal peptide synthetase for necroxime assembly. Using Caenorhabditis elegans and the fungivorous nematode Aphelenchus avenae as test strains, we show that necroximes exert highly potent anthelmintic activities. Effective host protection was demonstrated in cocultures of nematodes with symbiotic and chemically complemented aposymbiotic fungal strains. Image analysis and mathematical quantification of nematode movement enabled evaluation of the potency. Our work describes a relevant role for endofungal bacteria in protecting fungi against mycophagous nematodes.

## Intrinsically disordered protein biosensor tracks the physical-chemical effects of osmotic stress on cells.

Cell homeostasis is perturbed when dramatic shifts in the external environment cause the physical-chemical properties inside the cell to change. Experimental approaches for dynamically monitoring these intracellular effects are currently lacking. Here, we leverage the environmental sensitivity and structural plasticity of intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) to develop a FRET biosensor capable of monitoring rapid intracellular changes caused by osmotic stress. The biosensor, named SED1, utilizes the Arabidopsis intrinsically disordered AtLEA4-5 protein expressed in plants under water deficit. Computational modeling and in vitro studies reveal that SED1 is highly sensitive to macromolecular crowding. SED1 exhibits large and near-linear osmolarity-dependent changes in FRET inside living bacteria, yeast, plant, and human cells, demonstrating the broad utility of this tool for studying water-associated stress. This study demonstrates the remarkable ability of IDRs to sense the cellular environment across the tree of life and provides a blueprint for their use as environmentally-responsive molecular tools.
