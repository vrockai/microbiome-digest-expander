This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Effect of UV pretreatment on the source control of floR during subsequent biotreatment of florfenicol wastewater.
 12.01.2024, _Y Ding, H Feng, J Han, W Jiang, S Dong, H Cheng, M Wang, A Wang_


UV photolysis has been recommended as an alternative pretreatment method for the elimination of antibacterial activity of antibiotics against the indicator strain, but the pretreated antibiotic intermediates might not lose their potential to induce antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) proliferation during subsequent biotreatment processes. The presence of florfenicol (FLO) in wastewater seriously inhibits the metabolic performance of anaerobic sludge microorganisms, especially the positive correlation between UV irradiation doses and ATP content, while it did not significantly affect the organics utilization ability and protein biosynthetic process of aerobic microorganisms. After sufficient UV pretreatment, the relative abundances of floR from genomic or plasmid DNA in subsequent aerobic and anaerobic biotreatment processes both decreased by two orders of magnitude, maintained at the level of the groups without FLO selective pressure. Meanwhile, the abundances of floR under anaerobic condition were always lower than that under aerobic condition, suggesting that anaerobic biotreatment systems might be more suitable for the effective control of target ARGs. The higher abundance of floR in plasmid DNA than in genome also indicated that the potential transmission risk of mobile ARGs should not be ignored. In addition, the relative abundance of intI1 was positively correlated with floR in its corresponding genomic or plasmid DNA (p &lt; 0.05), which also increased the potential horizontal transfer risk of target ARGs. This study provides new insights into the effect of preferential UV photolysis as a pretreatment method for the enhancement of metabolic performance and source control of target ARGs in subsequent biotreatment processes. KEY POINTS: • Sufficient UV photolytic pretreatment efficiently controlled the abundance of floR • A synchronous decrease in abundance of intI1 reduced the risk of horizontal transfer • An appreciable abundance of floR in plasmid DNA was a potential source of total ARGs.

## Knickkopf (LmKnk) is required for chitin organization in the foregut of Locusta migratoria.
 12.01.2024, _RR Yu, JQ Duan, XM Zhao, M Abbas, YP Zhang, XK Shi, N Chen, JZ Zhang_


The foregut, located at the front of the digestive tract, serves a vital role in insects by storing and grinding food into small particles. The innermost layer of the foregut known as the chitinous intima, comes into direct contact with the food and acts as a protective barrier against abrasive particles. Knickkopf (Knk) is required for chitin organization in the chitinous exoskeleton, tracheae and wings. Despite its significance, little is known about the biological function of Knk in the foregut. In this study, we found that LmKnk was stably expressed in the foregut, and highly expressed before molting in Locusta migratoria. To ascertain the biological function of LmKnk in the foregut, we synthesized specific double-stranded LmKnk (dsLmKnk) and injected it into locusts. Our findings showed a significant decrease in the foregut size, along with reduced food intake and accumulation of residues in the foregut after dsLmKnk injection. Morphological observations revealed that newly formed intima became thinner and lacked chitin lamella. Furthermore, fluorescence immunohistochemistry revealed that LmKnk was located in the apical region of new intima and epithelial cells. Taken together, this study provides insights into the biological function of LmKnk in the foregut, and identifies the potential target gene for exploring biological pest management strategies.

## Short- and long-term effects of continuous compost amendment on soil microbiome community.

Organic amendment, and especially the use of composts, is a well-accepted sustainable agricultural practice. Compost increases soil carbon and microbial biomass, changes enzymatic activity, and enriches soil carbon and nitrogen stocks. However, relatively little is known about the immediate and long-term temporal dynamics of agricultural soil microbial communities following repeated compost applications. Our study was conducted at two field sites: Newe Ya'ar (NY, Mediterranean climate) and Gilat (G, semi-arid climate), both managed organically over 4 years under either conventional fertilization (0, zero compost) or three levels of compost amendment (20, 40 and 60 m3/ha or 2, 4, 6 L/m2). Microbial community dynamics in the soils was examined by high- and low-time-resolution analyses. Annual community composition in compost-amended soils was significantly affected by compost amendment levels in G (first, second and third years) and in NY (third year). Repeated sampling at high resolution (9-10 times over 1 year) showed that at both sites, compost application initially induced a strong shift in microbial communities, lasting for up to 1 month, followed by a milder response. Compost application significantly elevated alpha diversity at both sites, but differed in the compost-dose correlation effect. We demonstrate higher abundance of taxa putatively involved in organic decomposition and characterized compost-related indicator taxa and a compost-derived core microbiome at both sites. Overall, this study describes temporal changes in the ecology of soil microbiomes in response to compost vs. conventional fertilization.

## Efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection antagonization by rhACE2 ectodomain multimerized onto the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly.

Nanodecoy systems based on analogues of viral cellular receptors assembled onto fluid lipid-based membranes of nano/extravescicles are potential new tools to complement classic therapeutic or preventive antiviral approaches. The need for lipid-based membranes for transmembrane receptor anchorage may pose technical challenges along industrial translation, calling for alternative geometries for receptor multimerization. Here we developed a semisynthetic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanodecoy by multimerizing the biotin labelled virus cell receptor -ACE2- ectodomain onto a poly-avidin nanoparticle (NP) based on the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly-ANANAS. The ability of the assembly to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and the affinity of the ACE2:viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction were measured at different ACE2:NP ratios. At ACE2:NP = 30, 90 % SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition at ACE2 nanomolar concentration was registered on both Wuhan and Omicron variants, with ten-fold higher potency than the monomeric protein. Lower and higher ACE2 densities were less efficient suggesting that functional recognition between multi-ligand NPs and multi-receptor virus surfaces requires optimal geometrical relationships. In vivo studies in mice showed that the biodistribution and safety profiles of the nanodecoy are potentially suitable for preventing viral infection upon nasal instillation. Viral receptor multimerization using ANANAS is a convenient process which, in principle, could be rapidly adapted to counteract also other viral infections.

The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.

## Risk of T2 lesions when discontinuing fingolimod: a nationwide predictive and comparative study.
 12.01.2024, _MF Wandall-Holm, RP Holm, A Heick, AR Langkilde, M Magyari_


Fingolimod is a frequently used disease-modifying therapy in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. However, case reports and small observational studies indicate a highly increased risk of disease reactivation after discontinuation. We aimed to investigate the risk of radiological disease reactivation in patients discontinuing fingolimod. We performed a nationwide cohort study in Denmark, including patients who discontinued fingolimod between January 2014 and January 2023. Eligibility was a diagnosis with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and two MRIs performed respectively within 1 year before and after discontinuing fingolimod. The included patients were compared with those discontinuing dimethyl fumarate with the same eligibility criteria in an unadjusted and matched propensity score analysis. Matching was done on age, sex, Expanded Disability Status Scale, MRI data, cause for treatment discontinuation, treatment duration and relapse rate. The main outcome was the presence of new T2 lesions on the first MRI after treatment discontinuation. To identify high-risk patients among those discontinuing fingolimod, we made a predictive model assessing risk factors for obtaining new T2 lesions. Of 1324 patients discontinuing fingolimod in the study period, 752 were eligible for inclusion [mean age (standard deviation), years, 41 (10); 552 females (73%); median Expanded Disability Status Scale (Q1-Q3), 2.5 (2.0-3.5); mean disease duration (standard deviation), years, 12 (8)]. Of 2044 patients discontinuing dimethyl fumarate in the study period, 957 were eligible for inclusion, presenting similar baseline characteristics. Among patients discontinuing fingolimod, 127 (17%) had 1-2 new T2 lesions, and 124 (17%) had ≥3 new T2 lesions compared with 114 (12%) and 45 (5%), respectively, for those discontinuing dimethyl fumarate, corresponding to odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of 1.8 (1.3-2.3) and 4.4 (3.1-6.3). The predictive model, including 509 of the 752 patients discontinuing fingolimod, showed a highly increased risk of new T2 lesions among those with disease activity during fingolimod treatment and among females under 40 years. This nationwide study suggests that discontinuing fingolimod in some cases carries a risk of developing new T2 lesions, emphasizing the importance of clinical awareness. If feasible, clinicians should prioritize the prompt initiation of new disease-modifying therapies, particularly among young females.

The rhizosheath, a cohesive soil layer firmly adhering to plant roots, plays a vital role in facilitating water and mineral uptake. In pearl millet, rhizosheath formation is genetically controlled and influenced by root exudates. Here, we investigated the impact of root exudates on the microbiota composition, interactions, and assembly processes, and rhizosheath structure in pearl millet using four distinct lines with contrasting soil aggregation abilities.

## mEnrich-seq: methylation-guided enrichment sequencing of bacterial taxa of interest from microbiome.
 04.01.2024, _L Cao, Y Kong, Y Fan, M Ni, A Tourancheau, M Ksiezarek, EA Mead, T Koo, M Gitman, XS Zhang, G Fang_


Metagenomics has enabled the comprehensive study of microbiomes. However, many applications would benefit from a method that sequences specific bacterial taxa of interest, but not most background taxa. We developed mEnrich-seq (in which 'm' stands for methylation and seq for sequencing) for enriching taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self versus nonself differentiation by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, individually or in combination, to deplete host and background taxa while enriching targeted taxa. This idea is integrated with library preparation procedures and applied in several applications to enrich (up to 117-fold) pathogenic or beneficial bacteria from human urine and fecal samples, including species that are hard to culture or of low abundance. We assessed 4,601 bacterial strains with mapped methylomes so far and showed broad applicability of mEnrich-seq. mEnrich-seq provides microbiome researchers with a versatile and cost-effective approach for selective sequencing of diverse taxa of interest.

## Host genetic determinants drive compartment-specific assembly of tea plant microbiomes.

Diverse host factors drive microbial variation in plant-associated environments, whereas their genetic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. To address this, we coupled the analyses of plant genetics and microbiomes in this study. Using 100 tea plant (Camellia sinensis) cultivars, the microbiomes of rhizosphere, root endosphere and phyllosphere showed clear compartment-specific assembly, whereas the subpopulation differentiation of tea cultivars exhibited small effects on microbial variation in each compartment. Through microbiome genome-wide association studies, we examined the interactions between tea genetic loci and microbial variation. Notably, genes related to the cell wall and carbon catabolism were heavily linked to root endosphere microbial composition, whereas genes related to the metabolism of metal ions and small organic molecules were overrepresented in association with rhizosphere microbial composition. Moreover, a set of tea genetic variants, including the cytoskeleton-related formin homology interacting protein 1 gene, were strongly associated with the β-diversity of phyllosphere microbiomes, implying their interactions with the overall structure of microbial communities. Our results create a catalogue of tea genetic determinants interacting with microbiomes and reveal the compartment-specific microbiome assembly driven by host genetics.

We report a surge of patients, especially children and adolescents, with respiratory disease caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in Denmark since October 2023. While the surge has reached an epidemic level, no impact on hospital capacity has been observed; only 14% (446/3,195) of cases, primarily adults, required hospitalisation. Macrolide resistance was detected in less than 2% of samples tested. Timely monitoring of hospitalisations linked to M. pneumoniae infections has been established to inform the healthcare system, decisionmakers and the public.
