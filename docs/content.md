## The pneumococcal social network.

Gram-positive bacteria employ an array of secreted peptides to control population-level behaviors in response to environmental cues. We review mechanistic and functional features of secreted peptides produced by the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. We discuss sequence features, mechanisms of transport, and receptors for 3 major categories of small peptides: the double-glycine peptides, the Rap, Rgg, NprR, PlcR, and PrgX (RRNPP)-binding peptides, and the lanthionine-containing peptides. We highlight the impact of factors that contribute to carriage and pathogenesis, specifically genetic diversity, microbial competition, biofilm development, and environmental adaptation. A recent expansion in pneumococcal peptide studies reveals a complex network of interacting signaling systems where multiple peptides are integrated into the same signaling pathway, allowing multiple points of entry into the pathway and extending information content in new directions. In addition, since peptides are present in the extracellular milieu, there are opportunities for crosstalk, quorum sensing (QS), as well as intra- and interstrain and species interactions. Knowledge on the manner that population-level behaviors contribute to disease provides an avenue for the design and development of anti-infective strategies.
