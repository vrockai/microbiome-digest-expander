Elevated postprandial plasma glucose is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that the inter-individual postprandial plasma glucose response varies partly depending on the intestinal microbiome composition and function. We analyzed data from Danish adults (n = 106), who were self-reported healthy and attended the baseline visit of two previously reported randomized controlled cross-over trials within the Gut, Grain and Greens project. Plasma glucose concentrations at five time points were measured before and during three hours after a standardized breakfast. Based on these data, we devised machine learning algorithms integrating bio-clinical, as well as shotgun-sequencing-derived taxa and functional potentials of the intestinal microbiome to predict individual postprandial glucose excursions. In this post hoc study, we found microbial and clinical features, which predicted up to 48% of the inter-individual variance of postprandial plasma glucose responses (Pearson correlation coefficient of measured vs. predicted values, R = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.84, p&lt;0.001). The features were age, fasting serum triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, BMI, fasting total serum cholesterol, abundance of Bifidobacterium genus, richness of metagenomics species and abundance of a metagenomic species annotated to Clostridiales at order level. A model based only on microbial features predicted up to 14% of the variance in postprandial plasma glucose excursions (R = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.64, p = 0.04). Adding fasting glycaemic measures to the model including microbial and bio-clinical features increased the predictive power to R = 0.78 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.89, p&lt;0.001), explaining more than 60% of the inter-individual variance of postprandial plasma glucose concentrations. The outcome of the study points to a potential role of the taxa and functional potentials of the intestinal microbiome. If validated in larger studies our findings may be included in future algorithms attempting to develop personalized nutrition, especially for prediction of individual blood glucose excursions in dys-glycaemic individuals.

## Augmented Biodegradation of Textile Azo Dye Effluents by Plant Endophytes: A Sustainable, Eco-Friendly Alternative.
 20.09.2020, _BS Goud, HL Cha, G Koyyada, JH Kim_


Textile industry consumes a large proportion of available water and releases huge amounts of toxic azo dye effluents, leading to an inevitable situation of acute environmental pollution that has been a significant threat to mankind. Decolorization or detoxification of harmful azo dyes has become a global priority to overcome the disastrous consequences and salvage the ecosystem. Biodegradation of textile azo dyes by endophytes stands to be a lucrative and viable alternative over conventional physico-chemical methods, owing to their eco-friendliness, cost-competitive and non-toxic nature. Especially, plant endophytic microbes exhibit promising biodegradation potential which has wired up the effective removal of textile azo dyes, attributing to their ability to produce dye degrading enzymes, laccases, peroxidases and azoreductases. Although both bacterial and fungal endophytes have been tried for azo dye degradation, endophytic fungi find broader application over bacteria. Despite of the advancements made in microbe-mediated biodegradation, there is still a need to fill the gap in lab to in situ translation of biodegradation research. This review concisely accentuates the xenobiotics of textile azo dyes and microbial mechanisms of biodegradation of textile azo dyes, positing plant endophytic community, especially bacterial and fungal endophytes as the potential dye degraders, highlighting currently reported dye degrading endophytic species.
