The fungal component of the human gut microbiome, also known as the mycobiome, plays a vital role in intestinal ecology and human health. However, the overall structure of the gut mycobiome as well as the inter-individual variations in fungal composition remains largely unknown. In this study, we collected a total of 3363 fungal sequencing samples from 16 cohorts across three continents, including 572 newly profiled samples from China.

## Macroevolutionary constraints on global microbial diversity.
 11.08.2023, _FJ Fishman, JT Lennon_


Biologists have long sought to quantify the number of species on Earth. Often missing from these efforts is the contribution of microorganisms, the smallest but most abundant form of life on the planet. Despite recent large-scale sampling efforts, estimates of global microbial diversity span many orders of magnitude. It is important to consider how speciation and extinction over the last 4 billion years constrain inventories of biodiversity. We parameterized macroevolutionary models based on birth-death processes that assume constant and universal speciation and extinction rates. The models reveal that richness beyond 1012 species is feasible and in agreement with empirical predictions. Additional simulations suggest that mass extinction events do not place hard limits on modern-day microbial diversity. Together, our study provides independent support for a massive global-scale microbiome while shedding light on the upper limits of life on Earth.

## Evolutionary dynamics on sequential temporal networks.
 18.08.2023, _A Sheng, A Li, L Wang_


Population structure is a well-known catalyst for the evolution of cooperation and has traditionally been considered to be static in the course of evolution. Conversely, real-world populations, such as microbiome communities and online social networks, frequently show a progression from tiny, active groups to huge, stable communities, which is insufficient to be captured by constant structures. Here, we propose sequential temporal networks to characterize growing networked populations, and we extend the theory of evolutionary games to these temporal networks with arbitrary structures and growth rules. We derive analytical rules under which a sequential temporal network has a higher fixation probability for cooperation than its static counterpart. Under neutral drift, the rule is simply a function of the increment of nodes and edges in each time step. But if the selection is weak, the rule is related to coalescence times on networks. In this case, we propose a mean-field approximation to calculate fixation probabilities and critical benefit-to-cost ratios with lower calculation complexity. Numerical simulations in empirical datasets also prove the cooperation-promoting effect of population growth. Our research stresses the significance of population growth in the real world and provides a high-accuracy approximation approach for analyzing the evolution in real-life systems.

## Metagenome sequencing and 103 microbial genomes from ballast water and sediments.
 14.08.2023, _Z Xue, Y Han, W Tian, W Zhang_

The great threat of microbes carried by ballast water calls for figuring out the species composition of the ballast-tank microbial community, where the dark, cold, and anoxic tank environment might select special taxa. In this study, we reconstructed 103 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 102 bacteria and one archaea, from four vessels on international voyages. Of these MAGs, 60 were 'near complete' (completeness &gt;90%), 34 were &gt;80% complete, and nine were &gt;75% complete. Phylogenomic analysis revealed that over 70% (n = 74) of these MAGs represented new taxa at different taxonomical levels, including one order, three families, 12 genera, and 58 species. The species composition of these MAGs was most consistent with the previous reports, with the most abundant phyla being Proteobacteria (n = 69), Bacteroidota (n = 17), and Actinobacteriota (n = 7). These draft genomes provided novel data on species diversity and function in the ballast-tank microbial community, which will facilitate ballast water and sediments management.
