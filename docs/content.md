## Gut microbiota and microbiota-derived metabolites promotes endometriosis.
 24.01.2023, _SB Chadchan, SK Naik, P Popli, C Talwar, S Putluri, CR Ambati, MA Lint, AL Kau, CL Stallings, R Kommagani_


Endometriosis is a pathological condition of the female reproductive tract characterized by the existence of endometrium-like tissue at ectopic sites, affecting 10% of women between the age 15 and 49 in the USA. However, currently there is no reliable non-invasive method to detect the presence of endometriosis without surgery and many women find hormonal therapy and surgery as ineffective in avoiding the recurrences. There is a lack of knowledge on the etiology and the factors that contribute to the development of endometriosis. A growing body of recent evidence suggests an association between gut microbiota and endometriosis pathophysiology. However, the direct impact of microbiota and microbiota-derived metabolites on the endometriosis disease progression is largely unknown. To understand the causal role of gut microbiota and endometriosis, we have implemented a novel model using antibiotic-induced microbiota-depleted (MD) mice to investigate the endometriosis disease progression. Interestingly, we found that MD mice showed reduced endometriotic lesion growth and, the transplantation of gut microbiota by oral gavage of feces from mice with endometriosis rescued the endometriotic lesion growth. Additionally, using germ-free donor mice, we indicated that the uterine microbiota is dispensable for endometriotic lesion growth in mice. Furthermore, we showed that gut microbiota modulates immune cell populations in the peritoneum of lesions-bearing mice. Finally, we found a novel signature of microbiota-derived metabolites that were significantly altered in feces of mice with endometriosis. Finally, we found one the altered metabolite, quinic acid promoted the survival of endometriotic epithelial cells in vitro and lesion growth in vivo, suggesting the disease-promoting potential of microbiota-derived metabolites. In summary, these data suggest that gut microbiota and microbiota-derived metabolome contribute to lesion growth in mice, possibly through immune cell adaptations. Of translational significance, these findings will aid in designing non-invasive diagnostics using stool metabolites for endometriosis.

## Immune communication between the intestinal microbiota and the cardiovascular system.
 24.01.2023, _H Ren, B Zhu, Y An, F Xie, Y Wang, Y Tan_


The intestine hosts a large number of microbial communities. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota-mediated immune responses play a vital role in developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Immune cells are extensively infiltrated in the gut and heart tissues, such as T cells, B cells, and macrophages. They play a crucial role in the crosstalk between the heart and gut microbiota. And the microbiota influences the bidirectional function of immune cells in CVD such as myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis, including through metabolites. The mapping of immune cell-mediated immune networks in the heart and gut provides us with new targets for treating CVD. This review discusses the role of immune cells in gut microbiota and cardiac communication during health and CVD.

Paederus fuscipes is medically the most famous rove beetle, which causes dermatitis or conjunctivitis in humans, as well as gastrointestinal toxicosis in livestock, via releasing toxic hemolymph containing pederin. Pedrin biosynthesis genes have been identified in uncultured Pseudomonas-like endosymbionts that are speculated to be acquired through a horizontal transfer. However, the composition of the P. fuscipes microbial community, especially of the gut and genital microbiome, remains unclear. This study was aimed to characterize the structure and diversity of P. fuscipes-associated bacterial communities in terms of gender, organ, and location using the Illumina HiSeq platform in the southern littorals of Caspian Sea.

## The gastrointestinal microbiome in dairy cattle is constrained by the deterministic driver of the region and the modified effect of diet.

Dairy cattle (Bos taurus), especially Holstein cows, which are the highest-producing dairy animals and are widely bred to provide milk products to humans, rely critically on their associated gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota to digest plant feed. However, the region-specific taxonomic composition and function of the GIT microbiome in dairy cattle and the mechanistic basis for the diet-induced effects remain to be elucidated. RESULTS: We collected 120 digesta samples from 10 GIT regions of 12 Holstein cows fed forage- and grain-based diets and characterized their GIT microbiome via functional shotgun metagenomics and the resolution of metagenome-assembled genomes. Our results demonstrated that the GIT microbiome was mainly partitioned into three distinct clusters, four-chambered stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Moreover, we found that the four-chambered stomach microbiome with the highest diversity had a strong ability to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharide substrates, underpinned by the prevalence of potential cellulosome--producing and plant-derived polysaccharide utilization loci-encoding consortia. In contrast, the post-gastric intestinal microbiome orchestrated alternative fermentation pathways to adapt to nutrient availability and energy acquisition. Diet shifts selectively modified the metabolic cascades of the microbiome in specific GIT regions, evidenced by the loss of fiber-degrading taxa and increased hydrogen sinks in propionate after grain introduction.

## Fecal Microbiota Was Reshaped in UCP1 Knock-In Pigs via the Adipose-Liver-Gut Axis and Contributed to Less Fat Deposition.
 23.01.2023, _J Pan, L Chui, T Liu, Q Zheng, X Liu, L Liu, Y Zhao, L Zhang, M Song, J Han, J Huang, C Tang, C Tao, J Zhao, Y Wang_


The relationship between the host gut microbiota and obesity has been well documented in humans and mice; however, few studies reported the association between the gut microbiota and fat deposition in pigs. In a previous study, we generated uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) knock-in pigs (UCP1 pigs), which exhibited a lower fat deposition phenotype. Whether the gut microbiota was reshaped in these pigs and whether the reshaped gut microbiota contributes to the lower fat content remain unknown. Here, we revealed that the fecal microbiota composition and metabolites were significantly altered under both chow diet (CD) and high-fat/high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet conditions in UCP1 pigs compared to those in wild-type (WT) pigs. The abundance of Oscillospira and Coprococcus and the level of metabolite hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) from feces were observed to be significantly increased in UCP1 pigs. An association analysis revealed that Oscillospira and Coprococcus were significantly negatively related to backfat thickness. In addition, after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the mice that were orally gavaged with feces from UCP1 pigs exhibited less fat deposition under both CD and high-fat diet (HFD) conditions, suggesting that the fecal microbes of UCP1 pigs participate in regulating host lipid metabolism. Consistently, HDCA-treated mice also exhibited reduced fat content. Mechanistically, we found that UCP1 expression in white adipose tissue alters the gut microbiota via the adipose-liver-gut axis in pigs. Our study provides new data concerning the cross talk between host genetic variations and the gut microbiota and paves the way for the potential application of microbes or their metabolites in the regulation of fat deposition in pigs. IMPORTANCE This article investigated the effect of the ectopic expression of UCP1 on the regulation of fecal microbiota composition and metabolites and which alters the fat deposition phenotype. Bacteria, including Oscillospira and Coprococcus, and the metabolite HDCA were found to be significantly increased in feces of UCP1 pigs and had a negative relationship with backfat thickness. Mice with fecal microbiota transplantation phenocopied the UCP1 pigs under both CD and HFD conditions, suggesting that the fecal microbes of UCP1 pigs participate in regulating host lipid metabolism. Our study provides new data regarding the cross talk between host genetic variations and the gut microbiota and paves the way for the potential application of microbes or their metabolic production in the regulation of fat deposition in pigs.

## Gut microbiota of skywalker hoolock gibbons (Hoolock tianxing) from different habitats and in captivity: Implications for gibbon health.
 24.01.2023, _LY Lan, QX Hong, SM Gao, Q Li, YY You, W Chen, PF Fan_


The gut microbiota plays an integral role in the metabolism and immunity of animal hosts, and provides insights into the health and habitat assessment of threatened animals. The skywalker hoolock gibbon (Hoolock tianxing) is a newly described gibbon species, and is considered an endangered species. Here, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to describe the fecal bacterial community of skywalker hoolock gibbons from different habitats and in captivity. Fecal samples (n = 5) from two captive gibbons were compared with wild populations (N = 6 gibbons, n = 33 samples). At the phylum level, Spirochetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes dominated in captive gibbons, while Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Tenericutes dominated in wild gibbons. At the genus level, captive gibbons were dominated by Treponema-2, followed by Succinivibrio and Cerasicoccus, while wild gibbons were dominated by Anaeroplasma, Prevotellaceae UCG-001, and Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-004. Captive rearing was significantly associated with lower taxonomic alpha-diversity, and different relative abundance of some dominant bacteria compared to wild gibbons. Predicted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses showed that captive gibbons have significantly lower total pathway diversity and higher relative abundance of bacterial functions involved in "drug resistance: antimicrobial" and "carbohydrate metabolism" than wild gibbons. This study reveals the potential influence of captivity and habitat on the gut bacterial community of gibbons and provides a basis for guiding the conservation management of captive populations.

Community and diversity shifts of bacteria and microeukaryotes with strong environmental and spatial variations have been unveiled in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and northern coastal part of South China Sea (SCS). However, it is not clear what the determining factors shape the microbial community and how the biotic interactions respond to the estuarine and oceanic environment. Here, we established the multiple regression models (MRM) and co-occurrence networks on microbial communities in PRE and SCS habitats. The results showed that there were significant differences of the abiotic factors affecting the bacterial and microeukaryotic communities between PRE and SCS habitats. Salinity explained the largest variations to the microbial community dissimilarities in PRE. Whereas spatial and environmental factors determined the microbial community dissimilarities in SCS. Positive relations between parasitic lineages (e.g. Perkinsea and Cercozoa) and algal taxa (Dinophyceae, Cryptophyta, Chlorophyta and Ochrophyta) dominated in the PRE network. While parasites Syndiniales positively correlated with other Syndiniales and protists in SCS. Strong positive associations among autotrophic and heterotrophic groups were revealed in both niches. Therefore, the biotic interactions are also important and may be responsible for the unexplained variations of the abiotic factors from MRM models. Microbial network in the PRE estuarine water had weakened resistance to environmental disturbances, while the SCS network had greater capacity to maintain network stability. This study shed light on the different mechanisms of abiotic and biotic factors in shaping the compositions of bacteria and microeukaryotes between PRE and SCS niches, and highlights the weakening effect of environmental disturbances on the microbial network stability.

## PhaTYP: predicting the lifestyle for bacteriophages using BERT.
 23.01.2023, _J Shang, X Tang, Y Sun_

Bacteriophages (or phages), which infect bacteria, have two distinct lifestyles: virulent and temperate. Predicting the lifestyle of phages helps decipher their interactions with their bacterial hosts, aiding phages' applications in fields such as phage therapy. Because experimental methods for annotating the lifestyle of phages cannot keep pace with the fast accumulation of sequenced phages, computational method for predicting phages' lifestyles has become an attractive alternative. Despite some promising results, computational lifestyle prediction remains difficult because of the limited known annotations and the sheer amount of sequenced phage contigs assembled from metagenomic data. In particular, most of the existing tools cannot precisely predict phages' lifestyles for short contigs. In this work, we develop PhaTYP (Phage TYPe prediction tool) to improve the accuracy of lifestyle prediction on short contigs. We design two different training tasks, self-supervised and fine-tuning tasks, to overcome lifestyle prediction difficulties. We rigorously tested and compared PhaTYP with four state-of-the-art methods: DeePhage, PHACTS, PhagePred and BACPHLIP. The experimental results show that PhaTYP outperforms all these methods and achieves more stable performance on short contigs. In addition, we demonstrated the utility of PhaTYP for analyzing the phage lifestyle on human neonates' gut data. This application shows that PhaTYP is a useful means for studying phages in metagenomic data and helps extend our understanding of microbial communities.
