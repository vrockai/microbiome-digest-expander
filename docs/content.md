 20.11.2023, _L Peng, YH Zhang, GS Teng, CX Du, Y Wang, NB Hu, YQ Li, ZH Shao, J Bai_


Objective: To explore the clinical and laboratory characteristics of SF3B1 gene mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) patients. Methods: The clinical data of 273 MPN patients who were diagnosed MPN and treated in the Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University from November 2017 to March 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 133 males and 140 females, with a median age M(Q1,Q3)of 56(46, 67) years. The molecular biology and cytogenetic characteristics were detected by second-generation sequencing (NGS) and R+G banding techniques, and the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with SF3B1 gene mutation were analyzed. Results: SF3B1 gene mutations were found in 13 patients (4.8%, 13/273).The types of SF3B1 mutations included missense (92.3%, 12/13) and nonsense mutations (7.7%, 1/13).Compared to the non-mutant cohort, patients in SF3B1 mutant cohort had older ages [68(51, 76) vs 56(45, 66)years,P=0.025], higher proportion of splenomegaly [46.2%(6/13) vs 15.8%(41/259),P=0.014]and secondary tumor [23.1%(3/13)vs 3.8%(10/260), P=0.018]with higher proportion of bone marrow blast [0.5%(0, 1.5%) vs 0(0, 0.5%),P=0.002] and lower hemoglobin[(104±36) vs (137±40) g/L,P=0.004] and hematocrit [31%(22%, 40%) vs 41%(35%, 52%),P=0.003]. All of the 10 patients in the SF3B1 mutant cohort whose ring sideroblast (RS) could be evaluated showed no RS formation. The overall survival, thrombosis-free survival and leukemia free survival of MPN patients in SF3B1 mutant cohort were 4.0 (2.0, 6.0), 2.0 (0.5, 4.5) and 4.0 (2.0, 6.0) years, respectively, while patients in the non-mutant cohort were 6.0 (3.0, 10.0), 5.0 (1.0, 8.0), 6.0 (3.0, 10.0) years, respectively, there were no statistical significance between two groups (Z=3.69, 1.66, 2.05, all P&gt;0.05).The secondary tumor free survival of SF3B1 mutant cohort patients was 4.0 (2.0, 6.0) years, which was lower than that of non-mutant cohort patients [5.5 (3.0, 10.0) years, Z=18.18, P&lt;0.001). Conclusions: MPN patients with SF3B1 gene mutations are older, more prone to splenomegaly and secondary tumors. They also have a higher proportion of bone marrow blast, lower hemoglobin and hematocrit, and show no RS formation.

Companion animals can contribute to the physical and mental health of people and often live in very close association with their owners. However, the antibiotic resistome carried by companion animals and the impact they have on their owners and living environment remain unclear. In this study, we compared the ARG profiles of cats, humans, and their living environments using metagenomic analysis to identify the core ARGs in the cat and human gut and explore the potential impact of cats on ARGs in the human gut through the environment.

## A high-throughput and low-waste viability assay for microbes.
 03.11.2023, _CT Meyer, GK Lynch, DF Stamo, EJ Miller, A Chatterjee, JM Kralj_


Counting viable cells is a universal practice in microbiology. The colony-forming unit (CFU) assay has remained the gold standard to measure viability across disciplines, but it is time-intensive and resource-consuming. Here we describe the geometric viability assay (GVA) that replicates CFU measurements over 6 orders of magnitude while reducing over 10-fold the time and consumables required. GVA computes a sample's viable cell count on the basis of the distribution of embedded colonies growing inside a pipette tip. GVA is compatible with Gram-positive and Gram-negative planktonic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis), biofilms and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Laborious CFU experiments such as checkerboard assays, treatment time-courses and drug screens against slow-growing cells are simplified by GVA. The ease and low cost of GVA evinces that it can replace existing viability assays and enable viability measurements at previously impractical scales.

## Comparison of gene clustering criteria reveals intrinsic uncertainty in pangenome analyses.
 07.11.2023, _S Manzano-Morales, Y Liu, S González-Bodí, J Huerta-Cepas, J Iranzo_


_Phylogeny, Reproducibility of Results, Uncertainty, Genome Size, Cluster Analysis_
A key step for comparative genomics is to group open reading frames into functionally and evolutionarily meaningful gene clusters. Gene clustering is complicated by intraspecific duplications and horizontal gene transfers that are frequent in prokaryotes. In consequence, gene clustering methods must deal with a trade-off between identifying vertically transmitted representatives of multicopy gene families, which are recognizable by synteny conservation, and retrieving complete sets of species-level orthologs. We studied the implications of adopting homology, orthology, or synteny conservation as formal criteria for gene clustering by performing comparative analyses of 125 prokaryotic pangenomes.

## ACR: metagenome-assembled prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome refinement tool.
 02.11.2023, _HJ Seong, JJ Kim, WJ Sul_


_Metagenome, Eukaryota, Microbiota, Algorithms, Metagenomics, Cluster Analysis_
Microbial genome recovery from metagenomes can further explain microbial ecosystem structures, functions and dynamics. Thus, this study developed the Additional Clustering Refiner (ACR) to enhance high-purity prokaryotic and eukaryotic metagenome-assembled genome (MAGs) recovery. ACR refines low-quality MAGs by subjecting them to iterative k-means clustering predicated on contig abundance and increasing bin purity through validated universal marker genes. Synthetic and real-world metagenomic datasets, including short- and long-read sequences, evaluated ACR's effectiveness. The results demonstrated improved MAG purity and a significant increase in high- and medium-quality MAG recovery rates. In addition, ACR seamlessly integrates with various binning algorithms, augmenting their strengths without modifying core features. Furthermore, its multiple sequencing technology compatibilities expand its applicability. By efficiently recovering high-quality prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, ACR is a promising tool for deepening our understanding of microbial communities through genome-centric metagenomics.

## Acceptance of COVID-19 boosters among hypertensive patients in China: A multicenter cross-sectional study.
 20.11.2023, _Y Yan, Q Chen, A Nuermaimaiti, Y Xiao, L Chang, H Ji, H Sun, Q Song, Y Gao, J Xu, L Wang_


Hypertension, a prevalent chronic disease, has been associated with increased COVID-19 severity. To promote the COVID-19 booster vaccination of hypertensive patients, this study investigated the willingness to receive boosters and the related influencing factors based on the health belief model (HBM model). Between June and October 2022, 453 valid questionnaires were collected across three Chinese cities. The willingness to receive a booster vaccination was 72.2%. The main factors that influenced the willingness of patients with hypertension to receive a booster shot were male (χ2 = 7.008, p = .008), residence in rural (χ2 = 4.778, p = .029), being in employment (χ2 = 7.232, p = .007), taking no or less antihypertensive medication (χ2 = 9.372, p = .025), with less hypertension-related comorbidities (χ2 = 35.888, p &lt; .0001), and did not have any other chronic diseases (χ2 = 28.476, p &lt; .0001). Amid the evolving COVID-19 landscape, the willingness to receive annual booster vaccination was 59.4%, and employment status (χ2 = 10.058, p = .002), and presence of other chronic diseases (χ2 = 14.256, p &lt; .0001) are associated with the willingness of annual booster vaccination. Respondents with higher perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived self-efficacy, and lower perceived barriers were more willing to receive booster shots. The mean and median value of willingness to pay (WTP) for a dose of booster were 53.17 CNY and 28.31 CNY. Concerns regarding booster safety and the need for professional advice were prevalent. Our findings highlight the importance of promoting booster safety knowledge and health-related management among hypertensive individuals through professional organizations and medical specialists.
