## Comparison of gene clustering criteria reveals intrinsic uncertainty in pangenome analyses.

_Phylogeny, Reproducibility of Results, Uncertainty, Genome Size, Cluster Analysis_
A key step for comparative genomics is to group open reading frames into functionally and evolutionarily meaningful gene clusters. Gene clustering is complicated by intraspecific duplications and horizontal gene transfers that are frequent in prokaryotes. In consequence, gene clustering methods must deal with a trade-off between identifying vertically transmitted representatives of multicopy gene families, which are recognizable by synteny conservation, and retrieving complete sets of species-level orthologs. We studied the implications of adopting homology, orthology, or synteny conservation as formal criteria for gene clustering by performing comparative analyses of 125 prokaryotic pangenomes.

## Views and Perceptions of Medical Representatives and Physicians about the Role of Medical Representatives and Pharmaceutical Advertisement in Saudi Arabia - A Pilot Study.
 16.11.2023, _S Faqeh, S Alansari, A Althagafi, A Abdulaziz, A Alhajjaji, A Kurdi, M Allihyani, M Qashlan, R Alhotirshi, R Alhassani, S Alsurayhi, O Alshareef, M Ali_


Medical representatives (MRs) frequently interact with physicians who may have different perceptions about and expectations from product promotional activities by pharmaceutical companies, especially through MRs. This can affect their prescribing practice. We explored the views and perceptions of MRs and physicians about the role of MRs and pharmaceutical advertisements in Saudi Arabia.
