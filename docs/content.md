Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, age-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects a large proportion of the elderly population. It currently lacks effective treatments, placing a heavy burden on patients, families, healthcare systems, and society. This is mainly due to our limited comprehension of the pathophysiology of AD progression, as well as the lack of effective drug targets and intervention timing to address the underlying pathology. AD is a multifactorial condition, and emerging evidence suggests that abnormalities in the gut microbiota play a significant role as environmental and multifaceted contributors to AD, although the exact mechanisms are yet to be fully explored. Changes in the composition of microbiota influence host neuronal health through their metabolites. These metabolites regulate intestinal epithelia, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and neuroinflammation by impacting mitochondrial function. The decline in the proportion of beneficial microbes and their essential metabolites during aging and AD is directly linked to poor mitochondrial function, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear. In this review, we discuss recent developments in understanding the impact of the microbiome and its metabolites on various cell types, their influence on the integrity of the gut and BBB barriers, systemic and brain inflammation, and cell-specific effects in AD pathology. This information is expected to pave the way for a new understanding of the interactions between microbiota and mitochondria in AD, providing a foundation for the development of novel treatments for AD.

## Genomic surveillance for antimicrobial resistance - a One Health perspective.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) - the ability of microorganisms to adapt and survive under diverse chemical selection pressures - is influenced by complex interactions between humans, companion and food-producing animals, wildlife, insects and the environment. To understand and manage the threat posed to health (human, animal, plant and environmental) and security (food and water security and biosecurity), a multifaceted 'One Health' approach to AMR surveillance is required. Genomic technologies have enabled monitoring of the mobilization, persistence and abundance of AMR genes and mutations within and between microbial populations. Their adoption has also allowed source-tracing of AMR pathogens and modelling of AMR evolution and transmission. Here, we highlight recent advances in genomic AMR surveillance and the relative strengths of different technologies for AMR surveillance and research. We showcase recent insights derived from One Health genomic surveillance and consider the challenges to broader adoption both in developed and in lower- and middle-income countries.

## Lung Microbiome as a Treatable Trait in Chronic Respiratory Disorders.

Once thought to be a sterile environment, it is now established that lungs are populated by various microorganisms that participate in maintaining lung function and play an important role in shaping lung immune surveillance. Although our comprehension of the molecular and metabolic interactions between microbes and lung cells is still in its infancy, any event causing a persistent qualitative or quantitative variation in the composition of lung microbiome, termed "dysbiosis", has been virtually associated with many respiratory diseases. A deep understanding of the composition and function of the "healthy" lung microbiota and how dysbiosis can cause or participate in disease progression will be pivotal in finding specific therapies aimed at preventing diseases and restoring lung function. Here, we review lung microbiome dysbiosis in different lung pathologies and the mechanisms by which these bacteria can cause or contribute to the severity of the disease. Furthermore, we describe how different respiratory disorders can be caused by the same pathogen, and that the real pathogenetic mechanism is not only dependent by the presence and amount of the main pathogen but can be shaped by the interaction it can build with other bacteria, fungi, and viruses present in the lung. Understanding the nature of this bacteria crosstalk could further our understanding of each respiratory disease leading to the development of new therapeutic strategies.
