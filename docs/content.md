## Altered cervicovaginal microbiota in premenopausal ovarian cancer patients.

Nearly three hundred thousand female patients are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the world annually, and this number shows an increasing trend. However, characteristic symptoms caused by ovarian cancer are so few that early diagnosis remains challenging, and an effective screening method has not yet been established. Here, we conducted a case-control study in Japan to analyze the association between cervicovaginal microbiome and ovarian cancer, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Analysis of DNA extracted from cervical smear samples revealed Lactobacillus-dominant and Lactobacillus-deficient, highly-diversified bacterial communities in premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy controls, respectively, as reported for vaginal microbiota previously. We found that cervicovaginal microbiota in ovarian cancer patients, regardless of their menopausal status, were frequently a diversified community and similar to those in healthy subjects at postmenopausal ages. The diverse microbiota was associated with the major histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, including serous ovarian cancer and ovarian clear cell cancer. The present study implies the potential of a cervicovaginal microbiome biomarker in screening ovarian cancer in premenopausal women.

## Studies and Application of Sialylated Milk Components on Regulating Neonatal Gut Microbiota and Health.
 04.12.2021, _Y Wang, X Ze, B Rui, X Li, N Zeng, J Yuan, W Li, J Yan, M Li_


Breast milk is rich in sialic acids (SA), which are commonly combined with milk oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. As a functional nutrient component, SA-containing milk components have received increasing attention in recent years. Sialylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been demonstrated to promote the growth and metabolism of beneficial gut microbiota in infants, bringing positive outcomes to intestinal health and immune function. They also exhibit antiviral and bacteriostatic activities in the intestinal mucosa of new-borns, thereby inhibiting the adhesion of pathogens to host cells. These properties play a pivotal role in regulating the intestinal microbial ecosystem and preventing the occurrence of neonatal inflammatory diseases. In addition, some recent studies also support the promoting effects of sialylated HMOs on neonatal bone and brain development. In addition to HMOs, sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids are abundant in milk, and are also critical to neonatal health. This article reviews the current research progress in the regulation of sialylated milk oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates on neonatal gut microbiota and health.

## The highly diverse Antarctic Peninsula soil microbiota as a source of novel resistance genes.

The rise of multiresistant bacterial pathogens is currently one of the most critical threats to global health, encouraging a better understanding of the evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance. In this regard, the role of the environment as a source of resistance mechanisms remains poorly understood. Moreover, we still know a minimal part of the microbial diversity and resistome present in remote and extreme environments, hosting microbes that evolved to resist harsh conditions and thus a potentially rich source of novel resistance genes. This work demonstrated that the Antarctic Peninsula soils host a remarkable microbial diversity and a widespread presence of autochthonous antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes. We observed resistance to a wide array of antibiotics among isolates, including Pseudomonas resisting ten or more different compounds, with an overall increased resistance in bacteria from non-intervened areas. In addition, genome analysis of selected isolates showed several genes encoding efflux pumps, as well as a lack of known resistance genes for some of the resisted antibiotics, including colistin, suggesting novel uncharacterized mechanisms. By combining metagenomic approaches based on analyzing raw reads, assembled contigs, and metagenome-assembled genomes, we found hundreds of widely distributed genes potentially conferring resistance to different antibiotics (including an outstanding variety of inactivation enzymes), metals, and biocides, hosted mainly by Polaromonas, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Variovorax, and Burkholderia. Furthermore, a proportion of these genes were found inside predicted plasmids and other mobile elements, including a putative OXA-like carbapenemase from Polaromonas harboring conserved key residues and predicted structural features. All this evidence indicates that the Antarctic Peninsula soil microbiota has a broad natural resistome, part of which could be transferred horizontally to pathogenic bacteria, acting as a potential source of novel resistance genes.
