The human microbiome is increasingly mined for diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers using machine learning (ML). However, metagenomics-specific software is scarce, and overoptimistic evaluation and limited cross-study generalization are prevailing issues. To address these, we developed SIAMCAT, a versatile R toolbox for ML-based comparative metagenomics. We demonstrate its capabilities in a meta-analysis of fecal metagenomic studies (10,803 samples). When naively transferred across studies, ML models lost accuracy and disease specificity, which could however be resolved by a novel training set augmentation strategy. This reveals some biomarkers to be disease-specific, with others shared across multiple conditions. SIAMCAT is freely available from siamcat.embl.de .

Bacillus cereus is widely distributed in the environment and is responsible for foodborne illnesses, causing diarrhea and vomiting. In this study, the prevalence of B. cereus bacteriophages in Korean fermented foods was studied using 6 reference strains, and JBP901 was further characterized. In a total of 47 samples, 19 (40.4%) contained more than one kind of B. cereus phage. Fourteen phages were purified and determined for host lysis profile. Among them, JBP901 was specific to B. cereus group strains (forming plaques in 13 of 14 isolates) and not able to lyse other tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains including Bacillus subtilis. Transmission electron microscopy analysis suggested that JBP901 is a member of the family Myoviridae. Restriction enzyme digestion pattern analysis and one-step growth study indicated a genome size of approximately 150 kbp and a burst size of 100. Furthermore, bacterial lysis studies revealed that JBP901 could be used to control the growth of B. cereus in liquid culture and in food. This is the first report to examine the prevalence of phages in fermented foods in Korea, and suggests that fermented foods are useful sources of B. cereus phage isolation; moreover, B. cereus phages could provide an additional tool to tackle problems associated with B. cereus contamination.

## Connecting structure to function with the recovery of over 1000 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes from activated sludge using long-read sequencing.

Microorganisms play crucial roles in water recycling, pollution removal and resource recovery in the wastewater industry. The structure of these microbial communities is increasingly understood based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data. However, such data cannot be linked to functional potential in the absence of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for nearly all species. Here, we use long-read and short-read sequencing to recover 1083 high-quality MAGs, including 57 closed circular genomes, from 23 Danish full-scale wastewater treatment plants. The MAGs account for ~30% of the community based on relative abundance, and meet the stringent MIMAG high-quality draft requirements including full-length rRNA genes. We use the information provided by these MAGs in combination with &gt;13 years of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data, as well as Raman microspectroscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridisation, to uncover abundant undescribed lineages belonging to important functional groups.

## Democratising deep learning for microscopy with ZeroCostDL4Mic.

Deep Learning (DL) methods are powerful analytical tools for microscopy and can outperform conventional image processing pipelines. Despite the enthusiasm and innovations fuelled by DL technology, the need to access powerful and compatible resources to train DL networks leads to an accessibility barrier that novice users often find difficult to overcome. Here, we present ZeroCostDL4Mic, an entry-level platform simplifying DL access by leveraging the free, cloud-based computational resources of Google Colab. ZeroCostDL4Mic allows researchers with no coding expertise to train and apply key DL networks to perform tasks including segmentation (using U-Net and StarDist), object detection (using YOLOv2), denoising (using CARE and Noise2Void), super-resolution microscopy (using Deep-STORM), and image-to-image translation (using Label-free prediction - fnet, pix2pix and CycleGAN). Importantly, we provide suitable quantitative tools for each network to evaluate model performance, allowing model optimisation. We demonstrate the application of the platform to study multiple biological processes.

## Derivation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Lines from Patient-Specific Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) Using Episomal Vectors.
 27.03.2021, _VBR Konala, S Nandakumar, H Surendran, R Pal_


Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a diverse group of rare eye disorders, resulting in vision loss or blindness. The underlying reason is mutation in one or more than 250 different genes associated with the development and normal physiology of retina largely comprising of rod/cone photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium. Interestingly, the sub retinal region of an eye has been shown to be immune privileged, broadening the scope of cell-replacement therapies for patients suffering from retinal degeneration. Several groups around the globe, including ours, have demonstrated safety and efficacy in preclinical studies by employing various approaches of retinal cell therapy. This had largely been possible with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-reprogrammed from adult somatic cells, that serves as a starting material for generating retinal cells de novo. Here, we describe a detailed procedure for reprogramming peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) into iPSC using episomal vectors without any physical disruption in the host genome. The lines thus created were tested for sterility, cytogenetic stability, identity, absence of episomal plasmids and further authenticated for pluripotency and tri-lineage differentiation capacity by embryoid body formation and immunocytochemistry. We believe that this feeder-cell free, animal-product free and gene-insertion free protocol would help people to develop and bank patient-specific cell lines for autologous cell therapies for incurable rare diseases.
