## Differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome based on metagenomic analysis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
 19.07.2021, _H Fan, X Hong, J Zeng, X Wang, J Chen_


_Acupuncture Therapy, Clomiphene, Female, Humans, Menstruation, Obesity, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic_
Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common cause of infertility and shows a high incidence in women of reproductive age. Acupuncture is an appropriate adjunctive treatment for PCOS. However, the add-on effect of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for obese women with PCOS has not been studied, and previous studies indicate that there are individual differences in the curative effect of acupuncture, while deeper research on the mechanism of differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS is still lacking. This trial aims to assess the add-on treatment efficacy of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS and to explore the role of the gut microbiome on the differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture based on metagenomic analysis.

Although recent studies have indicated that intestinal microbiota dweller are involved in the pathogenesis of allergy rhinitis (AR), the influence of gut microbiota on AR adult has not been fully elucidated yet. Hence, we carried out this study to uncover the distinctive bacterial taxa that differentiate allergy rhinitis patients from healthy individuals. Feces samples from thirty three AR patients and thirty one healthy individuals were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

## The Multiple Lenses on the Community Health System: Implications for Policy, Practice and Research.
 18.07.2021, _H Schneider, J Olivier, M Orgill, L Brady, E Whyle, J Zulu, MS Sebastian, A George_


Community health systems (CHSs) have historically been approached from multiple perspectives, with different purposes and methodological and disciplinary orientations. The terrain is, on the one hand, vast and diverse. On the other hand, under the banner of universal health coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a streamlined version of 'community health' is increasingly being consolidated in global health and donor communities. With the view to informing debate and practice, this paper seeks to synthesise approaches to the CHS into a set of 'lenses,' drawing on the collective and multi-disciplinary knowledge (both formal and experiential) of the authors, a collaborative network of 23 researchers from seven institutions across six countries (spanning low, middle and high income). With a common view of the CHS as a complex adaptive system, we propose four key lenses, referred to as programmatic, relational, collective action and critical lenses. The lenses represent different positionalities in community health, encompassing macro-level policy-maker, front-line and community vantage points, and purposes ranging from social justice to instrumental goals. We define and describe the main elements of each lens and their implications for thinking about policy, practice and research. Distilling a set of key lenses offers a way to make sense of a complex terrain, but also counters what may emerge as a dominant, single narrative on the CHS in global health. By making explicit and bringing together different lenses on the CHS, the limits and possibilities of each may be better appreciated, while promoting integrative, systems thinking in policy, practice and research.

## Bacterial spectrum analysis and antimicrobial susceptibility study of osteoradionecrosis of the jaw in Southern China.
 17.07.2021, _Y Zhu, J Liang, F Wang, J Li, C Wang, J Hou_


Osteoradionecrosis of the jaw (ORNJ) is one of the most common and serious complications after radiotherapy of head and neck malignancies due to the high incidence of nasopharyngeal cancer in Southern China. Clinicians lack understanding and consensus on anti-infective treatment in ORNJ lesions. This research aims to provide evidence for rational use of antibiotics by reviewing the bacterial spectrums and antimicrobial susceptibility test of ORNJ patients.

## Chlortetracycline alters microbiota of gut or faeces in pigs and leads to accumulation and migration of antibiotic resistance genes.
 19.07.2021, _X Ma, Z Yang, T Xu, M Qian, X Jiang, X Zhan, X Han_


In this study, we investigated the effect of long-term use of chlortetracycline (CTC) on the gut microbiota composition and metabolism profiles in pigs, and the variation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities in faeces and manure during aerobic composting (AC) and anaerobic digestion (AD). The pigs were fed the same basal diet supplemented with or without 75 mg/kg CTC, and fresh faeces of 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-day-old pigs were collected from the CTC group. The results showed that CTC reduced the diversity of the gut microbiota significantly and changed its structure. Metabolomics analysis of intestinal contents revealed 23 differentially abundant metabolites, mainly organic acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Metabolic pathways, such as the TCA cycle, propionate metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism, were changed. From 30 to 120 days of age, the amount of CTC residues in faeces and the abundance of 3 tetracycline resistance genes increased significantly, and it was positively correlated with tetC, tetG, tetW, sul1 and intI2. CTC residue levels and ARGs abundance gradually decreased with fermentation time, and AC was better than AD at reducing ARGs abundance. The results suggest that in-feed CTC can reduce the diversity of the gut microbiota, change the structure, function and metabolism of the bacterial community, and increase the abundance of ARGs in faeces.
