Sterilising immunity that blocks infection for life, and thus prevents illness after infection, is the ultimate goal for vaccines. Neither influenza infection nor vaccination provide sterilising immunity. Mutations during influenza viral genome replication result in the emergence of viruses that evade immunity and cause reinfections. Waning of immunity also results in reinfections to homologous influenza viruses. However, immunity might limit the severity of disease after infection or vaccination (ie, immunoattenuation). We provide a comprehensive examination of experimental and observational peer reviewed evidence since 1933, when the first influenza virus was isolated, on whether immunity blocks subsequent infection or attenuates illness. Although an abundance of experimental evidence supports immunoattenuation, clinical evidence is rudimentary and conflicting. To the extent that immunoattenuation occurs, understanding the varied pathways to illness, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and correlates of attenuation can improve the design and evaluation of influenza vaccines. By elucidating the mechanisms of immunoattenuation and phenotypes of illness, we clarify ambiguities and identify unmet needs that, if addressed with priority, could strategically improve the design of vaccines for the prevention of influenza.

## Oro-facial mucocutaneous manifestations of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review.
 02.06.2022, _KS Fakhruddin, LP Samaranayake, B Buranawat, H Ngo_


We reviewed the prevalence, the likely aetiopathogenesis, and the management of oro-facial mucocutaneous manifestations of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2). English language manuscripts searched using standard databases yielded 26 articles that met the inclusion criteria. In total, 169 cases (75 females; 94 males) from 15 countries with a spectrum of COVID-19 severities were reviewed. Gustatory perturbations were prevalent in over 70%. Mucocutaneous manifestations were reported predominantly on the tongue, palate, buccal mucosa, gingivae, and lips and included ulcers, blisters, erosions, papillary hyperplasia, macules, glossitis, and mucositis. Ulcerative lesions, present in over 50 percent, were the most common oral manifestation. Lesions resembling candidal infections, with burning mouth, were prevalent in 19%. Petechiae and angina bullosa were generally seen, subsequent to COVID-19 therapies, in 11%. Ulcerated, necrotic gingivae were documented in severely ill with poor oral hygiene. These manifestations, present across the COVID-19 disease spectrum, were commonly associated with the immunosuppressed state and/ or the concurrent antimicrobial/steroidal therapies. In summary, a wide variety of orofacial mucocutaneous lesions manifest in COVID-19. They are likely to be secondary to the disease-associated immune impairment and/or pharmaco-therapy rather than a direct result of SARS-CoV-2 infection per se.

## Determinants of the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy spectrum.
 02.06.2022, _R Piltch-Loeb, DR Silver, Y Kim, H Norris, E McNeill, DM Abramson_


Vaccine hesitancy remains an issue in the United States. This study conducted an online survey [N = 3,013] using the Social Science Research Solution [SSRS] Opinion Panel web panelists, representative of U.S. adults age 18 and older who use the internet, with an oversample of rural-dwelling and minority populations between April 8 and April 22, 2021- as vaccine eligibility opened to the country. We examined the relationship between COVID-19 exposure and socio-demographics with vaccine intentions [eager-to-take, wait-and-see, undecided, refuse] among the unvaccinated using multinomial logistic regressions [ref: fully/partially vaccinated]. Results showed vaccine intentions varied by demographic characteristics and COVID-19 experience during the period that eligibility for the vaccine was extended to all adults. At the time of the survey approximately 40% of respondents were unvaccinated; 41% knew someone who had died of COVID-19, and 38% had experienced financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. The vaccinated were more likely to be highly educated, older adults, consistent with the United States initial eligibility criteria. Political affiliation and financial hardship experienced during the pandemic were the two most salient factors associated with being undecided or unwilling to take the vaccine.
