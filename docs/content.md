## Intestinal microbiota and its association with colon cancer and red/processed meat consumption.
 21.03.2020, _N Abu-Ghazaleh, WJ Chua, V Gopalan_


The human colon harbours a high number of microorganisms that were reported to play a crucial role in colorectal carcinogenesis. In the recent decade, molecular detection and metabolomic techniques have expanded our knowledge on the role of specific microbial species in promoting tumorigenesis. In this study, we reviewed the association between microbial dysbiosis and colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Various microbial species and their association with colorectal tumorigenesis and red/processed meat consumption have been reviewed. The literature demonstrated a significant abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis in patients with adenoma or adenocarcinoma compared to healthy individuals. The mechanisms in which each organism was postulated to promote colon carcinogenesis were collated and summarised in this review. These include the microorganisms' ability to adhere to colon cells, modulate the inhibition of tumour suppressor genes, the activations of oncogenes, genotoxicity and activate downstream targets responsible for angiogenesis. The role of these microorganisms in conjugation with meat components including N-nitroso compounds, heterocyclic amines, and heme was also evident in multiple studies. The outcome of this review supports the role of red meat consumption in modulating CRC progression and the possibility of gut microbiome influencing the relationship between CRC and diet. The study also demonstrates that microbiota analysis could potentially complement existing screening methods when detecting colonic lesions.

## Is it time to consider gut microbiome readouts for precision diagnosis and treatment of alcoholic liver disease?
 21.03.2020, _GAM Cresci_


The mutualistic relationship that exists between gut microbes and the host aids in digestion and metabolism, defends against pathogens, and supports host immunity. Beneficial gut microbes and phages employ various mechanisms to facilitate host defense including competing for nutritional resources, producing antibiotics, providing metabolic inhibition and spatial occlusion, as well as communicating with the host immune system.

## Characteristics of the urinary microbiome in kidney stone patients with hypertension.
 18.03.2020, _F Liu, N Zhang, P Jiang, Q Zhai, C Li, D Yu, Y Wu, Y Zhang, L Lv, X Xu, N Feng_


Kidney stone disease (KSD) is more common in individuals with hypertension (HTN) than in individuals with normotension (NTN). Urinary dysbiosis is associated with urinary tract disease and systemic diseases. However, the role of the urinary microbiome in KSD complicated with HTN remains unclear.
