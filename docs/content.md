Fungi constitute an important yet frequently neglected component of the human microbiota with a possible role in health and disease. Fungi and bacteria colonise the infant gastrointestinal tract in parallel, yet most infant microbiome studies have ignored fungi. Milk is a source of diverse and viable bacteria, but few studies have assessed the diversity of fungi in human milk.

## Metabolic syndrome, depression, and fibromyalgia syndrome prevalence in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A case-control study.
 05.06.2020, _M Bayrak_


Although both metabolic syndrome (MetS) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been linked with altered gut microbiota, only a few studies investigated the association between them. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of MetS along with depression and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) in IBS patients.This was a case-control study in which 3808 consecutive patients who attended outpatient clinics of Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital between May 2019 and August 2019 were evaluated in terms of IBS with Rome-IV criteria. Out of 486 patients who were diagnosed as IBS, 176 patients were excluded for various reasons. Control subjects were randomly selected from IBS-negative subjects. MetS was diagnosed based on International Diabetes Federation criteria. Depression, anxiety disorder, and FMS were assessed via Hamilton Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and American College of Rheumatology criteria, respectively. Blood samples were obtained to measure biochemical parameters.Study group included 310 IBS patients, and control group included 304 subjects. The prevalence of the MetS was significantly higher among IBS patients compared with controls (36.8% vs 21.7%, respectively, P = .006). The rate of obesity was 18.1% among IBS subjects, and 10.2% in the controls. The prevalence of fibromyalgia (30% vs 3%, respectively, P &lt; .001), anxiety-disorder (39.7% vs 10.2%, P &lt; .001) and depression (8.1% vs 4.9%, P &lt; .001) were significantly higher in IBS group than controls.Metabolic syndrome and obesity were significantly more frequent in IBS patients compared with controls. FMS, anxiety disorder, and depression were also more common among IBS patients.

## Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and intestinal microbiota-toward establishing cause and effect.
 05.06.2020, _M Gotkine, D Kviatcovsky, E Elinav_


The intestinal microbiota may be involved, through metabolic gut-brain interactions, in a variety of neurological conditions. In this addendum, we summarize the findings of our recent study investigating the potentially modulatory influence of the microbiome in a transgenic ALS mouse model, and the possible application to human disease. We found that transgenic mice show evidence of dysbiosis, even at the pre-symptomatic stage, and have a more severe disease course under germ-free conditions or after receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. We demonstrated that Akkermansia muciniphila ameliorated the disease in mice and that this may be due to the production of nicotinamide. We then conducted a preliminary study in human ALS and identified functionally similar alterations within the metagenome. Furthermore, we found that patients with ALS had lower systemic and CSF levels of nicotinamide, suggesting that the changes observed in the mouse model may be relevant to human disease.

## Altered fecal microbiota on the expression of Th Cells responses in the exacerbation of patients with hepatitis E infection.

Fulminant hepatitis E may lead to acute liver failure (ALF). Perturbations of intestinal microbiota are related to severe liver disease. To study the correlations between fecal microbiota and the occurrence and exacerbation of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) infection we characterized 24 fecal samples from 12 patients with acute hepatitis E (AHE) and 12 patients with HEV-ALF using high-throughput sequencing. We found both the alpha and beta diversity indices showed no significant differences between the AHE and HEV-ALF groups. Several predominant taxa were significantly different between the AHE and HEV-ALF groups. Most notably, the HEV-ALF group had increased levels of Gammaproteobacteria, Proteobacteria, Xanthomonadceae, and Stenotrophomonas, but reduced levels of Firmicutes, Streptococcus, Subdoligranulum, and Lactobacillus, compared with the AHE group. The levels of Lactobacillaceae and Gammaproteobacteria could be used to distinguish patients with HEV-ALF from those with AHE. In addition, the level of Th lymphocytes was significantly lower in the HEV-ALF group than in the AHE group. The relative abundances of Lactobacillaceae and Gammaproteobacteria were positively correlated with Th lymphocytes, serum international normalized ratio (INR), and hepatic encephalopathy severity. Moreover, surviving patients had higher levels of Lactobacillus mucosae than deceased patients. Our study demonstrated that the presence of altered fecal microbiota is associated with exacerbation of HEV infection; this finding may be useful for exploring the interactions among fecal microbiota, immune responses, mechanisms of infection and progression in patients with HEV, as well as for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
