## Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): new challenges and new responsibilities in developing countries.
 05.06.2020, _FR Anjum, S Anam, SU Rahman_


Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which belongs to the genus Coronaviridae with its high mutation rate. From the current perspective, we discuss the current status of COVID-19, new challenges, and potential interventions to control the pandemic in developing counties such as Pakistan.

## Microplastics provide new microbial niches in aquatic environments.
 05.06.2020, _Y Yang, W Liu, Z Zhang, HP Grossart, GM Gadd_


Microplastics in the biosphere are currently of great environmental concern because of their potential toxicity for aquatic biota and human health and association with pathogenic microbiota. Microplastics can occur in high abundance in all aquatic environments, including oceans, rivers and lakes. Recent findings have highlighted the role of microplastics as important vectors for microorganisms, which can form fully developed biofilms on this artificial substrate. Microplastics therefore provide new microbial niches in the aquatic environment, and the developing biofilms may significantly differ in microbial composition compared to natural free-living or particle-associated microbial populations in the surrounding water. In this article, we discuss the composition and ecological function of the microbial communities found in microplastic biofilms. The potential factors that influence the richness and diversity of such microbial microplastic communities are also evaluated. Microbe-microbe and microbe-substrate interactions in microplastic biofilms have been little studied and are not well understood. Multiomics tools together with morphological, physiological and biochemical analyses should be combined to provide a more comprehensive overview on the ecological role of microplastic biofilms. These new microbial niches have so far unknown consequences for microbial ecology and environmental processes in aquatic ecosystems. More knowledge is required on the microbial community composition of microplastic biofilms and their ecological functions in order to better evaluate consequences for the environment and animal health, including humans, especially since the worldwide abundance of microplastics is predicted to dramatically increase.Key Points• Bacteria are mainly studied in community analyses: fungi are neglected.• Microbial colonization of microplastics depends on substrate, location and time.• Community ecology is a promising approach to investigate microbial colonization.• Biodegradable plastics, and ecological roles of microplastic biofilms, need analysis.

## Gallstone Disease and Microbiome.
 05.06.2020, _IN Grigor'eva, TI Romanova_


Gallstone disease (GSD) has, for many years, remained a high-cost, socially significant public health problem. Over the past decade, a number of studies have been carried out-both in humans and in animal models-confirming the role of the microbiota in various sections of the gastrointestinal tract as a new link in the etiopathogenesis of GSD. The microbiome of bile correlates with the bacterial composition of saliva, and the microbiome of the biliary tract has a high similarity with the microbiota of the duodenum. Pathogenic microflora of the oral cavity, through mechanisms of immunomodulation, can affect the motility of the gallbladder and the expression of mucin genes (MUC1,Muc3, MUC4), and represent one of the promoters of stone formation in the gallbladder. The presence of H. pylori infection contributes to the formation of gallstones and affects the occurrence of complications of GSD, including acute and chronic cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis. Intestinal bacteria (Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Eubacterium, and Escherichia coli) participating in the oxidation and epimerization of bile acids can disrupt enterohepatic circulation and lead to the formation of gallstones. At the same time, cholecystectomy due to GSD leads to the further transformation of the composition of the microbiota in various parts of the gastrointestinal tract, increasing the risk of developing stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. Further research is required to determine the possibility of using the evaluation of the composition of the microbiota of the gastrointestinal and biliary tracts as an early diagnostic marker of various gastroenterological diseases.

## Bacterial Peptidoglycans from Microbiota in Neurodevelopment and Behavior.
 08.06.2020, _A Gonzalez-Santana, R Diaz Heijtz_


It is increasingly recognized that the gut microbiota profoundly influences many aspects of host development and physiology, including the modulation of brain development and behavior. However, the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in communication between the microbiota and the developing brain remain to be fully elucidated. Germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize conserved microbial molecular signatures such as bacterial surface molecules (e.g., peptidoglycans, PGNs) have emerged as potential key regulators of gut microbiota-brain interactions. We highlight current evidence supporting multiple and essential roles for PGNs and their sensing molecules beyond innate immunity, extending to neurodevelopment and behavior. In addition, the possible implications of the PGN signaling pathway for the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are considered.

## Comparison of the gut microbiome composition among individuals with acute or long-standing spinal cord injury vs. able-bodied controls.

Objective: Compare the gut microbiome composition among individuals with acute spinal cord injury (A-SCI), long-standing SCI (L-SCI), vs. able-bodied (AB) controls.Design: Cross-sectional study.Setting: The University of Alabama at Birmingham.Participants: Seven adults with A-SCI (36 ± 12 years, 2F/5M, C4-T10, and American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale [AIS] A-D), 25 with L-SCI (46 ± 13 years, 6F/19M, C4-L1, and AIS A-D), and 25 AB controls (42 ± 13 years, 9F/16M).Methods: Stool samples were collected after a median of 7 days and 18 years after injury in the A-SCI and L-SCI groups, respectively. Gut microbiome composition was analyzed using the 16S rRNA sequencing technique and QIIME software. The abundances of bacteria communities among groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test adjusted for age.Results: Several alpha diversity indices were different among groups (Chao1, Observed species, and Phylogenetic Diversity), but not others (Shannon and Simpson). Beta diversity differed among each pair of groups (P &lt; 0.05). A number of microbial communities were differentially abundant among the groups (P &lt; 0.05).Conclusion: Our results revealed differences in the gut microbiome composition among groups. Compared to the AB controls, the SCI groups demonstrated microbiome profiles that shared features linked to metabolic syndrome, inflammation-related bowel disorders, depressive disorders, or antibiotics use, whereas the L-SCI group's microbiome included features linked to reduced physical activity compared to the A-SCI and AB controls. Our results provided preliminary data and a scientific foundation for future studies investigating the impact of the gut microbiome composition on long-term health in individuals with SCI.
