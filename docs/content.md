It is estimated that around 15 million babies are born prematurely every year and approximately one million children die each year due to complications of preterm birth (PTB). Many survivors face a lifetime of disability, including learning disabilities and visual and hearing problems. The current study aimed to characterize Lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal swabs and determine their antibiotic susceptibility.

Mucosal surfaces like those present in the lung, gut, and mouth interface with distinct external environments. These mucosal gateways are not only portals of entry for potential pathogens but homes to microbial communities that impact host health. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is the single most abundant acquired immune component secreted into mucosal surfaces and via the process of immune exclusion, shapes the architecture of these microbiomes. Not all microorganisms at mucosal surfaces are targeted by SIgA, therefore a better understanding of the SIgA-coated fraction may identify the microbial constituents that stimulate host immune responses in the context of health and disease. Chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes are associated with altered microbial communities (dysbiosis) that in turn affect immune-mediated homeostasis. 16S rDNA sequencing of SIgA-coated/uncoated bacteria (IgA-Biome) was conducted on stool and saliva samples of normoglycemic participants and individuals with prediabetes or diabetes (n=8/group). These analyses demonstrated shifts in relative abundance in the IgA-Biome profiles between normoglycemic, prediabetic, or diabetic samples distinct from that of the overall microbiome. Differences in IgA-Biome alpha diversity were apparent for both stool and saliva, while overarching bacterial community differences (beta diversity) were also observed in saliva. These data suggest that IgA-Biome analyses can be used to identify novel microbial signatures associated with diabetes and support the need for further studies exploring these communities. Ultimately, an understanding of the IgA-Biome may promote development of novel strategies to restructure the microbiome as a means of preventing or treating diseases associated with dysbiosis at mucosal surfaces.

## How oral probiotics affect the severity of an experimental model of progressive multiple sclerosis? Bringing commensal bacteria into the neurodegenerative process.

A growing number of studies support that the bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota, the immune system and the CNS are relevant for the pathophysiology of MS. Several studies have reported alterations in the gut microbiome of MS patients. In addition, a variety of studies in animal models of MS have suggested that specific members of the gut commensal microbiota can exacerbate or ameliorate neuroinflammation. Probiotics represent oral nontoxic immunomodulatory agents that would exert benefits when using in combination with current MS therapy. Here we investigate the effect of Vivomixx on the gut microbiome and central and peripheral immune responses in a murine model of primary progressive MS. Vivomixx administration was associated with increased abundance of many taxa such as Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Tenericutes and TM7. This was accompanied by a clear improvement of the motor disability of Theiler's virus infected mice; in the CNS Vivomixx reduced microgliosis, astrogliosis and leukocyte infiltration. Notably, the presence of Breg cells (CD19+CD5+CD1dhigh) in the CNS was enhanced by Vivomixx, and while spinal cord gene expression of IL-1β and IL-6 was diminished, the probiotic promoted IL-10 gene expression. One of the most significant findings was the increased plasma levels of butyrate and acetate levels in TMEV-mice that received Vivomixx. Peripheral immunological changes were subtle but interestingly, the probiotic restricted IL-17 production by Th17-polarized CD4+ T-cells purified from the mesenteric lymph nodes of Theiler's virus infected mice. Our data reinforce the beneficial effects of oral probiotics that would be coadjuvant treatments to current MS therapies.

## General Microbiota of the Soft Tick Ornithodoros turicata Parasitizing the Bolson Tortoise (Gopherus flavomarginatus) in the Mapimi Biosphere Reserve, Mexico.

The general bacterial microbiota of the soft tick Ornithodoros turicata found on Bolson tortoises (Gopherus flavomarginatus) were analyzed using next generation sequencing. The main aims of the study were to establish the relative abundance of bacterial taxa in the tick, and to document the presence of potentially pathogenic species for this tortoise, other animals, and humans. The study was carried-out in the Mapimi Biosphere Reserve in the northern-arid part of Mexico. Bolson tortoises (n = 45) were inspected for the presence of soft ticks, from which 11 tortoises (24.4%) had ticks in low loads (1-3 ticks per individual). Tick pools (five adult ticks each) were analyzed through 16S rRNA V3-V4 region amplification in a MiSeq Illumina, using EzBioCloud as a taxonomical reference. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) revealed 28 phyla, 84 classes, 165 orders, 342 families, 1013 genera, and 1326 species. The high number of taxa registered for O. turicata may be the result of the variety of hosts that this tick parasitizes as they live inside G. flavomarginatus burrows. While the most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, the most abundant species were two endosymbionts of ticks (Midichloria-like and Coxiella-like). Two bacteria documented as pathogenic to Gopherus spp. were registered (Mycoplasma spp. and Pasteurella testudinis). The bovine and ovine tick-borne pathogens A. marginale and A. ovis, respectively, were recorded, as well as the zoonotic bacteria A. phagocytophilum,Coxiella burnetii, and Neoehrlichia sp. Tortoises parasitized with O. turicata did not show evident signs of disease, which could indicate a possible ecological role as a reservoir that has yet to be demonstrated. In fact, the defense mechanisms of this tortoise against the microorganisms transmitted by ticks during their feeding process are still unknown. Future studies on soft ticks should expand our knowledge about what components of the microbiota are notable across multiple host-microbe dynamics. Likewise, studies are required to better understand the host competence of this tortoise, considered the largest terrestrial reptile in North America distributed throughout the Chihuahuan Desert since the late Pleistocene.

Tibetan lake sediments in NW China are sensitive recorders of climate change. However, many important plankton members do not leave any microscopic features in sedimentary records. Here we used ancient DNA preserved in Qinghai Lake sediments to reconstruct the temporal succession of plankton communities in the past 18,500 years. Our results showed that seven classes and sixteen genera of phytoplankton in the lake underwent major temporal changes, in correlation with known climatic events. Trebouxiophyceae and Eustigmatophyceae were predominant during the cold periods, whereas Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae, Xanthophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, and Cyanophyceae were abundant during the warm periods. The inferred changes in temperature, nutrients, precipitation, and salinity, as driven by the Westerlies and summer Monsoon strength, likely contributed to these observed temporal changes. Based on these correlations, we propose the phytoplankton index as a proxy to reconstruct the stadial versus interstadial climate change history in Qinghai Lake. This taxon-specific index is free of terrestrial contamination, sensitive to short-term climatic oscillations, and continuous in recording all climatic events in the lake. The validity of this index and its applicability to other lakes is demonstrated by its good correlations with multiple climate records of Qinghai Lake and another lake on the Tibetan Plateau, Kusai Lake.

## Sulfate-reducing bacterial community shifts in response to acid mine drainage in the sediment of the Hengshi watershed, South China.
 08.09.2020, _Y Bao, X Jin, C Guo, G Lu, Z Dang_


Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are an attractive option for treating acid mine drainage (AMD) and are considered to be of great significance in the natural attenuation of AMD, but the available information regarding the highly diverse SRB community in AMD sites is not comprehensive. The Hengshi River, which is continually contaminated by AMD from upstream mining areas, was selected as a study site for investigation of the distribution, diversity, and abundance of SRB. Overall, high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA and dsrB genes revealed the high diversity, richness, and OTU numbers of SRB communities, suggesting the existence of active sulfate reduction in the study area. Further analysis demonstrated that AMD contamination decreased the richness and diversity of the microbial community and SRB community, and led to spatiotemporal shifts in the overall composition and structure of sediment microbial and SRB communities along the Hengshi watershed. However, the sulfate reduction activity was high in the midstream, even though AMD pollution remained heavy in this area. Spatial distributions of SRB community indicated that species of Clostridia may be more tolerant of AMD contamination than other species, because of their predominance in the SRB communities. In addition, the results of CCA revealed that environmental parameters, such as pH, TS content, and Fe content, can significantly influence total microbial and SRB community structure, and dissolved organic carbon was another important factor structuring the SRB community. This study extends our knowledge of the distribution of indigenous SRB communities and their potential roles in natural AMD attenuation.
