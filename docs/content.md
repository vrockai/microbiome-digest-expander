The gut and oral microbiome is altered in people living with HIV (PLWH). While antiretroviral treatment (ART) is pivotal in restoring immune function in PLWH, several studies have identified an association between specific antiretrovirals, particularly integrase inhibitors (INSTI), and weight gain. In our study, we explored the differences in the oral and gut microbiota of PLWH under different ART regimens, and its correlation to Body Mass Index (BMI). Fecal and salivary samples were collected from PLWH (n = 69) and healthy controls (HC, n = 80). We performed taxonomy analysis to determine the microbial composition and relationship between microbial abundance and ART regimens, BMI, CD4+T-cell count, CD4/CD8 ratio, and ART duration. PLWH showed significantly lower richness compared to HC in both the oral and gut environment. The gut microbiome composition of INSTI-treated individuals was enriched with Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium, whereas non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-treated individuals were enriched with Gordonibacter, Megasphaera, and Staphylococcus. In the oral microenvironment, Veillonella was significantly more abundant in INSTI-treated individuals and Fusobacterium and Alloprevotella in the NNRTI-treated individuals. Furthermore, Bifidobacterium and Dorea were enriched in gut milieu of PLWH with high BMI. Collectively, our findings identify distinct microbial profiles, which are associated with different ART regimens and BMI in PLWH on successful ART, thereby highlighting significant effects of specific antiretrovirals on the microbiome.

## Gut Microbiota and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Neuroinflammatory Mediated Mechanism of Pathogenesis?
 02.08.2024, _F Zarimeidani, R Rahmati, M Mostafavi, M Darvishi, S Khodadadi, M Mohammadi, F Shamlou, S Bakhtiyari, I Alipourfard_


Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social communication and behavior, frequently accompanied by restricted and repetitive patterns of interests or activities. The gut microbiota has been implicated in the etiology of ASD due to its impact on the bidirectional communication pathway known as the gut-brain axis. However, the precise involvement of the gut microbiota in the causation of ASD is unclear. This study critically examines recent evidence to rationalize a probable mechanism in which gut microbiota symbiosis can induce neuroinflammation through intermediator cytokines and metabolites. To develop ASD, loss of the integrity of the intestinal barrier, activation of microglia, and dysregulation of neurotransmitters are caused by neural inflammatory factors. It has emphasized the potential role of neuroinflammatory intermediates linked to gut microbiota alterations in individuals with ASD. Specifically, cytokines like brain-derived neurotrophic factor, calprotectin, eotaxin, and some metabolites and microRNAs have been considered etiological biomarkers. We have also overviewed how probiotic trials may be used as a therapeutic strategy in ASD to reestablish a healthy balance in the gut microbiota. Evidence indicates neuroinflammation induced by dysregulated gut microbiota in ASD, yet there is little clarity based on analysis of the circulating immune profile. It deems the repair of microbiota load would lower inflammatory chaos in the GI tract, correct neuroinflammatory mediators, and modulate the neurotransmitters to attenuate autism. The interaction between the gut and the brain, along with alterations in microbiota and neuroinflammatory biomarkers, serves as a foundational background for understanding the etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder.

## Gut microbiota and eating behaviour in circadian syndrome.
 02.08.2024, _JR Soliz-Rueda, C Cuesta-Marti, SM O'Mahony, G Clarke, H Schellekens, B Muguerza_


Eating behaviour and circadian rhythms are closely related. The type, timing, and quantity of food consumed, and host circadian rhythms, directly influence the intestinal microbiota, which in turn impacts host circadian rhythms and regulates food intake beyond homeostatic eating. This Opinion discusses the impact of food intake and circadian disruptions induced by an obesogenic environment on gut-brain axis signalling. We also explore potential mechanisms underlying the effects of altered gut microbiota on food intake behaviour and circadian rhythmicity. Understanding the crosstalk between gut microbiota, circadian rhythms, and unhealthy eating behaviour is crucial to addressing the obesity epidemic, which remains one of the biggest societal challenges of our time.

The resident microbiome in food industries may impact on food quality and safety. In particular, microbes residing on surfaces in dairy industries may actively participate in cheese fermentation and ripening and contribute to the typical flavor and texture. In this work, we carried out an extensive microbiome mapping in 73 cheese-making industries producing different types of cheeses (fresh, medium and long ripened) and located in 4 European countries. We sequenced and analyzed metagenomes from cheese samples, raw materials and environmental swabs collected from both food contact and non-food contact surfaces, as well as operators' hands and aprons. Dairy plants were shown to harbor a very complex microbiome, characterized by high prevalence of genes potentially involved in flavor development, probiotic activities, and resistance to gastro-intestinal transit, suggesting that these microbes may potentially be transferred to the human gut microbiome. More than 6100 high-quality Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) were reconstructed, including MAGs from several Lactic Acid Bacteria species and putative new species. Although microbial pathogens were not prevalent, we found several MAGs harboring genes related to antibiotic resistance, highlighting that dairy industry surfaces represent a potential hotspot for antimicrobial resistance (AR) spreading along the food chain. Finally, we identified facility-specific strains that can represent clear microbial signatures of different cheesemaking facilities, suggesting an interesting potential of microbiome tracking for the traceability of cheese origin.

## Polyphenols: potent protectors against chronic diseases.
 02.08.2024, _G Shanmugam_


Polyphenols, abundant in plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, wine, and chocolate, offer significant health benefits. Known for their potent antioxidant properties, they combat oxidative stress by neutralising free radicals, crucial in preventing chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, cardiovascular issues, obesity, and diabetes. Polyphenols also exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, modulating gene expression and reducing inflammation associated with NCDs. Their anticancer activities involve inhibiting cancer cell growth and promoting apoptosis through various pathways. They enhance cardiovascular health by improving endothelial function, lowering blood pressure, and inhibiting atherosclerosis. Additionally, polyphenols improve metabolic health by enhancing insulin sensitivity and regulating glucose metabolism, aiding in diabetes and obesity management. These bioactive compounds interact with cellular pathways and gut microbiota, highlighting their multifaceted mechanisms. Integrating polyphenol-rich foods into diets could significantly improve health outcomes and alleviate NCD burdens, advocating for their inclusion in public health strategies and further research to optimise their potential.

Probiotic production in commercial culture media is expensive, so, it is necessary to design culture media based on "low-cost" components like agro-industrial by-products. Therefore, this study aimed to design an agro-industrial by-product-based culture media using whey, sugarcane molasses, and palm kernel cake as components to produce Lactococcus lactis A12, Priestia megaterium M4, and Priestia sp. M10 isolated from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) associated gut microbiota. Higher bacterial concentrations were achieved at high whey concentrations and low concentrations of sugarcane molasses and palm kernel cake (PKC) using agitation. The optimal conditions were whey, 3.84% w/v; sugarcane molasses, 7.39% w/v; PKC, 0.77% w/v; and agitation speed, 75 RPM. Bacterial growth under optimal conditions was compared to that in commercial Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. L. lactis A12 showed similar growth in the optimal media and BHI. The estimated cost of the culture media based on component prices was USD $ 3.01/L, which is 86.93% lower than BHI broth (USD $ 23.04/L). It was possible to design a "low-cost agro-industrial by-product-based culture media to produce L. lactis A12 and the two Priestia species under monoculture conditions.
