Growing literature details the critical importance of the microbiome in the modulation of human health and disease including both the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. Rectovaginal fistulae (RVF) are notoriously difficult to manage, many requiring multiple attempts at repair before correction is achieved. RVF involves two distinct microbiome communities whose characteristics and potential interplay have not been previously characterized and may influence surgical success.

## Alterations of Oral Microbiota in Chinese Patients With Esophageal Cancer.

Emerging evidence supports that oral microbiota are associated with health and diseases of the esophagus. How oral microbiota change in Chinese patients with esophageal cancer (EC) is unknown, neither is their biomarker role. For an objective to understand alterations of oral microbiota in Chinese EC patients, we conducted a case-control study including saliva samples from 39 EC patients and 51 healthy volunteers. 16S rDNA genes of V3-V4 variable regions were sequenced to identify taxon. Relationship between oral flora and disease was analyzed according to alpha diversity and beta diversity. Resultantly, the Shannon index (p = 0.2) and the Simpson diversity index (p = 0.071) were not significant between the two groups. Yet we still found several species different in abundance between the two groups. For the EC group, the most significantly increased taxa were Firmicutes, Negativicutes, Selenomonadales, Prevotellaceae, Prevotella, and Veillonellaceae, while the most significantly decreased taxa were Proteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Neisseriales, Neisseriaceae, and Neisseria. In conclusion, there are significant alterations in abundance of some oral microbiomes between the EC patients and the healthy controls in the studied Chinese participants, which may be meaningful for predicting the development of EC, and the potential roles of these species in EC development deserve further studies.

## Shotgun sequencing of the vaginal microbiome reveals both a species and functional potential signature of preterm birth.

An association between the vaginal microbiota and preterm birth (PTB) has been reported in several research studies. Population shifts from high proportions of lactobacilli to mixed species communities, as seen with bacterial vaginosis, have been linked to a twofold increased risk of PTB. Despite the increasing number of studies using next-generation sequencing technologies, primarily involving 16S rRNA-based approaches, to investigate the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy, no distinct microbial signature has been associated with PTB. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing offers a powerful tool to reveal community structures and their gene functions at a far greater resolution than amplicon sequencing. In this study, we employ shotgun metagenomic sequencing to compare the vaginal microbiota of women at high risk of preterm birth (n = 35) vs. a low-risk control group (n = 14). Although microbial diversity and richness did not differ between groups, there were significant differences in terms of individual species. In particular, Lactobacillus crispatus was associated with samples from a full-term pregnancy, whereas one community state-type was associated with samples from preterm pregnancies. Furthermore, by predicting gene functions, the functional potential of the preterm microbiota was different from that of full-term equivalent. Taken together, we observed a discrete structural and functional difference in the microbial composition of the vagina in women who deliver preterm. Importance: with an estimated 15 million cases annually, spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of death in infants under the age of five years. The ability to accurately identify pregnancies at risk of spontaneous PTB is therefore of utmost importance. However, no single cause is attributable. Microbial infection is a known risk factor, yet the role of vaginal microbes is poorly understood. Using high-resolution DNA-sequencing techniques, we investigate the microbial communities present in the vaginal tracts of women deemed high risk for PTB. We confirm that Lactobacillus crispatus is strongly linked to full-term pregnancies, whereas other microbial communities associate with PTB. Importantly, we show that the specific functions of the microbes present in PTB samples differs from FTB samples, highlighting the power of our sequencing approach. This information enables us to begin understanding the specific microbial traits that may be influencing PTB, beyond the presence or absence of microbial taxa.

## IBDs and the pediatric age: Their peculiarities and the involvement of the microbiota.
 15.11.2020, _L Cococcioni, S Panelli, I Varotto-Boccazzi, DD Carlo, D Pistone, G Leccese, GV Zuccotti, F Comandatore_


Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) are gastrointestinal disorders characterized by chronic, relapsing inflammation, with growing incidence worldwide over the last decades and distinctive features in the pediatric age. An increasing body of evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays a major role in inflammatory disorders, including IBDs. In this review we will discuss the most recent evidences on dysbiotic changes associated with gut inflammation, as well as environmental and genetic factors contributing to IBD pathogenesis, with a focus on the peculiarities of the pediatric age.
