The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to affect the human microbiome in infected and uninfected individuals, having a substantial impact on human health over the long term. This pandemic intersects with a decades-long decline in microbial diversity and ancestral microbes due to hygiene, antibiotics, and urban living (the hygiene hypothesis). High-risk groups succumbing to COVID-19 include those with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, which are also associated with microbiome abnormalities. Current pandemic control measures and practices will have broad, uneven, and potentially long-term effects for the human microbiome across the planet, given the implementation of physical separation, extensive hygiene, travel barriers, and other measures that influence overall microbial loss and inability for reinoculation. Although much remains uncertain or unknown about the virus and its consequences, implementing pandemic control practices could significantly affect the microbiome. In this Perspective, we explore many facets of COVID-19-induced societal changes and their possible effects on the microbiome, and discuss current and future challenges regarding the interplay between this pandemic and the microbiome. Recent recognition of the microbiome's influence on human health makes it critical to consider both how the microbiome, shaped by biosocial processes, affects susceptibility to the coronavirus and, conversely, how COVID-19 disease and prevention measures may affect the microbiome. This knowledge may prove key in prevention and treatment, and long-term biological and social outcomes of this pandemic.

## Exploring the Role of Gut Microbiome in Colon Cancer.
 25.01.2021, _I Chattopadhyay, R Dhar, K Pethusamy, A Seethy, T Srivastava, R Sah, J Sharma, S Karmakar_


Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut microbiota is involved in the metabolic transformations of dietary components into oncometabolites and tumor-suppressive metabolites that in turn affect CRC development. In a healthy colon, the major of microbial metabolism is saccharolytic fermentation pathways. The alpha-bug hypothesis suggested that oncogenic bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) induce the development of CRC through direct interactions with colonic epithelial cells and alterations of microbiota composition at the colorectal site. Escherichia coli, E. faecalis, F. nucleatum, and Streptococcus gallolyticus showed higher abundance whereas Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia showed reduced abundance in CRC patients. The alterations of gut microbiota may be used as potential therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat CRC. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium inhibit the growth of CRC through inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis and enhancing the function of the intestinal barrier through the secretion of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Crosstalk between lifestyle, host genetics, and gut microbiota is well documented in the prevention and treatment of CRC. Future studies are required to understand the interaction between gut microbiota and host to the influence and prevention of CRC. However, a better understanding of bacterial dysbiosis in the heterogeneity of CRC tumors should also be considered. Metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic studies are considered a powerful omic tool to understand the anti-cancer properties of certain bacterial strains. The clinical benefits of probiotics in the CRC context remain to be determined. Metagenomic approaches along with metabolomics and immunology will open a new avenue for the treatment of CRC shortly. Dietary interventions may be suitable to modulate the growth of beneficial microbiota in the gut.

## Tissue-specific control of galectin-1-driven circuits during inflammatory responses.
 26.01.2021, _AM Cutine, CA Bach, F Veigas, JP Merlo, L Laporte, MN Manselle Cocco, M Massaro, N Sarbia, RM Perrotta, YD Mahmoud, GA Rabinovich_


The relevance of glycan-binding protein in immune tolerance and inflammation has been well established, mainly by studies of C-type lectins, siglecs and galectins both in experimental models and patient samples. Galectins, a family of evolutionarily conserved lectins, are characterized by sequence homology in the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), atypical secretion via an ER-Golgi-independent pathway and the ability to recognize Î²-galactoside-containing saccharides. Galectin-1 (Gal-1), a prototype member of this family displays mainly anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, although, similar to many cytokines and growth factors, it may also trigger paradoxical pro-inflammatory effects under certain circumstances. These dual effects could be associated to tissue-, time- or context-dependent regulation of galectin expression and function, including particular pathophysiologic settings and/or environmental conditions influencing the structure of this lectin, as well as the availability of glycosylated ligands in immune cells during the course of inflammatory responses. Here, we discuss the tissue-specific role of Gal-1 as a master regulator of inflammatory responses across different pathophysiologic settings, highlighting its potential role as a therapeutic target. Further studies designed at analyzing the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways that control Gal-1 expression and function in different tissue microenvironments may contribute to design tailored therapeutic strategies aimed at positively or negatively modulate this glycan-binding protein in pathologic inflammatory conditions.

## Microbiota, Epigenetics and Trained Immunity: Convergent Drivers and Mediators of the Asthma Trajectory from Pregnancy to Childhood.
 25.01.2021, _SV Lynch, D Vercelli_


The prevalence of allergy and asthma has increased significantly over the past several decades, especially in industrialized nations where environmental exposures and lifestyles have rapidly diverged from those with which humans evolved. Developing effective interventions for precision treatment and prevention of allergy and asthma requires a deeper understanding of their origins and underlying mechanisms. This Perspective proposes a trans-generational framework for future studies that integrates microbiome, immunology, genetics and epigenetics research in human populations and model systems. We suggest that environmental exposures during pregnancy shape maternal microbiomes and immune function, which in turn influence fetal immune and microbiome development in the context of the child's genetic makeup. Relying on epigenetic mechanisms, these interacting influences train the neonate's innate immune system and regulate its ability to respond to the stimuli provided by microbes vertically transmitted from the mother that initially colonize neonatal body habitats. Depending on their composition and functional properties, these pioneer microbes shape immune function which controls the rate and types of exogenous microbes accumulated into these body habitats during the first year of life, thereby determining trajectories of microbiota development, innate and adaptive immune development, and ultimately asthma risk. One critical implication of the framework we propose is that hitherto independent research tracks should converge to determine how very early life microbes in the context of extrinsic and intrinsic factors direct the accumulation of environmental microbes in early life, and how the composition and metabolic capacity of the child's microbiome at various body habitats, shaped by these interacting influences, controls immune development and asthma risk.

The gut microbiome is altered in cirrhosis. Recent evidence has suggested a key role for the gut microbiota in the progression of cirrhosis and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to study differences in the microbial composition in cirrhotics with prior and future HCC in context of other complications (e.g. infections, hepatic encephalopathy). Two cohorts were recruited prospectively. Prior HCC: Outpatients with HCC within 2 years were age/sex/MELD-matched to those without HCC. Future HCC: Another cohort was followed for 2 years and divided into future HCC vs not after age/sex/MELD-matching and other complications were also recorded. Microbiota composition/predicted function: were analyzed with 16SrRNA Sequencing and PiCRUST and compared between (1) Prior HCC versus none (2) Future HCC versus none. Within future cohort, also between those who developed (a) HCC only versus without complications, (b) HCC only versus non-HCC complications only and (c) HCC+other complications versus non-HCC complications only. 142 men [76 total prior cohort (38 with/38 without HCC), 66 total future cohort (33 with/without future HCC)] were included. Groups had similar etiology, lactulose/rifaximin/PPI use, diabetes, and non-HCC complications. Microbial diversity was similar between prior HCC/not or future HCC/not. On DESeq2 higher Clostridium sensu stricto and Anaerotruncus were significantly associated with protection from HCC while the reverse was seen with Raoultella, and Haemophilus, regardless of prior/future HCC comparisons. Functions focused on urea cycle, bioenergetics, tryptophan, and toluene metabolism were different between groups. Rothia was specific for other complications. CONCLUSION: Despite age, sex and MELD-matching and accounting for other complications, gut microbiota composition and predicted function is different in men with cirrhosis with and without prior HCC and can be extended toward future HCC development.

## Gut microbiota condition the therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer.

Emerging evidence indicates that gut microbiota affect the response to anticancer therapies by modulating the host immune system. In this study, we investigated the impact of the gut microbiota on immune-mediated trastuzumab antitumor efficacy in preclinical models of HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) and in 24 patients with primary HER2-positive BC undergoing trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant treatment. In mice, the antitumor activity of trastuzumab was impaired by antibiotic administration or fecal microbiota transplantation from antibiotic-treated donors. Modulation of the intestinal microbiota was reflected in tumors by impaired recruitment of CD4+ T cells and GZMB+ cells after trastuzumab treatment. Antibiotics caused reductions in dendritic cell (DC) activation and the release of IL12p70 upon trastuzumab treatment, a mechanism that was necessary for trastuzumab effectiveness in our model. In patients, lower Î±-diversity and lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Turicibacteriaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae and Prevotellaceae characterized nonresponsive patients (NR) compared to those who achieved pathological complete response (R), similar to antibiotic-treated mice. The transfer of fecal microbiota from R and NR into mice bearing HER2-positive BC recapitulated the response to trastuzumab observed in patients. Fecal microbiota Î²-diversity segregated patients according to response and positively correlated with immune signature related to interferon, IL12-NO, activated CD4+ T cells and activated DC in tumors. Overall, our data reveal the direct involvement of the gut microbiota in trastuzumab efficacy, suggesting that manipulation of the gut microbiota is an optimal future strategy to achieve a therapeutic effect or to exploit its potential as a biomarker for treatment response.
