Emerging data showed patients with chronic inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, are more likely to develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. This article aims to review the evidence of those associations.

## Salivary microbiome in chronic kidney disease: what is its connection to diabetes, hypertension, and immunity?
 04.09.2022, _F Liu, J Sheng, L Hu, B Zhang, W Guo, Y Wang, Y Gu, P Jiang, H Lin, B Lydia, Y Sun, Y Tang, C Gu, S Wei, Q Zhai, W Chen, N Feng_


The association between oral dysbiosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has gained increasing attention in recent years. Diabetes and hypertension are the most common conditions in CKD. However, a case-control study with matched confounding variables on the salivary microbiome in CKD and the influence of diabetes and hypertension on the microbiome has never been reported.

## Does exposure to different types of menstrual protections affect the vaginal environment?
 04.09.2022, _N Tessandier, IB Uysal, B Elie, C Selinger, C Bernat, V Boué, S Grasset, S Groc, M Rahmoun, B Reyné, N Bender, M Bonneau, C Graf, V Tribout, V Foulongne, J Ravel, T Waterboer, C Hirtz, IG Bravo, J Reynes, M Segondy, CL Murall, N Boulle, T Kamiya, S Alizon_


The vaginal ecosystem is a key component of women's health. It also represents an ideal system for ecologists to investigate the consequence of perturbations on species diversity and emerging properties between organisational levels. Here, we study how exposure to different types of menstrual protection products is linked to microbial, immunological, demographic, and behavioural measurements in a cohort of young adult women who reported using more often tampons (n = 107) or menstrual cups (n = 31). We first found that cup users were older and smoked less than tampon users. When analysing health indicators, we detected potential associations between cups use reporting and fungal genital infection. A multivariate analysis confirmed that, in our cohort, reporting using cups over tampons was associated with the higher odds ratio to report a fungal genital infection diagnosis by a medical doctor within the last 3 months. We did not detect significant differences between groups in terms of their bacterial vaginal microbiota composition and found marginal differences in the level of expression of 20 cytokines. However, a multivariate analysis of these biological data identified some level of clustering based on the type of menstrual production preferred (cups or tampons). These results suggest that exposure to different types of menstrual products could influence menstrual health. Larger studies and studies with a more powered setting are needed to assess the robustness of these associations and identify causal mechanisms.

## A shared mucosal gut microbiota signature in primary sclerosing cholangitis before and after liver transplantation.

Several characteristic features of the fecal microbiota have been described in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), while data on mucosal microbiota are less consistent. We aimed to utilize a large colonoscopy cohort to investigate key knowledge gaps, including the role of gut microbiota in PSC with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the effect of liver transplantation (LT), and whether recurrent PSC (rPSC) may be used to define consistent microbiota features in PSC irrespective of LT.

## Comparative biology of germ-free and conventional poultry.
 03.09.2022, _AJ Cowieson_


Interaction between the host and the enteric microbiome is highly complex. Microbial involvement in certain pathologies is moderately well established, but the contribution of the microbiome to animal welfare, behavior, sustainability, immune development, nutritional status, physiology, and maturation is less clear. A valuable experimental model to enable scientists to explore the role of the microbiome in various domains is to compare various phenotypes of a conventionally reared (CV) cohort with those in a germ-free (GF) state. A GF animal is one that is devoid of any detectable microbial life including bacteria, viruses, protozoa and parasites. The GF state is different from gnotobiotic animals where the microbiome is fully described, or 'specific pathogen free' (SPF) animals where a moderately normal microbiome is present but devoid of pathogenic microorganisms. Pioneering GF research in poultry in the late 1940s and 1950s has its origin in a need understand the mode of action of antibiotics. Early researchers quickly established that GF chicks responded differently to antibiotics than CV counterparts. The GF experimental model has since been exploited in many divergent fields including pathology, immunology, metabolism, anatomy, physiology, and others. The absence of a microbiome presents the host with a range of advantages and disadvantages. For example, GF chicks often grow more quickly and have lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) than their CV counterparts but may be less resilient to external stress and have a compromised immunological maturation rate. This review will summarize the literature on GF animal research with a special emphasis on poultry. The objective of the review is to establish a frame of reference to understand the extent of the role of the microbiome in animal health, welfare, nutrition, and growth, to provide opportunities for targeted modulation of the microbiome to achieve desired phenotypic responses whilst simultaneously minimizing unintended collateral effects.

We examined the effects of a mixture of contaminants found in agricultural watersheds on the gut microbiota and physiology of both the freshwater mussel Lampsilis cardium, and L. cardium host fish Micropterus salmoides.
