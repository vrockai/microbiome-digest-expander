## Intestinal Bacteriophage Therapy: Looking for Optimal Efficacy.
 20.10.2021, _F Javaudin, C Latour, L Debarbieux, Q Lamy-Besnier_


Several human intestinal microbiota studies suggest that bacteriophages, viruses infecting bacteria, play a role in gut homeostasis. Currently, bacteriophages are considered a tool to precisely engineer the intestinal microbiota, but they have also attracted considerable attention as a possible solution to fight against bacterial pathogens resistant to antibiotics. These two applications necessitate bacteriophages to reach and kill their bacterial target within the gut environment. Unfortunately, exploitable clinical data in this field are scarce. Here, we review the administration of bacteriophages to target intestinal bacteria in mammalian experimental models. While bacteriophage amplification in the gut was often confirmed, we found that in most studies, it had no significant impact on the load of the targeted bacteria. In particular, we observed that the outcome of bacteriophage treatments is linked to the behavior of the target bacteria toward each animal model. Treatment efficacy ranges from poor in asymptomatic intestinal carriage to high in intestinal disease. This broad range of efficacy underlines the difficulties to reach a consensus on the impact of bacteriophages in the gut and calls for deeper investigations of key parameters that influence the success of such interventions before launching clinical trials.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are gut symbionts that can be used as a model to understand the host-microbiota crosstalk under unpredictable environmental conditions such as wildlife ecosystems. The aim of this study was to determine whether viable LAB can be informative of the health status of wild boar populations. We monitored the genotype and phenotype of LAB based on markers that included safety and phylogenetic origin, antibacterial activity and immunomodulatory properties. A LAB profile dominated by lactobacilli appears to stimulate protective immune responses and relates to strains widely used as probiotics, resulting in a potentially healthy wildlife population whereas microbiota overpopulated by enterococci was observed in a hostile environment. These enterococci were closely related to pathogenic strains that have developed mechanisms to evade innate immune system, posing a potential risk for the host health. Furthermore, our LAB isolates displayed antibacterial properties in a species-dependent manner. Nearly all of them were able to inhibit bacterial pathogens, raising the possibility of using them as a la carte antibiotic alternative in the unexplored field of wildlife disease mitigation. Our study highlights that microbiological characterization of LAB is a useful indicator of wildlife health status and the ecological origin from which they derive. Significance Statement The wildlife symbiotic microbiota is an important component to the greater for greater diversity and functionality of their bacterial populations, influencing the host health and adaptability to its ecosystem. Although many microbes are partly responsible for the development of multiple physiological processes, only certain bacterial groups such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have the capacity to overpopulate the gut, promoting health (or disease) when specific genetic and environmental conditions are present. LAB have been exploited in many ways due to their probiotic properties, in particular lactobacilli, however their relationship with wildlife gut-associated microbiota hosts remains to be elucidated. On the other hand, it is unclear whether LAB such as enterococci, which have been associated with detrimental health effects, could lead to disease. These important questions have not been properly addressed in the field of wildlife, and therefore, should be clearly attained.

## High-coverage metabolomics uncovers microbiota-driven biochemical landscape of interorgan transport and gut-brain communication in mice.
 20.10.2021, _Y Lai, CW Liu, Y Yang, YC Hsiao, H Ru, K Lu_


The mammalian gut harbors a complex and dynamic microbial ecosystem: the microbiota. While emerging studies support that microbiota regulates brain function with a few molecular cues suggested, the overall biochemical landscape of the "microbiota-gut-brain axis" remains largely unclear. Here we use high-coverage metabolomics to comparatively profile feces, blood sera, and cerebral cortical brain tissues of germ-free C57BL/6 mice and their age-matched conventionally raised counterparts. Results revealed for all three matrices metabolomic signatures owing to microbiota, yielding hundreds of identified metabolites including 533 altered for feces, 231 for sera, and 58 for brain with numerous significantly enriched pathways involving aromatic amino acids and neurotransmitters. Multicompartmental comparative analyses single out microbiota-derived metabolites potentially implicated in interorgan transport and the gut-brain axis, as exemplified by indoxyl sulfate and trimethylamine-N-oxide. Gender-specific characteristics of these landscapes are discussed. Our findings may be valuable for future research probing microbial influences on host metabolism and gut-brain communication.
