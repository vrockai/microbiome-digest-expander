## Endothelium-gut communication: IGF-1Rs crosstalk with microbiota.
 03.05.2021, _Z Bouman Chen, N Kaur Malhi_


The gut, with its extensive microbiota, plays a fundamental role in metabolism. While alterations of the gut microbiota can induce dysfunction of the endothelium, it remains unclear whether the endothelium can directly impact the gut microbiota. To answer this question, in this issue of EMBO Reports Haywood and colleagues deployed a murine model with endothelial-specific overexpression of human insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), termed hIGFREO mice (Haywood et al, 2021). When fed a high-fat diet, hIGFREO mice gained less weight and adiposity, with improved glucose tolerance, as compared to their wild-type littermates. Such protection was attributed to the difference in gut microbiota, exemplified by an increase in the beneficial genus Akkermansia. Furthermore, depletion of microbiota through broad-spectrum antibiotics nullified the advantageous metabolic phenotype observed. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a novel communication axis between the endothelium and the gut wall, specifically through endothelial IGF-1R modulation of gut microbiota, that promotes whole body metabolic homeostasis.

## Recent advances in marine algae oligosaccharides: structure, analysis, and potential prebiotic activities.
 03.05.2021, _XT Xie, KL Cheong_


Marine algae contain abundant polysaccharides that support a range of health-promoting activities; however, the high molecular weight, high viscosity, and low solubility of marine algae polysaccharides (MAPs) limit their application in food, agriculture and medicine. Thus, as the degradation products of MAPs, marine algae oligosaccharides (MAOs) have drawn increasing attention. Most MAOs are non-digestible by digestive enzyme in the human gastrointestinal tract, but are fermented by bacteria in the gut and converted into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). MAOs can selectively enhance the activities of some populations of beneficial bacteria and stimulate a series of prebiotic effects, such as anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-tumour. However, the exact structures of MAOs and their prebiotic activities are, to a large extent, unexplored. This review summarizes recent advances in the sources, categories, and structure analysis methods of MAOs, emphasizing their effects on gut microbiota and its metabolite SCFAs as well as the resulting range of probiotic activities.

## Interplay between diet and gut microbiome, and circulating concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide: findings from a longitudinal cohort of US men.
 30.04.2021, _J Li, Y Li, KL Ivey, DD Wang, JE Wilkinson, A Franke, KH Lee, A Chan, C Huttenhower, FB Hu, EB Rimm, Q Sun_


Gut-produced trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is postulated as a possible link between red meat intake and poor cardiometabolic health. We investigated whether gut microbiome could modify associations of dietary precursors with TMAO concentrations and cardiometabolic risk markers among free-living individuals.

## Gut Dysbiosis Associated with Antibiotics and Disease Severity and Its Relation to Mortality in Critically Ill Patients.

The gut microbiota are reported to be altered in critical illness. The pattern and impact of dysbiosis on prognosis has not been thoroughly investigated in the ICU setting.

## Effects of Totum-63 on glucose homeostasis and post-prandial glycemia: a translational study.
 03.05.2021, _V Chavanelle, YF Otero, F Le Joubioux, D Ripoche, M Bargetto, A Vluggens, C Montaurier, G Pickering, G Ducheix, C Dubray, C Dualé, S Boulliau, N Macian, G Marceau, V Sapin, F Dutheil, B Guigas, T Maugard, N Boisseau, M Cazaubiel, SL Peltier, P Sirvent_


Global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rising and may affect 700 million people by 2045. Totum-63 is a polyphenol-rich natural composition developed to reduce the risk of T2D. We first investigated the effects of Totum-63 supplementation in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice for up to 16 weeks, and thereafter assessed its safety and efficacy (2.5 g or 5 g per day) in 14 overweight men (mean age 51.5 years, BMI 27.6 kg.m-2) for 4 weeks. In HFD-fed mice, Totum-63 reduced body weight and fat mass gain while lean mass was unchanged. Moreover, fecal energy excretion was higher in Totum-63 supplemented mice, suggesting a reduction of calorie absorption in the digestive tract. In the gut, metagenomic analyses of fecal microbiota revealed a partial restoration of HFD-induced microbial imbalance, as shown by PCoA analysis of microbiota composition. HFD-induced increase in HOMA-IR score was delayed in supplemented mice, and insulin response to an OGTT was significantly reduced, suggesting that Totum-63 may prevent HFD-related impairments in glucose homeostasis. Interestingly, these improvements could be linked to restored insulin signaling in subcutaneous adipose tissue and soleus muscle. In the liver, HFD-induced steatosis was reduced by 40% (as shown by triglyceride content). In the subsequent study in men, Totum-63 (5g.day-1) improved glucose and insulin responses to a high-carbohydrate breakfast test (84% kcal carbohydrates). It was well tolerated, with no clinically significant adverse events reported. Collectively, these data suggest that Totum-63 could improve glucose homeostasis in both HFD-fed mice and overweight individuals, presumably through a multi-targeted action on different metabolic organs.
