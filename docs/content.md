The maintenance of human health is dependent on a symbiotic relationship between humans and associated bacteria. The diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes vary widely among body areas and among them the oral microbiome plays a key role. Significant changes in the oral cavity, predominantly at salivary and periodontal level, have been associated with changes in estrogen levels. However, whether the oral microbiome is affected by hormonal level alterations is understudied. Hence the main objective pursued by AMICA project was to characterize the oral microbiome (saliva) in healthy women through: profiling studies using "omics" technologies (NMR-based metabolomics, targeted lipidomics by LC-MS, metagenomics by NGS); SinglePlex ELISA assays; glycosidase activity analyses and bioinformatic analysis. For this purpose, thirty-nine medically healthy women aged 26-77 years (19 with menstrual cycle and 20 in menopause) were recruited. Participants completed questionnaires assessing detailed medical and medication history and demographic characteristics. Plasmatic and salivary levels of sexual hormones were assessed (FSH, estradiol, LH and progesteron) at day 3 and 14 for women with menstrual cycle and only once for women in menopause. Salivary microbiome composition was assessed through meta-taxonomic 16S sequencing and overall, the salivary microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle and in menopause. Targeted lipidomics and untargeted metabolomics profiling were assessed through the use of LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy technologies, respectively and significant changes in terms of metabolites were identified in saliva of post-menopausal women in comparison to cycle. Moreover, glycosyl hydrolase activities were screened and showed that the β-D-hexosaminidase activity was the most present among those analyzed. Although this study has not identified significant alterations in the composition of the oral microbiome, multiomics analysis have revealed a strong correlation between 2-AG and α-mannosidase. In conclusion, the use of a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the oral microbiome of healthy women provided some indication about microbiome-derived predictive biomarkers that could be used in the future for developing new strategies to help to re-establish the correct hormonal balance in post-menopausal women.

## Multidisciplinary Perinatal Care in IBD.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are often affected during their reproductive years and may have many perinatal queries that require the comprehensive perspectives of a multidisciplinary team [MDT]. The purpose of this topical review is to assess the scientific evidence and provide expert opinion related to nutritional, psychological, and supportive care of women and their infants throughout the prenatal, antenatal, and infant periods.

## A multi-omic brain gut microbiome signature differs between IBS subjects with different bowel habits.

Alterations of the brain-gut-microbiome system (BGM) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), yet bowel habit-specific alterations have not been elucidated. In this cross-sectional study, we apply a systems biology approach to characterize BGM patterns related to predominant bowel habit. Fecal samples and resting state fMRI were obtained from 102 premenopausal women (36 constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), 27 diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 39 healthy controls (HCs)). Data integration analysis using latent components (DIABLO) was used to integrate data from the phenome, microbiome, metabolome, and resting-state connectome to predict HCs vs IBS-C vs IBS-D. Bloating and visceral sensitivity, distinguishing IBS from HC, were negatively associated with beneficial microbes and connectivity involving the orbitofrontal cortex. This suggests that gut interactions may generate aberrant central autonomic and descending pain pathways in IBS. The connection between IBS symptom duration, key microbes, and caudate connectivity may provide mechanistic insight to the chronicity of pain in IBS. IBS-D had higher levels of many key metabolites including tryptophan and phenylalanine, and increased connectivity between the sensorimotor and default mode networks; thus, suggesting an influence on diarrhea, self-related thoughts, and pain perception in IBS-D ('bottom-up' mechanism). IBS-C's microbiome and metabolome resembled HCs, but had increased connectivity in the default mode and salience networks compared to IBS-D, which may indicate importance of visceral signals, suggesting a more 'top-down' BGM pathophysiology. These BGM characteristics highlight possible mechanistic differences for variations in the IBS bowel habit phenome.

## RIAM: A Universal Accessible Protocol for the Isolation of High Purity DNA from Various Soils and Other Humic Substances.

A single universal open protocol RIAM (named after Research Institute for Agricultural Microbiology) for the isolation of high purity DNA from different types of soils and other substrates (high and low in humic, clay content, organic fertilizer, etc.) is proposed. The main features of the RIAM protocol are the absence of the sorption-desorption stage on silica columns, the use of high concentrations of phosphate in buffers, which prevents DNA sorption on minerals, and DNA precipitation using CTAB. The performance of RIAM was compared with a reference commercial kit and showed very good results in relation to the purity and quantity of DNA, as well as the absence of inhibitory activity on PCR. In all cases, the RIAM ensured the isolation of DNA in quantities much greater than the commercial kit without the effect of PCR inhibition up to 50 ng DNA per reaction in a volume of 15 µL. The latter circumstance along with the ability of the protocol to extract low molecular weight DNA fractions makes the method especially suitable for those cases where quantitative assessments, detection of minor components of soil microbiota, and completeness of isolation of all DNA fractions are required.

## Compositionality, sparsity, spurious heterogeneity, and other data-driven challenges for machine learning algorithms within plant microbiome studies.
 20.12.2022, _S Busato, M Gordon, M Chaudhari, I Jensen, T Akyol, S Andersen, C Williams_


The plant-associated microbiome is a key component of plant systems, contributing to their health, growth, and productivity. The application of machine learning (ML) in this field promises to help untangle the relationships involved. However, measurements of microbial communities by high-throughput sequencing pose challenges for ML. Noise from low sample sizes, soil heterogeneity, and technical factors can impact the performance of ML. Additionally, the compositional and sparse nature of these datasets can impact the predictive accuracy of ML. We review recent literature from plant studies to illustrate that these properties often go unmentioned. We expand our analysis to other fields to quantify the degree to which mitigation approaches improve the performance of ML and describe the mathematical basis for this. With the advent of accessible analytical packages for microbiome data including learning models, researchers must be familiar with the nature of their datasets.
