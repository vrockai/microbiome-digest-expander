## Pyruvate secretion by oral streptococci modulates hydrogen peroxide dependent antagonism.
 22.04.2020, _S Redanz, P Treerat, R Mu, U Redanz, Z Zou, D Koley, J Merritt, J Kreth_


Many commensal oral streptococci generate H2O2 via pyruvate oxidase (SpxB) to inhibit the growth of competing bacteria like Streptococcus mutans, a major cariogenic species. In Streptococcus sanguinis SK36 (SK36) and Streptococcus gordonii DL1 (DL1), spxB expression and H2O2 release are subject to carbon catabolite repression by the catabolite control protein A (CcpA). Surprisingly, ccpA deletion mutants of SK36 and DL1 fail to inhibit S. mutans despite their production of otherwise inhibitory levels of H2O2. Using H2O2-deficient spxB deletion mutants of SK36 and DL1, it was subsequently discovered that both strains confer protection in trans to other bacteria when H2O2 is added exogenously. This protective effect depends on the direct detoxification of H2O2 by the release of pyruvate. The pyruvate dependent protective effect is also present in other spxB-encoding streptococci, such as the pneumococcus, but is missing from spxB-negative species like S. mutans. Targeted and transposon-based mutagenesis revealed Nox (putative H2O-forming NADH dehydrogenase) as an essential component required for pyruvate release and oxidative protection, while other genes such as sodA and dps play minor roles. Furthermore, pyruvate secretion is only detectable in aerobic growth conditions at biofilm-like cell densities and is responsive to CcpA-dependent catabolite control. This ability of spxB-encoding streptococci reveals a new facet of the competitive interactions between oral commensals and pathobionts and provides a mechanistic basis for the variable levels of inhibitory potential observed among H2O2-producing strains of commensal oral streptococci.

## Synergism between Corynebacterium and Streptococcus sanguinis reveals new interactions between oral commensals.
 22.04.2020, _P Treerat, U Redanz, S Redanz, RA Giacaman, J Merritt, J Kreth_


The oral microbiome engages in a diverse array of highly sophisticated ecological interactions that are crucial for maintaining symbiosis with the host. Streptococci and corynebacteria are among the most abundant oral commensals and their interactions are critical for normal biofilm development. In this study, we discovered that Streptococcus sanguinis specifically responds to the presence of Corynebacterium durum by dramatically altering its chain morphology and improving its overall fitness. By employing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, specific fatty acids were identified in C. durum supernatants that are responsible for the observed effect. Membrane vesicles (MVs) containing these fatty acids were isolated from C. durum supernatants and were able to replicate the chain morphology phenotype in S. sanguinis, suggesting MV as a mediator of interspecies interactions. Furthermore, S. sanguinis responds to C. durum lipids by decreasing the expression of key FASII genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. Several of these genes are also essential for the chain elongation phenotype, which implicates a regulatory connection between lipid metabolism and chain elongation. In addition, C. durum was found to affect the growth, cell aggregation, and phagocytosis of S. sanguinis, revealing a complex association of these species that likely supports oral commensal colonization and survival.

## The gut microbiota response to helminth infection depends on host sex and genotype.
 22.04.2020, _F Ling, N Steinel, J Weber, L Ma, C Smith, D Correa, B Zhu, D Bolnick, G Wang_


Vertebrates' gut microbial communities can be altered by the hosts' parasites. Helminths inhabiting the gut lumen can interact directly with their host's microbiota via physical contact, chemical products, or competition for nutrients. Indirect interactions can also occur, for instance when helminths induce or suppress host immunity in ways that have collateral effects on the microbiota. If there is genetic variation in host immune responses to parasites, we would expect such indirect effects to be conditional on host genotype. To test for such genotype by infection interactions, we experimentally exposed Gasterosteus aculeatus to their naturally co-evolved parasite, Schistocephalus solidus. The host microbiota differed in response to parasite exposure, and between infected and uninfected fish. The magnitude and direction of microbial responses to infection differed between host sexes, and also differed between variants at autosomal quantitative trait loci. These results indicate that host genotype and sex regulate the effect of helminth infection on a vertebrate gut microbiota. If this result holds in other taxa, especially humans, then helminth-based therapeutics for dysbiosis might need to be tailored to host genotype and sex.

## Comparative genomics: Dominant coral-bacterium Endozoicomonas acroporae metabolizes dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP).
 22.04.2020, _K Tandon, CY Lu, PW Chiang, N Wada, SH Yang, YF Chan, PY Chen, HY Chang, YJ Chiou, MS Chou, WM Chen, SL Tang_


Dominant coral-associated Endozoicomonas bacteria species are hypothesized to play a role in the coral sulfur cycle by metabolizing dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) into dimethylsulfide (DMS); however, no sequenced genome to date harbors genes for this process. In this study, we assembled high-quality (&gt;95% complete) draft genomes of strains of the recently added species Endozoicomonas acroporae (Acr-14T, Acr-1, and Acr-5) isolated from the coral Acropora sp. and performed a comparative genomic analysis on the genus Endozoicomonas. We identified DMSP CoA-transferase/lyase-a dddD gene homolog in all sequenced genomes of E. acroporae strains-and functionally characterized bacteria capable of metabolizing DMSP into DMS via the DddD cleavage pathway using RT-qPCR and gas chromatography (GC). Furthermore, we demonstrated that E. acroporae strains can use DMSP as a carbon source and have genes arranged in an operon-like manner to link DMSP metabolism to the central carbon cycle. This study confirms the role of Endozoicomonas in the coral sulfur cycle.

## Active sulfur cycling in the terrestrial deep subsurface.
 22.04.2020, _E Bell, T Lamminmäki, J Alneberg, AF Andersson, C Qian, W Xiong, RL Hettich, M Frutschi, R Bernier-Latmani_


The deep terrestrial subsurface remains an environment where there is limited understanding of the extant microbial metabolisms. At Olkiluoto, Finland, a deep geological repository is under construction for the final storage of spent nuclear fuel. It is therefore critical to evaluate the potential impact microbial metabolism, including sulfide generation, could have upon the safety of the repository. We investigated a deep groundwater where sulfate is present, but groundwater geochemistry suggests limited microbial sulfate-reducing activity. Examination of the microbial community at the genome-level revealed microorganisms with the metabolic capacity for both oxidative and reductive sulfur transformations. Deltaproteobacteria are shown to have the genetic capacity for sulfate reduction and possibly sulfur disproportionation, while Rhizobiaceae, Rhodocyclaceae, Sideroxydans, and Sulfurimonas oxidize reduced sulfur compounds. Further examination of the proteome confirmed an active sulfur cycle, serving for microbial energy generation and growth. Our results reveal that this sulfide-poor groundwater harbors an active microbial community of sulfate-reducing and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, together mediating a sulfur cycle that remained undetected by geochemical monitoring alone. The ability of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria to limit the accumulation of sulfide was further demonstrated in groundwater incubations and highlights a potential sink for sulfide that could be beneficial for geological repository safety.

## Mixotrophy in marine picocyanobacteria: use of organic compounds by Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus.
 22.04.2020, _MC Muñoz-Marín, G Gómez-Baena, A López-Lozano, JA Moreno-Cabezuelo, J Díez, JM García-Fernández_


Marine picocyanobacteria of the Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus genera have been longtime considered as autotrophic organisms. However, compelling evidence published over the last 15 years shows that these organisms can use different organic compounds containing key elements to survive in oligotrophic oceans, such as N (amino acids, amino sugars), S (dimethylsulfoniopropionate, DMSP), or P (ATP). Furthermore, marine picocyanobacteria can also take up glucose and use it as a source of carbon and energy, despite the fact that this compound is devoid of limiting elements and can also be synthesized by using standard metabolic pathways. This review will outline the main findings suggesting mixotrophy in the marine picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, and its ecological relevance for these important primary producers.

## Vargas: heuristic-free alignment for assessing linear and graph read aligners.
 22.04.2020, _CA Darby, R Gaddipati, MC Schatz, B Langmead_


Read alignment is central to many aspects of modern genomics. Most aligners use heuristics to accelerate processing, but these heuristics can fail to find the optimal alignments of reads. Alignment accuracy is typically measured through simulated reads; however, the simulated location may not be the (only) location with the optimal alignment score.
