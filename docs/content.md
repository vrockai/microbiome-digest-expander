## Multiomics and digital monitoring during lifestyle changes reveal independent dimensions of human biology and health.
 02.12.2021, _F Marabita, T James, A Karhu, H Virtanen, K Kettunen, H Stenlund, F Boulund, C Hellström, M Neiman, R Mills, T Perheentupa, H Laivuori, P Helkkula, M Byrne, I Jokinen, H Honko, A Kallonen, M Ermes, H Similä, M Lindholm, E Widén, S Ripatti, M Perälä-Heape, L Engstrand, P Nilsson, T Moritz, T Miettinen, R Sallinen, O Kallioniemi_


We explored opportunities for personalized and predictive health care by collecting serial clinical measurements, health surveys, genomics, proteomics, autoantibodies, metabolomics, and gut microbiome data from 96 individuals who participated in a data-driven health coaching program over a 16-month period with continuous digital monitoring of activity and sleep. We generated a resource of &gt;20,000 biological samples from this study and a compendium of &gt;53 million primary data points for 558,032 distinct features. Multiomics factor analysis revealed distinct and independent molecular factors linked to obesity, diabetes, liver function, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, immunity, exercise, diet, and hormonal effects. For example, ethinyl estradiol, a common oral contraceptive, produced characteristic molecular and physiological effects, including increased levels of inflammation and impact on thyroid, cortisol levels, and pulse, that were distinct from other sources of variability observed in our study. In total, this work illustrates the value of combining deep molecular and digital monitoring of human health. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

## A specific structure and high richness characterize intestinal microbiota of HIV-exposed seronegative individuals.
 02.12.2021, _TJ Lopera, JA Lujan, E Zurek, W Zapata, JC Hernandez, MA Toro, JF Alzate, NA Taborda, MT Rugeles, W Aguilar-Jimenez_


Intestinal microbiota facilitates food breakdown for energy metabolism and influences the immune response, maintaining mucosal homeostasis. Overall, HIV infection is associated with intestinal dysbiosis and immune activation, which has been related to seroconversion in HIV-exposed individuals. However, it is unclear whether microbiota dysbiosis is the cause or the effect of immune alterations and disease progression or if it could modulate the risk of acquiring the HIV infection. We characterize the intestinal microbiota and determine its association with immune regulation in HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESN), HIV-infected progressors (HIV+), and healthy control (HC) subjects. For this, feces and blood were collected. The microbiota composition of HESN showed a significantly higher alpha (p = 0.040) and beta diversity (p = 0.006) compared to HC, but no differences were found compared to HIV+. A lower Treg percentage was observed in HESN (1.77%) than HC (2.98%) and HIV+ (4.02%), with enrichment of the genus Butyrivibrio (p = 0.029) being characteristic of this profile. Moreover, we found that Megasphaera (p = 0.017) and Victivallis (p = 0.0029) also are enriched in the microbiota composition in HESN compared to HC and HIV+ subjects. Interestingly, an increase in Succinivibrio and Prevotella, and a reduction in Bacteroides genus, which is typical of HIV-infected individuals, were observed in both HESN and HIV+, compared to HC. Thus, HESNs have a microbiota profile, similar to that observed in HIV+, most likely because HESN are cohabiting with their HIV+ partners.

## Central role of intestinal epithelial glucocorticoid receptor in alcohol- and corticosterone-induced gut permeability and systemic response.
 03.12.2021, _PK Shukla, AS Meena, JF Pierre, R Rao_


Corticosterone, the stress hormone, exacerbates alcohol-associated tissue injury, but the mechanism involved is unknown. We examined the role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in corticosterone-mediated potentiation of alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction and systemic response. Hepatocyte-specific GR-deficient (GRΔHC ) and intestinal epithelial-specific GR-deficient (GRΔIEC ) mice were fed ethanol, combined with corticosterone treatment. Intestinal epithelial tight junction integrity, mucosal barrier function, microbiota dysbiosis, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, liver damage, and neuroinflammation were assessed. Corticosterone potentiated ethanol-induced epithelial tight junction disruption, mucosal permeability, and inflammatory response in GRΔHC mouse colon; these effects of ethanol and corticosterone were absent in GRΔIEC mice. Gut microbiota compositions in ethanol-fed GRΔHC and GRΔIEC mice were similar to each other. However, corticosterone treatment in ethanol-fed mice shifted the microbiota composition to distinctly different directions in GRΔHC and GRΔIEC mice. Ethanol and corticosterone synergistically elevated the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli and reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus in GRΔHC mice but not in GRΔIEC mice. In GRΔHC mice, corticosterone potentiated ethanol-induced endotoxemia and systemic inflammation, but these effects were absent in GRΔIEC mice. Interestingly, ethanol-induced liver damage and its potentiation by corticosterone were observed in GRΔHC mice but not in GRΔIEC mice. GRΔIEC mice were also resistant to ethanol- and corticosterone-induced inflammatory response in the hypothalamus. These data indicate that the intestinal epithelial GR plays a central role in alcohol- and corticosterone-induced gut barrier dysfunction, microbiota dysbiosis, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, liver damage, and neuroinflammation. This study identifies a novel target for potential therapeutic for alcohol-associated tissue injury.

## Proof-of-principle demonstration of endogenous circadian system and circadian misalignment effects on human oral microbiota.
 03.12.2021, _SL Chellappa, PA Engen, A Naqib, J Qian, N Vujovic, N Rahman, SJ Green, M Garaulet, A Keshavarzian, FAJL Scheer_


Circadian misalignment-the misalignment between the central circadian "clock" and behavioral and environmental cycles (including sleep/wake, fasting/eating, dark/light)-results in adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects. Potential underlying mechanisms for these adverse effects include alterations in the orogastrointestinal microbiota. However, it remains unknown whether human oral microbiota has endogenous circadian rhythms (i.e., independent of sleep/wake, fasting/eating, and dark/light cycles) and whether circadian misalignment influences oral microbiota community composition. Healthy young individuals [27.3 ± 2.3 years (18-35 years), 4 men and 2 women, body-mass index range: 18-28 kg/m2 ] were enrolled in a stringently controlled 14-day circadian laboratory protocol. This included a 32-h constant routine (CR) protocol (endogenous circadian baseline assessment), a forced desynchrony protocol with four 28-h "days" under ~3 lx to induce circadian misalignment, and a post-misalignment 40-h CR protocol. Microbiota assessments were performed on saliva samples collected every 4 h throughout both CR protocols. Total DNA was extracted and processed using high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. The relative abundance of specific oral microbiota populations, i.e., one of the five dominant phyla, and three of the fourteen dominant genera, exhibited significant endogenous circadian rhythms. Importantly, circadian misalignment dramatically altered the oral microbiota landscape, such that four of the five dominant phyla and eight of the fourteen dominant genera exhibited significant circadian misalignment effects. Moreover, circadian misalignment significantly affected the metagenome functional content of oral microbiota (inferred gene content analysis), as indicated by changes in specific functional pathways associated with metabolic control and immunity. Collectively, our proof-of-concept study provides evidence for endogenous circadian rhythms in human oral microbiota and show that even relatively short-term experimental circadian misalignment can dramatically affect microbiota community composition and functional pathways involved in metabolism and immune function. These proof-of-principle findings have translational relevance to individuals typically exposed to circadian misalignment, including night shift workers and frequent flyers.

## Gut microbiota-driven brain Aβ amyloidosis in mice requires microglia.
 03.12.2021, _HB Dodiya, HL Lutz, IQ Weigle, P Patel, J Michalkiewicz, CJ Roman-Santiago, CM Zhang, Y Liang, A Srinath, X Zhang, J Xia, M Olszewski, X Zhang, MJ Schipma, EB Chang, RE Tanzi, JA Gilbert, SS Sisodia_


We previously demonstrated that lifelong antibiotic (ABX) perturbations of the gut microbiome in male APPPS1-21 mice lead to reductions in amyloid β (Aβ) plaque pathology and altered phenotypes of plaque-associated microglia. Here, we show that a short, 7-d treatment of preweaned male mice with high-dose ABX is associated with reductions of Aβ amyloidosis, plaque-localized microglia morphologies, and Aβ-associated degenerative changes at 9 wk of age in male mice only. More importantly, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from transgenic (Tg) or WT male donors into ABX-treated male mice completely restored Aβ amyloidosis, plaque-localized microglia morphologies, and Aβ-associated degenerative changes. Transcriptomic studies revealed significant differences between vehicle versus ABX-treated male mice and FMT from Tg mice into ABX-treated mice largely restored the transcriptome profiles to that of the Tg donor animals. Finally, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor-mediated depletion of microglia in ABX-treated male mice failed to reduce cerebral Aβ amyloidosis. Thus, microglia play a critical role in driving gut microbiome-mediated alterations of cerebral Aβ deposition.

## Altered cervicovaginal microbiota in premenopausal ovarian cancer patients.
 02.12.2021, _A Morikawa, A Kawabata, K Shirahige, T Akiyama, A Okamoto, T Sutani_


Nearly three hundred thousand female patients are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the world annually, and this number shows an increasing trend. However, characteristic symptoms caused by ovarian cancer are so few that early diagnosis remains challenging, and an effective screening method has not yet been established. Here, we conducted a case-control study in Japan to analyze the association between cervicovaginal microbiome and ovarian cancer, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Analysis of DNA extracted from cervical smear samples revealed Lactobacillus-dominant and Lactobacillus-deficient, highly-diversified bacterial communities in premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy controls, respectively, as reported for vaginal microbiota previously. We found that cervicovaginal microbiota in ovarian cancer patients, regardless of their menopausal status, were frequently a diversified community and similar to those in healthy subjects at postmenopausal ages. The diverse microbiota was associated with the major histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, including serous ovarian cancer and ovarian clear cell cancer. The present study implies the potential of a cervicovaginal microbiome biomarker in screening ovarian cancer in premenopausal women.

Mutation occurs in the prostate cell genes, leading to abnormal prostate proliferation and ultimately cancer. Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers amongst men, and its prevalence worldwide increases relative to men's age. About 16% of the world's cancers are the result of microbes in the human body. Impaired population balance of symbiosis microbes in the human reproductive system is linked to PC development.

## The gut microbiota in retinal diseases.
 02.12.2021, _MA Bringer, PH Gabrielle, AM Bron, C Creuzot-Garcher, N Acar_


The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem that inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and consists of archaea, fungi, viruses, and bacteria, with bacteria being dominant. From birth onwards, it coevolves dynamically together with the host. The composition of the gut microbiota is under the influence of a complex interplay between both host and environmental factors. Scientific advances in the past few decades have shown that it is essential in maintaining homeostasis and tipping the balance between health and disease. In addition to its role in food digestion, the gut microbiota is implicated in regulating multiple physiological processes in the host gut mucosa and in distant organs such as the brain. Persistent imbalance between gut microbial communities, termed "dysbiosis," has been associated with several inflammatory and metabolic diseases as well as with central nervous system disorders. In this review, we present the state of the art of current knowledge on an emerging concept, the microbiota-retina axis, and the potential role of its disturbance in the development of retinopathies. We also describe several microbiota-targeting strategies that could constitute preventive and therapeutic tools for retinopathies.

## Microbe-based management for colorectal cancer.
 03.12.2021, _ZY Gao, Z Cui, YQ Yan, LJ Ning, ZH Wang, J Hong_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent, most lethal cancers in the world. Increasing evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiota is closely related to the pathogenesis and prognosis of CRC. The normal microbiota plays an essential role in maintaining gut barrier function and the immune microenvironment. Recent studies have identified carcinogenic bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) and Streptococcus gallolyticus (S. gallolyticus), as well as protective bacterial such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), as potential targets of CRC treatment. Gut microbiota modulation aims to restore gut dysbiosis, regulate the intestinal immune system and prevent from pathogen invasion, all of which are beneficial for CRC prevention and prognosis. The utility of probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation and dietary inventions to treat CRC makes them novel microbe-based management tools. In this review, we describe the mechanisms involved in bacteria-derived colorectal carcinogenesis and summarized novel bacteria-related therapies for CRC. In summary, we hope to facilitate clinical applications of intestinal bacteria for preventing and treating CRC.

## Novel Strategies for Inhibition of Bacterial Biofilm in Chronic Rhinosinusitis.
 02.12.2021, _A Shariati, S Vesal, A Khoshbayan, P Goudarzi, D Darban-Sarokhali, S Razavi, M Didehdar, Z Chegini_


An important role has been recently reported for bacterial biofilm in the pathophysiology of chronic diseases, such as Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS). CRS, affecting sinonasal mucosa, is a persistent inflammatory condition with a high prevalence around the world. Although the exact pathological mechanism of this disease has not been elicited yet, biofilm formation is known to lead to a more significant symptom burden and major objective clinical indicators. The high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has severely restricted the application of antibiotics in recent years. Furthermore, systemic antibiotic therapy, on top of its insufficient concentration to eradicate bacteria in the sinonasal biofilm, often causes toxicity, antibiotic resistance, and an effect on the natural microbiota, in patients. Thus, coming up with alternative therapeutic options instead of systemic antibiotic therapy is emphasized in the treatment of bacterial biofilm in CRS patients. The use of topical antibiotic therapy and antibiotic eluting sinus stents that induce higher antibiotic concentration, and decrease side effects could be helpful. Besides, recent research recognized that various natural products, nitric oxide, and bacteriophage therapy, in addition to the hindered biofilm formation, could degrade the established bacterial biofilm. However, despite these improvements, new antibacterial agents and CRS biofilm interactions are complicated and need extensive research. Finally, most studies were performed in vitro, and more preclinical animal models and human studies are required to confirm the collected data. The present review is specifically discussing potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of bacterial biofilm in CRS patients.

## Interactions of Muscovy duck reovirus, gut microbiota, and host innate immunity: Transcriptome and gut microbiota analysis.
 02.12.2021, _Z Zhu, L Liao, J Su, Z Liu, S Pan, Y Huang, Y Wu_


It has been shown that Muscovy duck reovirus (MDRV) infection causes severe intestinal barrier damage and intestinal mucosal immune suppression. The health and balance of gut microbes is essential for the progression of intestinal infectious diseases. To investigate the interaction of MDRV, intestinal bacteria with host intestinal innate immunity, an MDRV contact-infection model was established in this study. High-throughput sequencing technology was used to sequence 16S rDNA and transcripts in ileal samples from experimental Muscovy ducklings. Our results suggest that intestinal opportunistic pathogens such as Streptococcus and Corynebacterium proliferated massively in MDRV-infected Muscovy ducklings. The body initiates antiviral and antibacterial immunity and actively fights the infection of gut microbes. The synthesis of peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and flagellin by intestinal bacteria activates the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway resulting in increased secretion of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-8. The RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway is an important signaling pathway for the interaction between MDRV and the host. At the same time, we also observed that multiple genes in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway were significantly different. These genes are important targets for studying the immunosuppression caused by MDRV. In conclusion, we analyzed the interaction of MDRV, intestinal flora and host immune system during MDRV infection, which provides a basis for the further study on the mechanism of intestinal immunosuppression caused by MDRV.

## Antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes and microbial community in grouper mariculture.
 02.12.2021, _LX He, LY He, FZ Gao, DL Wu, P Ye, YX Cheng, ZY Chen, LX Hu, YS Liu, J Chen, GG Ying_


Increasing use of feed and medicine in mariculture could cause negative environmental impacts such as habitat modification, microbial disease development and antibiotic resistance. Here we investigated contamination of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and composition of microbial community in grouper mariculture systems in Hainan province, China. Results showed detection of various antibiotic residues with the dominance of fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines in the six grouper cultivation systems. The concentrations of the detected antibiotics in the grouper mariculture water were significantly higher than those in the original seawater. Some of the detected antibiotics such as enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxytetracycline and erythromycin in the mariculture water and/or sediment would pose high resistance selection risks. Sulfonamides resistance genes sul1 and sul2 were found to be predominant in water and sediment, while tetracycline resistance genes were prevalent in fish gill and gut. The dominant bacterial phyla in water and sediments were Bacteroides, Actinomycetes, and Proteobacteria, while the dominant ones in fish gill and gut were the Proteobacteria. Genera of Vibrio and Mycobacterium in the core microbiota were important zoonotic pathogens, and there was a significant positive correlation between Vibrio and ARGs. Phyla of Proteobacteria, Actinomyces, and Cyanobacteria were positively correlated to ARGs, indicating that these microorganisms are potential hosts of ARGs. The putative functions of microbiome related to antibiotic resistance and human diseases were significantly higher in fish than in the mariculture environment. This study suggests that mariculture system is a reservoir of ARGs, and the use of antibiotics in mariculture could induce the increase of antibiotic resistance and the prevalence of opportunistic pathogens.

This study evaluated the effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on oxidative stress and energy metabolism parameters in the visceral fat of a high-fat-diet induced obesity model. Energy intake, body mass, and visceral fat mass were also evaluated. Male Swiss mice received either a control diet (control group) or a high-fat diet (obese group) for 6 weeks. After this period, the groups were divided into control + saline, control + omega-3, obese + saline, and obese + omega-3, and to these groups 400 mg·(kg body mass)-1·day-1 of fish oil (or saline) was administered orally, for 4 weeks. Energy intake and body mass were monitored throughout the experiment. In the 10th week, the animals were euthanized and the visceral fat (mesenteric) was removed. Treatment with omega-3 PUFAs did not affect energy intake or body mass, but it did reduced visceral fat mass. In visceral fat, omega-3 PUFAs reduced oxidative damage and alleviated changes to the antioxidant defense system and the Krebs cycle. The mitochondrial respiratory chain was neither altered by obesity nor by omega-3 PUFAs. In conclusion, omega-3 PUFAs have beneficial effects on the visceral fat of obese mice because they mitigate changes caused by the consumption of a high-fat diet.

## The highly diverse Antarctic Peninsula soil microbiota as a source of novel resistance genes.

The rise of multiresistant bacterial pathogens is currently one of the most critical threats to global health, encouraging a better understanding of the evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance. In this regard, the role of the environment as a source of resistance mechanisms remains poorly understood. Moreover, we still know a minimal part of the microbial diversity and resistome present in remote and extreme environments, hosting microbes that evolved to resist harsh conditions and thus a potentially rich source of novel resistance genes. This work demonstrated that the Antarctic Peninsula soils host a remarkable microbial diversity and a widespread presence of autochthonous antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes. We observed resistance to a wide array of antibiotics among isolates, including Pseudomonas resisting ten or more different compounds, with an overall increased resistance in bacteria from non-intervened areas. In addition, genome analysis of selected isolates showed several genes encoding efflux pumps, as well as a lack of known resistance genes for some of the resisted antibiotics, including colistin, suggesting novel uncharacterized mechanisms. By combining metagenomic approaches based on analyzing raw reads, assembled contigs, and metagenome-assembled genomes, we found hundreds of widely distributed genes potentially conferring resistance to different antibiotics (including an outstanding variety of inactivation enzymes), metals, and biocides, hosted mainly by Polaromonas, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Variovorax, and Burkholderia. Furthermore, a proportion of these genes were found inside predicted plasmids and other mobile elements, including a putative OXA-like carbapenemase from Polaromonas harboring conserved key residues and predicted structural features. All this evidence indicates that the Antarctic Peninsula soil microbiota has a broad natural resistome, part of which could be transferred horizontally to pathogenic bacteria, acting as a potential source of novel resistance genes.

## In vitro interaction network of a synthetic gut bacterial community.
 03.12.2021, _AS Weiss, AG Burrichter, AC Durai Raj, A von Strempel, C Meng, K Kleigrewe, PC Münch, L Rössler, C Huber, W Eisenreich, LM Jochum, S Göing, K Jung, C Lincetto, J Hübner, G Marinos, J Zimmermann, C Kaleta, A Sanchez, B Stecher_


A key challenge in microbiome research is to predict the functionality of microbial communities based on community membership and (meta)-genomic data. As central microbiota functions are determined by bacterial community networks, it is important to gain insight into the principles that govern bacteria-bacteria interactions. Here, we focused on the growth and metabolic interactions of the Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota (OMM12) synthetic bacterial community, which is increasingly used as a model system in gut microbiome research. Using a bottom-up approach, we uncovered the directionality of strain-strain interactions in mono- and pairwise co-culture experiments as well as in community batch culture. Metabolic network reconstruction in combination with metabolomics analysis of bacterial culture supernatants provided insights into the metabolic potential and activity of the individual community members. Thereby, we could show that the OMM12 interaction network is shaped by both exploitative and interference competition in vitro in nutrient-rich culture media and demonstrate how community structure can be shifted by changing the nutritional environment. In particular, Enterococcus faecalis KB1 was identified as an important driver of community composition by affecting the abundance of several other consortium members in vitro. As a result, this study gives fundamental insight into key drivers and mechanistic basis of the OMM12 interaction network in vitro, which serves as a knowledge base for future mechanistic in vivo studies.

## An ancient antimicrobial protein co-opted by a fungal plant pathogen for in planta mycobiome manipulation.
 02.12.2021, _NC Snelders, GC Petti, GCM van den Berg, MF Seidl, BPHJ Thomma_


Microbes typically secrete a plethora of molecules to promote niche colonization. Soil-dwelling microbes are well-known producers of antimicrobials that are exploited to outcompete microbial coinhabitants. Also, plant pathogenic microbes secrete a diversity of molecules into their environment for niche establishment. Upon plant colonization, microbial pathogens secrete so-called effector proteins that promote disease development. While such effectors are typically considered to exclusively act through direct host manipulation, we recently reported that the soil-borne, fungal, xylem-colonizing vascular wilt pathogen Verticillium dahliae exploits effector proteins with antibacterial properties to promote host colonization through the manipulation of beneficial host microbiota. Since fungal evolution preceded land plant evolution, we now speculate that a subset of the pathogen effectors involved in host microbiota manipulation evolved from ancient antimicrobial proteins of terrestrial fungal ancestors that served in microbial competition prior to the evolution of plant pathogenicity. Here, we show that V. dahliae has co-opted an ancient antimicrobial protein as effector, named VdAMP3, for mycobiome manipulation in planta. We show that VdAMP3 is specifically expressed to ward off fungal niche competitors during resting structure formation in senescing mesophyll tissues. Our findings indicate that effector-mediated microbiome manipulation by plant pathogenic microbes extends beyond bacteria and also concerns eukaryotic members of the plant microbiome. Finally, we demonstrate that fungal pathogens can exploit plant microbiome-manipulating effectors in a life stage-specific manner and that a subset of these effectors has evolved from ancient antimicrobial proteins of fungal ancestors that likely originally functioned in manipulation of terrestrial biota.

Bacteria from different crops and plant varieties have been shown to possess enormous growth promotional attributes. The study aimed to investigate the role of the endophytic microbiome of seeds of corn in improving the growth of seedlings of two different varieties of maize crops (K-25 and baby corn). Furthermore, the study also assessed the role of these bacteria in the protection of seedlings from fungal pathogens. Total twenty-three endophytic bacterial strains were isolated from maize seeds and identified using 16S rDNA sequencing. Most of the isolates had the ability to synthesize auxin (70 %) and solubilize phosphate (74 %), while all the isolates showed nitrogen fixation ability. Some isolates also showed antagonistic activity against phytopathogenic fungi including Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium sp. suggesting their biocontrol potential. The presence of different lipopeptide genes including bacillomycin D, fengycin, iturin A and surfactin was confirmed in some of the isolates. We observed that treating seeds with an antibiotic compromised the seedlings' growth; however, re-inoculation with endophytic isolates (ZM1/Lysinibacillus sp. and ZM2/Paenibacillus dendritiformis) restored the growth of the seedlings in terms of improved root and shoot development in comparison to non-inoculated controls. The colonization of inoculated bacteria on the root surface was visualized using fluorescent microscopy. Seedling protection assay showed that treated seeds (with ZMW8/ Bacillus velezensis) were protected from fungal infestation (Fusarium verticillioides) even after 12 days of inoculation in comparison to the uninoculated control. The study concludes that indigenous seed-associated bacteria of maize play a major role during seed germination, seedling formation and protect them from phytopathogens.
