We aimed to investigate whether the gut microbiota and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with skeletal muscle mass and strength in healthy Chinese children aged 6-9 years. In this study, 412 children were enrolled. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the gut microbiota compositions. Fecal SCFAs were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. Dual X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure the total body lean soft tissue mass (TSM), total body fat mass (TBF), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), and appendicular fat mass (AFM). TSM/height2 (TSMI), ASM/height2 (ASMI), TSM/weight (TSMR), ASM/weight (ASMR), and the ratio of TSM/TBF and ASM/AFM were calculated. Handgrip strength (HGS) was measured using the Jamar® Plus+ Hand Dynamometer. A multiple regression analysis after adjustment for covariates and multiple test correction showed some operational taxonomic units in partial least squares models identified by Multivariate methods with Unbiased Variable selection analysis such as genera of Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-004 were positively correlated with at least one measure of TSM, TSMI, ASM, ASMI, and ASMI Z-score (β: 0.103-0.143, pFDR : .008-.032) but negatively correlated with at least one measure of TSMR, TSM/TBF, ASMR, ASM/AFM, and ASMR Z-score (β: -0.185 to 0.124, pFDR = .008-.045). Children with higher fecal butyric acid, acetic acid, and total SCFA levels exhibited higher TSM, ASM, TSMI, ASMI, and ASMI Z-score and lower TSM/TBF, ASM/AFM, TSMR, ASMR, and ASMR Z-score. However, after additional adjustment for TBF or body mass index, only the associations for Faecalitalea and Pyramidobacter still existed. Mediation analysis suggested that total body fat significantly mediated 66.3%-95.3% of the estimated association of microbiota and SCFAs with TSM, ASM, and ASMI Z-score. Our results suggest that the associations of gut microbiota and SCFAs with skeletal muscle quality in children may largely depend upon on total body fat content.

The intestinal microbiome is the genetic material from microorganisms residing in the intestinal tract. Very low-birth-weight infants (VLBW; birth weight ≤1500 g) are a physiologically compromised population undergoing a unique period of initial intestinal microbiome establishment. Evidence supports a connection between the intestinal microbiome and gastrointestinal illness that disproportionately affects VLBW infants. Necrotizing enterocolitis, an inflammatory and often necrotic condition of the intestine, and late-onset sepsis, a bloodstream infection occurring after 3 days of life, are thought to be associated with delayed or abnormal intestinal microbiome development. Here, we review the determinants, or factors, that influence the VLBW infant's intestinal microbiome and discuss clinical implications. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and CINAHL were systematically searched for publications addressing factors with the potential to affect the intestinal microbiome of VLBW infants. Results indicate that infant's age and weight, mode of delivery, antibiotic exposure, medication use, feeding regime, environment, and perinatal-/infant-associated factors may be important determinants of the microbiome in this vulnerable population. Clinicians have opportunities to support positive development of the VLBW infant's intestinal microbiome through antibiotic stewardship, support of human milk feeding, and hygienic care practices.

## Genomic characterization of the dominating Beta variant carrying vaccinated (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and non-vaccinated COVID-19 patient samples in Bangladesh: A metagenomics and whole genome approach.

Bangladesh experiences a second wave of COVID-19 since March 2021, despite the nationwide vaccination drive with ChAdOx1 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine from early February 2021. Here, we characterized 19 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples from COVID-19 suspect patients using genomic and metagenomic approach. Screening for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and metagenomic sequencing revealed 17 samples of COVID-19 positive (vaccinated=10, non-vaccinated=7) and 2 samples of COVID-19 negative. We did not find any significant correlation between associated factors including vaccination status, age or sex of the patients, diversity or abundance of the co-infected organisms/pathogens, and the abundance of SARS-CoV-2. Though the first wave of the pandemic was dominated by clade 20B, Beta,V2 (South African variant) dominated the second wave (January 2021 to May 2021), while the third wave (May 2021 to September 2021) was responsible for Delta variants of the epidemic in Bangladesh including both vaccinated and unvaccinated infections. Noteworthy, the RBD region of S protein of all the isolates harbored similar substitutions including K417N, E484K and N501Y that signify the Beta, while D614G, D215G, D80A, A67V, L18F and A701V substitutions were commonly found in the non-RBD region of Spike proteins. ORF7b and ORF3a genes underwent a positive selection (dN/dS ratio 1.77 and 1.24, respectively), while the overall S protein of the Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 isolates underwent negative selection pressure (dN/dS=0.621). Furthermore, we found different bacterial co-infection like Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria meningitidis, Elizabethkingia anophelis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoni and Pseudomonas plecoglossicida, expressing a number of antibiotic resistance genes such as tetA and tetM. Overall, this approach provides valuable insights on the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and microbiome composition from both vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients in Bangladesh.

## Concepts and Consequences of a Core Gut Microbiota for Animal Growth and Development.
 23.12.2021, _D Perlman, M Martínez-Álvaro, S Moraïs, I Altshuler, LH Hagen, E Jami, R Roehe, PB Pope, I Mizrahi_


Animal microbiomes are occasionally considered as an extension of host anatomy, physiology, and even their genomic architecture. Their compositions encompass variable and constant portions when examined across multiple hosts. The latter, termed the core microbiome, is viewed as more accommodated to its host environment and suggested to benefit host fitness. Nevertheless, discrepancies in its definitions, characteristics, and importance to its hosts exist across studies. We survey studies that characterize the core microbiome, detail its current definitions and available methods to identify it, and emphasize the crucial need to upgrade and standardize the methodologies among studies. We highlight ruminants as a case study and discuss the link between the core microbiome and host physiology and genetics, as well as potential factors that shape it. We conclude with main directives of action to better understand the host-core microbiome axis and acquire the necessary insights into its controlled modulation. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Animal Biosciences, Volume 10 is February 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

## Assessment of Changes in the Oral Microbiome That Occur in Dogs with Periodontal Disease.
 25.12.2021, _R Santibáñez, C Rodríguez-Salas, C Flores-Yáñez, D Garrido, P Thomson_


The oral microbiome in dogs is a complex community. Under some circumstances, it contributes to periodontal disease, a prevalent inflammatory disease characterized by a complex interaction between oral microbes and the immune system. Porphyromonas and Tannerella spp. are usually dominant in this disease. How the oral microbiome community is altered in periodontal disease, especially sub-dominant microbial populations is unclear. Moreover, how microbiome functions are altered in this disease has not been studied. In this study, we compared the composition and the predicted functions of the microbiome of the cavity of healthy dogs to those with from periodontal disease. The microbiome of both groups clustered separately, indicating important differences. Periodontal disease resulted in a significant increase in Bacteroidetes and reductions in Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Porphyromonas abundance increased 2.7 times in periodontal disease, accompanied by increases in Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. It was predicted that aerobic respiratory processes are decreased in periodontal disease. Enrichment in fermentative processes and anaerobic glycolysis were suggestive of an anaerobic environment, also characterized by higher lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. This study contributes to a better understanding of how periodontal disease modifies the oral microbiome and makes a prediction of the metabolic pathways that contribute to the inflammatory process observed in periodontal disease.

## Evaluation of Microbiome Alterations Following Consumption of BIOHM, a Novel Probiotic.
 24.12.2021, _MA Ghannoum, TS McCormick, M Retuerto, G Bebek, S Cousineau, L Hartman, C Barth, K Schrom_


Gastrointestinal microbiome dysbiosis may result in harmful effects on the host, including those caused by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The novel probiotic BIOHM, consisting of Bifidobacterium breve, Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, and amylase, was developed to rebalance the bacterial-fungal gut microbiome, with the goal of reducing inflammation and maintaining a healthy gut population. To test the effect of BIOHM on human subjects, we enrolled a cohort of 49 volunteers in collaboration with the Fermentation Festival group (Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The profiles of gut bacterial and fungal communities were assessed via stool samples collected at baseline and following 4 weeks of once-a-day BIOHM consumption. Mycobiome analysis following probiotic consumption revealed an increase in Ascomycota levels in enrolled individuals and a reduction in Zygomycota levels (p value &lt; 0.01). No statistically significant difference in Basidiomycota was detected between pre- and post-BIOHM samples and control abundance profiles (p &gt; 0.05). BIOHM consumption led to a significant reduction in the abundance of Candida genus in tested subjects (p value &lt; 0.013), while the abundance of C. albicans also trended lower than before BIOHM use, albeit not reaching statistical significance. A reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level was observed following BIOHM use, which approached levels reported for control individuals reported in the Human Microbiome Project data. The preliminary results from this clinical study suggest that BIOHM is capable of significantly rebalancing the bacteriome and mycobiome in the gut of healthy individuals, suggesting that further trials examining the utility of the BIOHM probiotic in individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms, where dysbiosis is considered a source driving pathogenesis, are warranted.

## Site and land-use associations of soil bacteria and fungi define core and indicative taxa.
 23.12.2021, _G Florian, H Martin, M Johanna, H Anna-Sofia, E Jürg, G Andreas, M Reto G, F Beat, W Franco_


Soil microbial diversity has major influences on ecosystem functions and services. However, due to its complexity and uneven distribution of abundant and rare taxa, quantification of soil microbial diversity remains challenging and thereby impeding its integration into long-term monitoring programs. Using metabarcoding, we analyzed soil bacterial and fungal communities at thirty long-term soil monitoring sites from the three land-use types arable land, permanent grassland, and forest with a yearly sampling between snowmelt and first fertilization over five years. Unlike soil microbial biomass and alpha-diversity, microbial community compositions and structures were site- and land-use-specific with CAP reclassification success rates of 100%. The temporally stable site core communities included 38.5% of bacterial and 33.1% of fungal OTUs covering 95.9% and 93.2% of relative abundances. We characterized bacterial and fungal core communities and their land-use associations at the family-level. In general, fungal families revealed stronger land-use associations as compared to bacteria. This is likely due to a stronger vegetation effect on fungal core taxa, while bacterial core taxa were stronger related to soil properties. The assessment of core communities can be used to form cultivation-independent reference lists of microbial taxa, which may facilitate the development of microbial indicators for soil quality and the use of soil microbiota for long-term soil biomonitoring.
