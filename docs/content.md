Bacteriocins are peptide-derived molecules produced by bacteria, whose recently-discovered functions include virulence factors and signaling molecules as well as their better known roles as antibiotics. To date, close to five hundred bacteriocins have been identified and classified. Recent discoveries have shown that bacteriocins are highly diverse and widely distributed among bacterial species. Given the heterogeneity of bacteriocin compounds, many tools struggle with identifying novel bacteriocins due to their vast sequence and structural diversity. Many bacteriocins undergo post-translational processing or modifications necessary for the biosynthesis of the final mature form. Enzymatic modification of bacteriocins as well as their export is achieved by proteins whose genes are often located in a discrete gene cluster proximal to the bacteriocin precursor gene, referred to as context genes in this study. Although bacteriocins themselves are structurally diverse, context genes have been shown to be largely conserved across unrelated species.

## The Local Tumor Microbiome Is Associated with Survival in Late-Stage Colorectal Cancer Patients.
 12.04.2023, _JW Debelius, L Engstrand, A Matussek, N Brusselaers, JT Morton, M Stenmarker, RS Olsen_


The gut microbiome is associated with survival in colorectal cancer. Single organisms have been identified as markers of poor prognosis. However, in situ imaging of tumors demonstrate a polymicrobial tumor-associated community. To understand the role of these polymicrobial communities in survival, we conducted a nested case-control study in late-stage cancer patients undergoing resection for primary adenocarcinoma. The microbiome of paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples was profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing. We found a consistent difference in the microbiome between paired tumor and adjacent tissue, despite strong individual microbial identities. Furthermore, a larger difference between normal and tumor tissue was associated with prognosis: patients with shorter survival had a larger difference between normal and tumor tissue. Within the tumor tissue, we identified a 39-member community statistic associated with survival; for every log2-fold increase in this value, an individual's odds of survival increased by 20% (odds ratio survival 1.20; 95% confidence interval = 1.04 to 1.33). Our results suggest that a polymicrobial tumor-specific microbiome is associated with survival in late-stage colorectal cancer patients. IMPORTANCE Microbiome studies in colorectal cancer (CRC) have primarily focused on the role of single organisms in cancer progression. Recent work has identified specific organisms throughout the intestinal tract, which may affect survival; however, the results are inconsistent. We found differences between the tumor microbiome and the microbiome of the rest of the intestine in patients, and the magnitude of this difference was associated with survival, or, the more like a healthy gut a tumor looked, the better a patient's prognosis. Our results suggest that future microbiome-based interventions to affect survival in CRC will need to target the tumor community.

## The microbial dark matter and "wanted list" in worldwide wastewater treatment plants.
 13.04.2023, _Y Zhang, Y Wang, M Tang, J Zhou, T Zhang_

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the largest biotechnology applications in the world and are of critical importance to modern urban societies. An accurate evaluation of the microbial dark matter (MDM, microorganisms whose genomes remain uncharacterized) proportions in WWTPs is of great value, while there is no such research yet. This study conducted a global meta-analysis of MDM in WWTPs with 317,542 prokaryotic genomes from the Genome Taxonomy Database and proposed a "wanted list" for priority targets in further investigations of activated sludge.

## Microbiome, resistome and mobilome of chlorine-free drinking water treatment systems.
 14.04.2023, _D Calderón-Franco, F Corbera-Rubio, M Cuesta-Sanz, B Pieterse, D de Ridder, MCM van Loosdrecht, D van Halem, M Laureni, DG Weissbrodt_


Drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) are designed to remove physical, chemical, and biological contaminants. However, until recently, the role of DWTPs in minimizing the cycling of antibiotic resistance determinants has got limited attention. In particular, the risk of selecting antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) is largely overlooked in chlorine-free DWTPs where biological processes are applied. Here, we combined high-throughput quantitative PCR and metagenomics to analyze the abundance and dynamics of microbial communities, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) across the treatment trains of two chlorine-free DWTPs involving dune-based and reservoir-based systems. The microbial diversity of the water increased after all biological unit operations, namely rapid and slow sand filtration (SSF), and granular activated carbon filtration. Both DWTPs reduced the concentration of ARGs and MGEs in the water by circa 2.5 log gene copies mL-1, despite their relative increase in the disinfection sub-units (SSF in dune-based and UV treatment in reservoir-based DWTPs). The total microbial concentration was also reduced (2.5 log units), and none of the DWTPs enriched for bacteria containing genes linked to antibiotic resistance. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of chlorine-free DWTPs in supplying safe drinking water while reducing the concentration of antibiotic resistance determinants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that monitors the presence and dynamics of antibiotic resistance determinants in chlorine-free DWTPs.

## Developing next generation 3D-printing for cervical cancer hybrid brachytherapy: a guided interstitial technique enabling improved flexibility, dosimetry, and efficiency.
 14.04.2023, _M Marar, T Niedermayr, E Kidd_


We developed a 3D-printed tandem anchored radially guiding interstitial template (TARGIT) to increase the simplicity of intracavitary/interstitial (IC/IS) technique for tandem-and-ovoid (T&amp;O) procedures in cervical cancer brachytherapy. This study compared dosimetry and procedure logistics between T&amp;O implants using the original TARGIT versus the next-generation TARGIT-Flexible-eXtended (TARGIT-FX) 3D-printed template designed for practice-changing ease-of-use with further simplified needle insertion and increased flexibility in needle placement.

## Antibiotic treatment using amoxicillin-clavulanic acid impairs gut mycobiota development through modification of the bacterial ecosystem.

_Humans, Mice, Animals, Amoxicillin-Potassium Clavulanate Combination, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Gastrointestinal Tract, Microbiota, Fungi, Bacteria_
Effects of antibiotics on gut bacteria have been widely studied, but very little is known about the consequences of such treatments on the fungal microbiota (mycobiota). It is commonly believed that fungal load increases in the gastrointestinal tract following antibiotic treatment, but better characterization is clearly needed of how antibiotics directly or indirectly affect the mycobiota and thus the entire microbiota.
