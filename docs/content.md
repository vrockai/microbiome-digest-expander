The microbiome research field is rapidly evolving, but the required biobanking infrastructure is currently fragmented and not prepared for the biobanking of microbiomes. The rapid advancement of technologies requires an urgent assessment of how biobanks can underpin research by preserving microbiome samples and their functional potential.

## STROBE-metagenomics: a STROBE extension statement to guide the reporting of metagenomics studies.
 12.08.2020, _T Bharucha, C Oeser, F Balloux, JR Brown, EC Carbo, A Charlett, CY Chiu, ECJ Claas, MC de Goffau, JJC de Vries, M Eloit, S Hopkins, JF Huggett, D MacCannell, S Morfopoulou, A Nath, DM O'Sullivan, LB Reoma, LP Shaw, I Sidorov, PJ Simner, L Van Tan, EC Thomson, L van Dorp, MR Wilson, J Breuer, N Field_


The term metagenomics refers to the use of sequencing methods to simultaneously identify genomic material from all organisms present in a sample, with the advantage of greater taxonomic resolution than culture or other methods. Applications include pathogen detection and discovery, species characterisation, antimicrobial resistance detection, virulence profiling, and study of the microbiome and microecological factors affecting health. However, metagenomics involves complex and multistep processes and there are important technical and methodological challenges that require careful consideration to support valid inference. We co-ordinated a multidisciplinary, international expert group to establish reporting guidelines that address specimen processing, nucleic acid extraction, sequencing platforms, bioinformatics considerations, quality assurance, limits of detection, power and sample size, confirmatory testing, causality criteria, cost, and ethical issues. The guidance recognises that metagenomics research requires pragmatism and caution in interpretation, and that this field is rapidly evolving.

## Schizasterid Heart Urchins Host Microorganisms in a Digestive Symbiosis of Mesozoic Origin.
 14.08.2020, _A Ziegler, AM Gilligan, JG Dillon, B Pernet_


Because of their lifestyles, abundance, and feeding habits, infaunal marine deposit feeders have a significant impact on the ocean floor. As these animals also ingest microorganisms associated with their sediment and seawater diet, their digestive tract usually contains a diverse array of bacteria. However, while most of these microorganisms are transients, some may become part of a resident gut microbiome, in particular when sheltered from the main flow of digesta in specialized gut compartments. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of the structure and contents of the intestinal caecum (IC), a hindgut diverticulum found exclusively in schizasterid heart urchins (Echinoidea: Spatangoida: Schizasteridae). Based on specimens of Brisaster townsendi, in addition to various other schizasterid taxa, our structural characterization of the IC shows that the organ is a highly specialized gut compartment with unique structural properties. Next generation sequencing shows that the IC contains a microbial population composed predominantly of Bacteroidales, Desulfobacterales, and Spirochaetales. The microbiome of this gut compartment is significantly different in composition and lower in diversity than the microbial population in the sediment-filled main digestive tract. Inferences on the function and evolution of the IC and its microbiome suggest that this symbiosis plays a distinct role in host nutrition and that it evolved at least 66 million years ago during the final phase of the Mesozoic.

## Microbiota-host interactions shape ageing dynamics.
 10.08.2020, _M Popkes, DR Valenzano_


Occupying the interface between host and environment, host-associated microbes play fundamental roles in nutrient absorption, essential metabolite synthesis, development of the immune system, defence against pathogens and pathogenesis. Microbiota composition and function is rather stable during adulthood, while it dramatically changes during early development, frailty and disease. Ageing is associated with progressive decrease of homeostasis, often resulting in disruption of the physiological balance between host and commensal microbes, ultimately leading to dysbiosis and host demise. Generally, high microbial diversity is associated with health and a youthful state, while low individual microbial diversity and larger inter-individual microbial diversity is associated with ageing and disease states. Different species are equipped with species-specific commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microbial communities. How and whether the specific host-microbiota consortia co-evolved with host physiology to ensure homeostasis and promote individual fitness remains an open question. In this essay, we propose that the evolution of vertebrate-specific immune adaptations may have enabled the establishment of highly diverse, species-specific commensal microbial communities. We discuss how the maintenance of intact immune surveillance mechanisms, which allow discrimination between commensal and pathogenic bacteria, fail during ageing and lead to the onset of known ageing-related diseases. We discuss how host-microbiota interactions are key to maintaining homeostasis despite external perturbations, but also how they affect a range of host-specific ageing-related phenotypes. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of the microbiome in host evolution'.

## Pathogen resistance may be the principal evolutionary advantage provided by the microbiome.
 10.08.2020, _MR McLaren, BJ Callahan_


To survive, plants and animals must continually defend against pathogenic microbes that would invade and disrupt their tissues. Yet they do not attempt to extirpate all microbes. Instead, they tolerate and even encourage the growth of commensal microbes, which compete with pathogens for resources and via direct inhibition. We argue that hosts have evolved to cooperate with commensals in order to enhance the pathogen resistance this competition provides. We briefly describe competition between commensals and pathogens within the host, consider how natural selection might favour hosts that tilt this competition in favour of commensals, and describe examples of extant host traits that may serve this purpose. Finally, we consider ways that this cooperative immunity may have facilitated the adaptive evolution of non-pathogen-related host traits. On the basis of these observations, we argue that pathogen resistance vies with other commensal-provided benefits for being the principal evolutionary advantage provided by the microbiome to host lineages across the tree of life. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of the microbiome in host evolution'.

## Inclusion of Oxford Nanopore long reads improves all microbial and viral metagenome-assembled genomes from a complex aquifer system.
 07.08.2020, _WA Overholt, M Hölzer, P Geesink, C Diezel, M Marz, K Küsel_


Assembling microbial and viral genomes from metagenomes is a powerful and appealing method to understand structure-function relationships in complex environments. To compare the recovery of genomes from microorganisms and their viruses from groundwater, we generated shotgun metagenomes with Illumina sequencing accompanied by long reads derived from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platform. Assembly and metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) metrics for both microbes and viruses were determined from an Illumina-only assembly, ONT-only assembly, and a hybrid assembly approach. The hybrid approach recovered 2x more mid to high-quality MAGs compared to the Illumina-only approach and 4x more than the ONT-only approach. A similar number of viral genomes were reconstructed using the hybrid and ONT methods, and both recovered nearly four-fold more viral genomes than the Illumina-only approach. While yielding fewer MAGs, the ONT-only approach generated MAGs with a high probability of containing rRNA genes, 3x higher than either of the other methods. Of the shared MAGs recovered from each method, the ONT-only approach generated the longest and least fragmented MAGs, while the hybrid approach yielded the most complete. This work provides quantitative data to inform a cost-benefit analysis of the decision to supplement shotgun metagenomic projects with long reads towards the goal of recovering genomes from environmentally abundant groups.

## Meta-analysis of 16S rRNA Microbial Data Identified Distinctive and Predictive Microbiota Dysbiosis in Colorectal Carcinoma Adjacent Tissue.
 28.07.2020, _Z Mo, P Huang, C Yang, S Xiao, G Zhang, F Ling, L Li_


As research focusing on the colorectal cancer fecal microbiome using shotgun sequencing continues, increasing evidence has supported correlations between colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and fecal microbiome dysbiosis. However, large-scale on-site and off-site (surrounding adjacent) tissue microbiome characterization of CRC was underrepresented. Here, considering each taxon as a feature, we demonstrate a machine learning-based method to investigate tissue microbial differences among CRC, colorectal adenoma (CRA), and healthy control groups using 16S rRNA data sets retrieved from 15 studies. A total of 2,099 samples were included and analyzed in case-control comparisons. Multiple methods, including differential abundance analysis, random forest classification, cooccurrence network analysis, and Dirichlet multinomial mixture analysis, were conducted to investigate the microbial signatures. We showed that the dysbiosis of the off-site tissue of colonic cancer was distinctive and predictive. The AUCs (areas under the curve) were 80.7%, 96.0%, and 95.8% for CRC versus healthy control random forest models using stool, tissue, and adjacent tissue samples and 69.9%, 91.5%, and 89.5% for the corresponding CRA models, respectively. We also found that the microbiota ecologies of the surrounding adjacent tissues of CRC and CRA were similar to their on-site counterparts according to network analysis. Furthermore, based on the enterotyping of tissue samples, the cohort-specific microbial signature might be the crux in addressing classification generalization problems. Despite cohort heterogeneity, the dysbiosis of lesion-adjacent tissues might provide us with further perspectives in demonstrating the role of the microbiota in colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.IMPORTANCE Turbulent fecal and tissue microbiome dysbiosis of colorectal carcinoma and adenoma has been identified, and some taxa have been proven to be carcinogenic. However, the microbiomes of surrounding adjacent tissues of colonic cancerous tissues were seldom investigated uniformly on a large scale. Here, we characterize the microbiome signatures and dysbiosis of various colonic cancer sample groups. We found a high correlation between colorectal carcinoma adjacent tissue microbiomes and their on-site counterparts. We also discovered that the microbiome dysbiosis in adjacent tissues could discriminate colorectal carcinomas from healthy controls effectively. These results extend our knowledge on the microbial profile of colorectal cancer tissues and highlight microbiota dysbiosis in the surrounding tissues. They also suggest that microbial feature variations of cancerous lesion-adjacent tissues might help to reveal the microbial etiology of colonic cancer and could ultimately be applied for diagnostic and screening purposes.

## Annual Research Review: Critical windows - the microbiota-gut-brain axis in neurocognitive development.
 19.02.2020, _CSM Cowan, TG Dinan, JF Cryan_


The gut microbiota is a vast, complex, and fascinating ecosystem of microorganisms that resides in the human gastrointestinal tract. As an integral part of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, it is now being recognized that the microbiota is a modulator of brain and behavior, across species. Intriguingly, periods of change in the microbiota coincide with the development of other body systems and particularly the brain. We hypothesize that these times of parallel development are biologically relevant, corresponding to 'sensitive periods' or 'critical windows' in the development of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Specifically, signals from the microbiota during these periods are hypothesized to be crucial for establishing appropriate communication along the axis throughout the life span. In other words, the microbiota is hypothesized to act like an expected input to calibrate the development of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The absence or disruption of the microbiota during specific developmental windows would therefore be expected to have a disproportionate effect on specific functions or potentially for regulation of the system as a whole. Evidence for microbial modulation of neurocognitive development and neurodevelopmental risk is discussed in light of this hypothesis, finishing with a focus on the challenges that lay ahead for the future study of the microbiota-gut-brain axis during development.
