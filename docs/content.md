Phages are highly abundant in the human gut, yet most of them remain uncultured. Here, we present a gut phage isolate collection (GPIC) containing 209 phages for 42 commensal human gut bacterial species. Genome analysis of the phages identified 34 undescribed genera. We discovered 22 phages from the Salasmaviridae family that have small genomes (∼10-20 kbp) and infect Gram-positive bacteria. Two phages from a candidate family, Paboviridae, with high prevalence in the human gut were also identified. Infection assays showed that Bacteroides and Parabacteroides phages are specific to a bacterial species, and strains of the same species also exhibit substantial variations in phage susceptibility. A cocktail of 8 phages with a broad host range for Bacteroides fragilis strains effectively reduced their abundance in complex host-derived communities in vitro. Our study expands the diversity of cultured human gut bacterial phages and provides a valuable resource for human microbiome engineering.

## Assembling symbiotic bacterial species into live therapeutic consortia that reconstitute microbiome functions.

_Metabolome, Proteomics, Microbiota, Feces, Metabolomics, Bacteria_
Increasing experimental evidence suggests that administering live commensal bacterial species can optimize microbiome composition and lead to reduced disease severity and enhanced health. Our understanding of the intestinal microbiome and its functions has increased over the past two decades largely due to deep sequence analyses of fecal nucleic acids, metabolomic and proteomic assays to measure nutrient use and metabolite production, and extensive studies on the metabolism and ecological interactions of a wide range of commensal bacterial species inhabiting the intestine. Herein, we review new and important findings that have emerged from this work and provide thoughts and considerations on approaches to re-establish and optimize microbiome functions by assembling and administering commensal bacterial consortia.

## One population, multiple lifestyles: Commensalism and pathogenesis in the human mycobiome.

_Humans, Mycobiome, Symbiosis, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Candida albicans, Candidiasis, Invasive_
Candida auris and Candida albicans can result in invasive fungal diseases. And yet, these species can stably and asymptomatically colonize human skin and gastrointestinal tracts. To consider these disparate microbial lifestyles, we first review factors shown to influence the underlying microbiome. Structured by the damage response framework, we then consider the molecular mechanisms deployed by C. albicans to switch between commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. Next, we explore this framework with C. auris to highlight how host physiology, immunity, and/or antibiotic receipt are associated with progression from colonization to infection. While treatment with antibiotics increases the risk that an individual will succumb to invasive candidiasis, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we describe several hypotheses that may explain this phenomenon. We conclude by highlighting future directions integrating genomics with immunology to advance our understanding of invasive candidiasis and human fungal disease.

## Cross-feeding in the gut microbiome: Ecology and mechanisms.
 17.04.2023, _EJ Culp, AL Goodman_


_Animals, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Microbiota, Symbiosis, Biological Evolution, Host Microbial Interactions, Mammals_
Microbial communities are shaped by positive and negative interactions ranging from competition to mutualism. In the context of the mammalian gut and its microbial inhabitants, the integrated output of the community has important impacts on host health. Cross-feeding, the sharing of metabolites between different microbes, has emergent roles in establishing communities of gut commensals that are stable, resistant to invasion, and resilient to external perturbation. In this review, we first explore the ecological and evolutionary implications of cross-feeding as a cooperative interaction. We then survey mechanisms of cross-feeding across trophic levels, from primary fermenters to H2 consumers that scavenge the final metabolic outputs of the trophic network. We extend this analysis to also include amino acid, vitamin, and cofactor cross-feeding. Throughout, we highlight evidence for the impact of these interactions on each species' fitness as well as host health. Understanding cross-feeding illuminates an important aspect of microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions that establishes and shapes our gut communities.

## Networking between helminths, microbes, and mammals.

_Animals, Humans, Helminths, Helminthiasis, Microbiota, Immune Tolerance, Host-Parasite Interactions, Mammals_
Just as mammals have coevolved with the intestinal bacterial communities that are part of the microbiota, intestinal helminths represent an important selective force on their mammalian host. The complex interaction between helminths, microbes, and their mammalian host is likely an important determinant of mutual fitness. The host immune system in particular is a critical interface with both helminths and the microbiota, and this crosstalk often determines the balance between tolerance and resistance against these widespread parasites. Hence, there are many examples of how both helminths and the microbiota can influence tissue homeostasis and homeostatic immunity. Understanding these processes at a cellular and molecular level is an exciting area of research that we seek to highlight in this review and that will potentially guide future treatment approaches.
