This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Dupilumab (Dupixent®) tends to be an effective therapy for uncontrolled severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps: real data of a single-centered, retrospective single-arm longitudinal study from a university hospital in Germany.
 15.10.2022, _F Jansen, B Becker, JK Eden, PC Breda, A Hot, T Oqueka, CS Betz, AS Hoffmann_


Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is an inflammatory disease, which is usually type 2-mediated in the western hemisphere, associated with severe therapeutic and socioeconomic challenges. The first targeted systemic treatment option for severe uncontrolled CRSwNP is a human monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) subunit called dupilumab, which was approved for subcutaneous administration in Germany in October 2019. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of dupilumab in real life in patients treated with dupilumab in label according to license in our department in 2019-2021.

## N-glycosylation of cervicovaginal fluid reflects microbial community, immune activity, and pregnancy status.
 14.10.2022, _G Wu, P Grassi, DA MacIntyre, BG Molina, L Sykes, S Kundu, CT Hsiao, KH Khoo, PR Bennett, A Dell, SM Haslam_


_Cytokines, Female, Glycosylation, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Mannose, Microbiota, Polysaccharides, Pregnancy, Premature Birth_
Human cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) is a complex, functionally important and glycan rich biological fluid, fundamental in mediating physiological events associated with reproductive health. Using a comprehensive glycomic strategy we reveal an extremely rich and complex N-glycome in CVF of pregnant and non-pregnant women, abundant in paucimannose and high mannose glycans, complex glycans with 2-4 N-Acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) antennae, and Poly-LacNAc glycans decorated with fucosylation and sialylation. N-glycosylation profiles were observed to differ in relation to pregnancy status, microbial composition, immune activation, and pregnancy outcome. Compared to CVF from women experiencing term birth, CVF from women who subsequently experienced preterm birth showed lower sialylation, which correlated to the presence of a diverse microbiome, and higher fucosylation, which correlated positively to pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration. This study is the first step towards better understanding the role of cervicovaginal glycans in reproductive health, their contribution to the mechanism of microbial driven preterm birth, and their potential for preventative therapy.
