This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Sharing of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes between Humans and Food Animals.
 11.10.2022, _H Cao, S Bougouffa, TJ Park, A Lau, MK Tong, KH Chow, PL Ho_


The prevalence and propagation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are serious global public health concerns. The large and the ever-increasing use of antibiotics in livestock is also considered a great concern. The extent of the similarity of acquired antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) between humans and food animals and the driving factors underlying AMR transfer between them are not clear, although a link between ARGs in both hosts was proposed. To address this question, with swine and chicken as examples of food animals, we analyzed over 1,000 gut metagenomes of humans and food animals from over the world. A relatively high abundance and diversity of ARGs were observed in swine compared with those in humans as a whole. Commensal bacteria, particularly species from Clostridiales, contribute the most ARGs associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and were found in both humans and food animals. Further studies demonstrate that overrepresented MGEs, namely, Tn4451/Tn4453 and TnAs3, are attributed mainly to the sharing between humans and food animals. A member of large resolvase family site-specific recombinases, TnpX, is found in Tn4451/Tn4453 which facilitates the insertions of the transient circular molecule. Although the variance in the transferability of ARGs in humans is higher than that in swine, a higher average transferability was observed in swine than that in humans. In conclusion, the potential antibiotic resistance hot spots with higher transferability in food animals observed in the present study emphasize the importance of surveillance for emerging resistance threats before they spread. IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has proven to be a global public health concern. To conquer this increasingly worrying trend, an overarching, One Health approach has been used that brings together different sectors, but the fundamental knowledge of the relationship between humans, food animals, and their environments is not mature yet or is lacking in some aspect. With swine and chicken as examples of food animals, a large global data set of over 1,000 human and food animal gut metagenomes was analyzed with a focus on acquired antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) to answer this question. Outputs from this work open a new avenue to further our understanding of ARG transferability in food animals. It is a necessary milestone to better equip governmental agencies to monitor and pre-empt antibiotic resistance hot spots. This work will assist and give guidance on how to decipher other links within any One Health initiatives with expected positive feedback to human health.

## Host-microbiome interactions: Gut-Liver axis and its connection with other organs.
 05.11.2022, _S Anand, SS Mande_


_Humans, Dysbiosis, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Liver, Bile Acids and Salts, Inflammation_
An understanding of connections between gut microbiome and liver has provided important insights into the pathophysiology of liver diseases. Since gut microbial dysbiosis increases gut permeability, the metabolites biosynthesized by them can reach the liver through portal circulation and affect hepatic immunity and inflammation. The immune cells activated by these metabolites can also reach liver through lymphatic circulation. Liver influences immunity and metabolism in multiple organs in the body, including gut. It releases bile acids and other metabolites into biliary tract from where they enter the systemic circulation. In this review, the bidirectional communication between the gut and the liver and the molecular cross talk between the host and the microbiome has been discussed. This review also provides details into the intricate level of communication and the role of microbiome in Gut-Liver-Brain, Gut-Liver-Kidney, Gut-Liver-Lung, and Gut-Liver-Heart axes. These observations indicate a complex network of interactions between host organs influenced by gut microbiome.

## Effects of different amoxicillin treatment durations on microbiome diversity and composition in the gut.

Antibiotics seize an effect on bacterial composition and diversity and have been demonstrated to induce disruptions on gut microbiomes. This may have implications for human health and wellbeing, and an increasing number of studies suggest a link between the gut microbiome and several diseases. Hence, reducing antibiotic treatments may be beneficial for human health status. Further, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing global problem that can be counteracted by limiting the usage of antibiotics. Longer antibiotic treatments have been demonstrated to increase the development of AMR. Therefore, shortening of antibiotic treatment durations, provided it is safe for patients, may be one measure to reduce AMR. In this study, the objective was to investigate effects of standard and reduced antibiotic treatment lengths on gut microbiomes using a murine model. Changes in the murine gut microbiome was assessed after using three different treatment durations of amoxicillin (3, 7 or 14 days) as well as a control group not receiving amoxicillin. Fecal samples were collected before and during the whole experiment, until three weeks past end of treatment. These were further subject for 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Our results demonstrated significant changes in bacterial diversity, richness and evenness during amoxicillin treatment, followed by a reversion in terms of alpha-diversity and abundance of major phyla, after end of treatment. However, a longer restitution time was indicated for mice receiving amoxicillin for 14 days, and phylum Patescibacteria did not fully recover. In addition, an effect on the composition of Firmicutes was indicated to last for at least three weeks in mice treated with amoxicillin for 14 days. Despite an apparently reversion to a close to original state in overall bacterial diversity and richness, the results suggested more durable changes in lower taxonomical levels. We detected several families, genera and ASVs with significantly altered abundance three weeks after exposure to amoxicillin, as well as bacterial taxa that appeared significantly affected by amoxicillin treatment length. This may strengthen the argument for shorter antibiotic treatment regimens to both limit the emergence of antibiotic resistance and risk of gut microbiome disturbance.

Host-associated microbiotas guide the trajectory of developmental programs, and altered microbiota composition is linked to neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder. Recent work suggests that microbiotas modulate behavioral phenotypes associated with these disorders. We discovered that the zebrafish microbiota is required for normal social behavior and reveal a molecular pathway linking the microbiota, microglial remodeling of neural circuits, and social behavior in this experimentally tractable model vertebrate. Examining neuronal correlates of behavior, we found that the microbiota restrains neurite complexity and targeting of forebrain neurons required for normal social behavior and is necessary for localization of forebrain microglia, brain-resident phagocytes that remodel neuronal arbors. The microbiota also influences microglial molecular functions, including promoting expression of the complement signaling pathway and the synaptic remodeling factor c1q. Several distinct bacterial taxa are individually sufficient for normal microglial and neuronal phenotypes, suggesting that host neuroimmune development is sensitive to a feature common among many bacteria. Our results demonstrate that the microbiota influences zebrafish social behavior by stimulating microglial remodeling of forebrain circuits during early neurodevelopment and suggest pathways for new interventions in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.

The development of the gut microbiome from birth plays important roles in short- and long-term health, but factors influencing preterm gut microbiome development are poorly understood. In the present study, we use metagenomic sequencing to analyse 1,431 longitudinal stool samples from 123 very preterm infants (&lt;32 weeks' gestation) who did not develop intestinal disease or sepsis over a study period of 10 years. During the study period, one cohort had no probiotic exposure whereas two cohorts were given different probiotic products: Infloran (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus) or Labinic (B. bifidum, B. longum subsp. infantis and L. acidophilus). Mothers' own milk, breast milk fortifier, antibiotics and probiotics were significantly associated with the gut microbiome, with probiotics being the most significant factor. Probiotics drove microbiome transition into different preterm gut community types (PGCTs), each enriched in a different Bifidobacterium sp. and significantly associated with increased postnatal age. Functional analyses identified stool metabolites associated with PGCTs and, in preterm-derived organoids, sterile faecal supernatants impacted intestinal, organoid monolayer, gene expression in a PGCT-specific manner. The present study identifies specific influencers of gut microbiome development in very preterm infants, some of which overlap with those impacting term infants. The results highlight the importance of strain-specific differences in probiotic products and their impact on host interactions in the preterm gut.

## Plasticity of the adult human small intestinal stoma microbiota.
 01.11.2022, _B Yilmaz, T Fuhrer, D Morgenthaler, N Krupka, D Wang, D Spari, D Candinas, B Misselwitz, G Beldi, U Sauer, AJ Macpherson_


The human distal small intestine (ileum) has a distinct microbiota, but human studies investigating its composition and function have been limited by the inaccessibility of the ileum without purging and/or deep intubation. We investigated inherent instability, temporal dynamics, and the contribution of fed and fasted states using stoma samples from cured colorectal cancer patients as a non-invasive access route to the otherwise inaccessible small and large intestines. Sequential sampling of the ileum before and after stoma formation indicated that ileostoma microbiotas represented that of the intact small intestine. Ileal and colonic stoma microbiotas were confirmed as distinct, and two types of instability in ileal host-microbial relationships were observed: inter-digestive purging followed by the rapid postprandial blooming of bacterial biomass and sub-strain appearance and disappearance within individual taxa after feeding. In contrast to the relative stability of colonic microbiota, the human small intestinal microbiota biomass and its sub-strain composition can be highly dynamic.

## MIDAS2: Metagenomic Intra-species Diversity Analysis System.
 02.11.2022, _C Zhao, B Dimitrov, M Goldman, S Nayfach, KS Pollard_


The Metagenomic Intra-Species Diversity Analysis System (MIDAS) is a scalable metagenomic pipeline that identifies single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and gene copy number variants (CNVs) in microbial populations. Here, we present MIDAS2, which addresses the computational challenges presented by increasingly large reference genome databases, while adding functionality for building custom databases and leveraging paired-end reads to improve SNV accuracy. This fast and scalable reengineering of the MIDAS pipeline enables thousands of metagenomic samples to be efficiently genotyped.

The identification of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences of Cas9 nucleases is crucial for their exploitation in genome editing. Here we develop a computational pipeline that was used to interrogate a massively expanded dataset of metagenome and virome assemblies for accurate and comprehensive PAM predictions. This procedure allows the identification and isolation of sequence-tailored Cas9 nucleases by using the target sequence as bait. As proof of concept, starting from the disease-causing mutation P23H in the RHO gene, we find, isolate and experimentally validate a Cas9 which uses the mutated sequence as PAM. Our PAM prediction pipeline will be instrumental to generate a Cas9 nuclease repertoire responding to any PAM requirement.

## Dosimetry and Toxicity Outcomes in Patients Treated with Hypofractionated Regional Nodal Irradiation for Breast Cancer: What is the Best Dose-Volume Limit to Minimize Risks of Radiation Pneumonitis?
 04.11.2022, _MD Schad, AH Richman, EJ Diego, PF McAuliffe, RR Johnson, J Steiman, JA Vargo, S Beriwal_


While published data have supported the use of hypofractionated regional nodal irradiation (HF-RNI) for breast cancer, limited dosimetric data exist to evaluate predictors of lung toxicity. The ongoing RT CHARM trial limits the percentage of ipsilateral lung volume that receives ≥ 18 Gy (V18Gy) to 35-40%. We assessed dosimetry, toxicity, and disease outcomes in patients treated with breast HF-RNI with a particular focus on pneumonitis.
