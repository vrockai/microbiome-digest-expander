Studying the microbial composition of internal organs and their associations with disease remains challenging due to the difficulty of acquiring clinical biopsies. We designed a statistical model to analyze the prevalence of species across sample types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), revealing that species equiprevalent across sample types are predominantly contaminants, bearing unique signatures from each TCGA-designated sequencing center. Removing such species mitigated batch effects and isolated the tissue-resident microbiome, which was validated by original matched TCGA samples. Gene copies and nucleotide variants can further distinguish mixed-evidence species. We, thus, present The Cancer Microbiome Atlas (TCMA), a collection of curated, decontaminated microbial compositions of oropharyngeal, esophageal, gastrointestinal, and colorectal tissues. This led to the discovery of prognostic species and blood signatures of mucosal barrier injuries and enabled systematic matched microbe-host multi-omic analyses, which will help guide future studies of the microbiome's role in human health and disease.

## Sensitive universal detection of blood parasites by selective pathogen-DNA enrichment and deep amplicon sequencing.
 05.01.2021, _BR Flaherty, J Barratt, M Lane, E Talundzic, RS Bradbury_


Targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) has enabled characterization of diverse bacterial communities, yet the application of TADS to communities of parasites has been relatively slow to advance. The greatest obstacle to this has been the genetic diversity of parasitic agents, which include helminths, protozoa, arthropods, and some acanthocephalans. Meanwhile, universal amplification of conserved loci from all parasites without amplifying host DNA has proven challenging. Pan-eukaryotic PCRs preferentially amplify the more abundant host DNA, obscuring parasite-derived reads following TADS. Flaherty et al. (2018) described a pan-parasitic TADS method involving amplification of eukaryotic 18S rDNA regions possessing restriction sites only in vertebrates. Using this method, host DNA in total DNA extracts could be selectively digested prior to PCR using restriction enzymes, thereby increasing the number of parasite-derived reads obtained following NGS. This approach showed promise though was only as sensitive as conventional PCR.

The aim was to describe the safety of indefinite administration of antibiotics, the so-called suppressive antibiotic therapy (SAT) and to provide insight into their impact on gut microbiota. 17 patients with SAT were recruited, providing a fecal sample. Bacterial composition was determined by 16S rDNA massive sequencing, and their viability was explored by PCR-DGGE with and without propidium monoazide. Presence of antibiotic multirresistant bacteria was explored through the culture of feces in selective media. High intra-individual variability in the genera distribution regardless of the antibiotic or antibiotic administration ingestion period, with few statistically significant differences detected by Bray-Curtis distance-based principle component analysis, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis. However, the microbiota composition of patients treated with both beta-lactams and sulfonamides clustered by a heat map. Curiously, the detection of antibiotic resistant bacteria was almost anecdotic and CTX-M-15-producing E. coli were detected in two subjects. Our work demonstrates the overall clinical safety of SAT and the low rate of the selection of multidrug-resistant bacteria triggered by this therapy. We also describe the composition of intestinal microbiota under the indefinite use of antibiotics for the first time.
