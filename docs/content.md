## Bacteriophage-Bacteria Interactions in the Gut: From Invertebrates to Mammals.
 13.07.2021, _JM Kirsch, RS Brzozowski, D Faith, JL Round, PR Secor, BA Duerkop_


Bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages or phages) interact antagonistically and beneficially in polymicrobial communities such as the guts of animals. These interactions are multifaceted and are influenced by environmental conditions. In this review, we discuss phage-bacteria interactions as they relate to the complex environment of the gut. Within the mammalian and invertebrate guts, phages and bacteria engage in diverse interactions including genetic coexistence through lysogeny, and phages directly modulate microbiota composition and the immune system with consequences that are becoming recognized as potential drivers of health and disease. With greater depth of understanding of phage-bacteria interactions in the gut and the outcomes, future phage therapies become possible. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Virology, Volume 8 is September 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

## Identification and engraftment of new bacterial strains by shotgun metagenomic sequence analysis in patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection before and after fecal microbiota transplantation and in healthy human subjects.
 12.07.2021, _S Verma, SK Dutta, E Firnberg, L Phillips, R Vinayek, PP Nair_


Recurrent Clostridioides diffícile infection (RCDI) is associated with major bacterial dysbiosis and colitis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective therapeutic modality for RCDI. While several studies have identified bacterial species associated with resolution of symptoms in patients, characterization of the fecal microbiome at the bacterial strain level in RCDI patients before and after FMT and healthy donors, has been lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of bacterial strains from healthy donors to engraft in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with RCDI following FMT.

## Comparative analysis of oral-gut microbiota between captive and wild long-tailed macaque in Thailand.
 13.07.2021, _V Sawaswong, K Praianantathavorn, P Chanchaem, A Khamwut, T Kemthong, Y Hamada, S Malaivijitnond, S Payungporn_


Long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), distributed in Southeast Asia, are generally used in biomedical research. At present, the expansion of human communities overlapping of macaques' natural habitat causes human-macaque conflicts. To mitigate this problem in Thailand, the National Primate Research Center of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University (NPRCT-CU), was granted the permit to catch the surplus wild-born macaques and transfer them to the center. Based on the fact that the diets provided and the captive environments were different, their oral-gut microbiota should be altered. Thus, we investigated and compared the oral and fecal microbiome between wild-born macaques that lived in the natural habitats and those transferred to and reared in the NPRCT-CU for 1 year. The results from 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing showed that the captive macaques had distinct oral-gut microbiota profiles and lower bacterial richness compared to those in wild macaques. The gut of wild macaques was dominated by Firmicutes which is probably associated with lipid absorption and storage. These results implicated the effects of captivity conditions on the microbiome that might contribute to crucial metabolic functions. Our study should be applied to the animal health care program, with respect to microbial functions, for non-human primates.

## Impact of the dietary inclusion of dried food residues on the apparent nutrient digestibility and the intestinal microbiota of dogs.
 13.07.2021, _N Paßlack, F Galliou, T Manios, K Lasaridi, E Tsiplakou, W Vahjen, J Zentek_


The use of food residues for animal nutrition might imply ecological and economic advantages; however, their effects as a potential ingredient have not yet been evaluated in dogs. In the present study, four diets with 0, 5, 10 and 15% dried food residues (DFR), derived from hotel catering, were fed to 10 healthy adult dogs. At the end of each three-week feeding period, faeces and blood were collected. The apparent nutrient digestibility was calculated by the dietary inclusion of titanium dioxide as an inert marker. The results demonstrated that the apparent crude protein digestibility and ether extract digestibility decreased with increasing amounts of DFR in the diets (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, an increase of the faecal concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) was observed (p &lt; 0.05). Faecal ammonium and lactate concentrations, as well as plasma phenol and indole concentrations, were not linearly affected by the dietary inclusion of DFR. The relative abundance of Fusobacteria in the faeces of the dogs decreased, and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased with increasing amounts of DFR in the diets (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the DFR seemed to be intensively fermented by the intestinal microbiota of the dogs, as indicated by the increased faecal SCFA concentrations and the shifts in the composition of the faecal microbiota. Dietary inclusion levels of up to 5% can be recommended based on our results, as the observed lower apparent crude protein and ether extract digestibility might limit the use of food residues for dogs at higher amounts.

## Triphenyltin exposure causes changes in health-associated gut microbiome and metabolites in marine medaka.
 14.07.2021, _S He, D Yu, P Li, M Zhang, S Xing, C Sun, ZH Li_


Triphenyltin (TPT), an organic compound with a wide range of applications, is often detected in water bodies and aquatic animals. However, the mechanism underlying the biological metabolic health problems caused by long-term exposure to environment concentrations of TPT remains unclear. The morphology and gene expression in the gut and liver were investigated; and 16SrRNA gene amplification sequencing and non-targeted LC-MS/MS metabonomics were investigated after marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was treated with 1, 10, and 100 ng/L TPT for 21 days. During prolonged exposure to TPT, the adaptation mechanism maximized the energy of absorption, increased the length of intestinal microvilli, reduced the number of rough endoplasmic reticulum in the liver, and caused loss of weight. TPT exposure significantly changed the intestinal microbiome of marine medaka, thereby resulting in a significant decrease in microbial diversity. Following exposure to 100 ng/L TPT, the metabolic profiles were significantly changed and the altered metabolites were mainly concentrated in the lipid metabolic pathway. Finally, based on comprehensive network analysis, the association between the significantly changed bacteria and metabolites contributed further to the prediction of the impact of TPT on the host. This study provides a novel insight into the underlying mechanisms of host metabolic diseases caused by TPT and emphasizes the importance of monitoring pollutants in the environment.

_Animals, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Cresols, Fecal Microbiota Transplantation, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Mice_
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, changes in microbiota composition as well as in the fecal, serum, and urine levels of microbial metabolites. Yet a causal relationship between dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and ASD remains to be demonstrated. Here, we hypothesized that the microbial metabolite p-Cresol, which is more abundant in ASD patients compared to neurotypical individuals, could induce ASD-like behavior in mice.

## Seven years of Progress in Determining Fungal Diversity and Characterization of Fungi Isolated from the Japanese Experiment Module KIBO, International Space Station.
 12.07.2021, _K Satoh, MM Alshahni, Y Umeda, A Komori, T Tamura, Y Nishiyama, T Yamazaki, K Makimura_


The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed facility that orbits the earth carrying not only its crew but also microorganisms. We have participated in microbiota analysis projects for the Japanese Experiment Module KIBO, ISS (operations nomenclature: Microbe-I, II, III, and IV) and were in charge of fungal screening. The interior of KIBO was sampled using swabs and microbe detection sheets (MDS) for fungal detection. The dominant genera obtained by culture were Aspergillus and Penicillium. DNA analyses of the fungal biota using a clone library showed that KIBO was dominated by Malassezia, a fungal inhabitant of human skin. Three fungal species, Aspergillus sydowii, Penicillium palitans, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, which grew under microgravity in KIBO were observed under field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on the ground. No novel phenotypic characteristics were noted. The results of antifungal susceptibility testing of all isolates did not differ significantly from previous reports of corresponding fungi. In Microbe-I (August 2009), MDS were culture negative, while in the next stages the CFU of MDS were 10 for Microbe-II (February 2011), 24 for Microbe-III (October 2012), and 151 for Microbe-IV (February 2016). These results indicated that fungi inside KIBO are increasing and expanding over time, and therefore continuous surveillance is crucial. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

## Virome studies of food production systems: time for 'farm to fork' analyses.
 12.07.2021, _J Mahony, D van Sinderen_


The food industry is under increasing pressure to produce high quality, traceable and minimally processed foods that are produced using sustainable approaches and ingredients. In line with the latter, there is an increased pressure for plant-based products to replace animal-derived products. Until recently, research efforts have mainly focused on dairy and meat products owing to their economic importance. The shift towards plant-based diets and food production requires a corresponding shift in research efforts to define the microbial requirements for and composition of (novel) plant-based foods, the (micro)organisms that are beneficial to such production systems, and the abundance and role of (bacterio)phages in shaping the microbial landscape of these foods. In this review, we explore current efforts in the area of virome analysis of foods and food production environments and highlight the need for more unified approaches to understand the contribution of phages in food safety and quality, and to develop novel tools to enhance the traceability of foods.

## D-MANOVA: fast distance-based multivariate analysis of variance for large-scale microbiome association studies.
 13.07.2021, _J Chen, X Zhang_


PERMANOVA (permutational multivariate analysis of variance based on distances) has been widely used for testing the association between the microbiome and a covariate of interest. Statistical significance is established by permutation, which is computationally intensive for large sample sizes. As large-scale microbiome studies such as American Gut Project (AGP) become increasingly popular, a computationally efficient version of PERMANOVA is much needed. To achieve this end, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the PERMANOVA pseudo-F statistic and provide analytical p-value calculation based on chi-square approximation. We show that the asymptotic p-value is close to the PERMANOVA p-value even under a moderate sample size. Moreover, it is more accurate and an order-of-magnitude faster than the permutation-free method MDMR. We demonstrated the use of our procedure D-MANOVA on the AGP dataset.

## Umibato: estimation of time-varying microbial interaction using continuous-time regression hidden Markov model.
 13.07.2021, _S Hosoda, T Fukunaga, M Hamada_


Accumulating evidence has highlighted the importance of microbial interaction networks. Methods have been developed for estimating microbial interaction networks, of which the generalized Lotka-Volterra equation (gLVE)-based method can estimate a directed interaction network. The previous gLVE-based method for estimating microbial interaction networks did not consider time-varying interactions.

## Characterizing Microbiomes via Sequencing of Marker Loci: Techniques To Improve Throughput, Account for Cross-Contamination, and Reduce Cost.
 13.07.2021, _JG Harrison, GD Randolph, CA Buerkle_


New approaches to characterizing microbiomes via high-throughput sequencing provide impressive gains in efficiency and cost reduction compared to approaches that were standard just a few years ago. However, the speed of method development has been such that staying abreast of the latest technological advances is challenging. Moreover, shifting laboratory protocols to include new methods can be expensive and time consuming. To facilitate adoption of new techniques, we provide a guide and review of recent advances that are relevant for single-locus sequence-based study of microbiomes-from extraction to library preparation-including a primer regarding the use of liquid-handling automation in small-scale academic settings. Additionally, we describe several amendments to published techniques to improve throughput, track contamination, and reduce cost. Notably, we suggest adding synthetic DNA molecules to each sample during nucleic acid extraction, thus providing a method of documenting incidences of cross-contamination. We also describe a dual-indexing scheme for Illumina sequencers that allows multiplexing of many thousands of samples with minimal PhiX input. Collectively, the techniques that we describe demonstrate that laboratory technology need not impose strict limitations on the scale of molecular microbial ecology studies. IMPORTANCE New methods to characterize microbiomes reduce technology-imposed limitations to study design, but many new approaches have not been widely adopted. Here, we present techniques to increase throughput and reduce contamination alongside a thorough review of current best practices.

## Two-Target Quantitative PCR To Predict Library Composition for Shallow Shotgun Sequencing.
 13.07.2021, _MY Cho, M Oliva, A Spreafico, B Chen, X Wei, Y Choi, R Kaul, LL Siu, B Coburn, PHH Schneeberger_


When determining human microbiota composition, shotgun sequencing is a powerful tool that can generate high-resolution taxonomic and functional information at once. However, the technique is limited by missing information about host-to-microbe ratios observed in different body compartments. This limitation makes it difficult to plan shotgun sequencing assays, especially in the context of high sample multiplexing and limited sequencing output and is of particular importance for studies employing the recently described shallow shotgun sequencing technique. In this study, we evaluated the use of a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based assay to predict host-to-microbe ratio prior to sequencing. Combining a two-target assay involving the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the human beta-actin gene, we derived a model to predict human-to-microbe ratios from two sample types, including stool samples and oropharyngeal swabs. We then validated it on two independently collected sample types, including rectal swabs and vaginal secretion samples. This assay enabled accurate prediction in the validation set in a range of sample compositions between 4% and 98% nonhuman reads and observed proportions varied between -18.8% and +19.2% from the expected values. We hope that this easy-to-use assay will help researchers to plan their shotgun sequencing experiments in a more efficient way. IMPORTANCE When determining human microbiota composition, shotgun sequencing is a powerful tool that can generate large amounts of data. However, in sample compositions with low or variable microbial density, shallowing sequencing can negatively affect microbial community metrics. Here, we show that variable sequencing depth decreases measured alpha diversity at differing rates based on community composition. We then derived a model that can determine sample composition prior to sequencing using quantitative PCR (qPCR) data and validated the model using a separate sample set. We have included a tool that uses this model to be available for researchers to use when gauging shallow sequencing viability of samples.

## Statistical approaches for differential expression analysis in metatranscriptomics.
 13.07.2021, _Y Zhang, KN Thompson, C Huttenhower, EA Franzosa_


Metatranscriptomics (MTX) has become an increasingly practical way to profile the functional activity of microbial communities in situ. However, MTX remains underutilized due to experimental and computational limitations. The latter are complicated by non-independent changes in both RNA transcript levels and their underlying genomic DNA copies (as microbes simultaneously change their overall abundance in the population and regulate individual transcripts), genetic plasticity (as whole loci are frequently gained and lost in microbial lineages) and measurement compositionality and zero-inflation. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of and recommendations for differential expression (DE) analysis in MTX.

## In vitro models of gut digestion across childhood: current developments, challenges and future trends.
 12.07.2021, _E Fournier, C Roussel, A Dominicis, D Ley, MA Peyron, V Collado, M Mercier-Bonin, C Lacroix, M Alric, T Van de Wiele, C Chassard, L Etienne-Mesmin, S Blanquet-Diot_


The human digestion is a multi-step and multi-compartment process essential for human health, at the heart of many issues raised by academics, the medical world and industrials from the food, nutrition and pharma fields. In the first years of life, major dietary changes occur and are concomitant with an evolution of the whole child digestive tract anatomy and physiology, including colonization of gut microbiota. All these phenomena are influenced by child exposure to environmental compounds, such as drugs (especially antibiotics) and food pollutants, but also childhood infections. Due to obvious ethical, regulatory and technical limitations, in vivo approaches in animal and human are more and more restricted to favor complementary in vitro approaches. This review summarizes current knowledge on the evolution of child gut physiology from birth to 3 years old regarding physicochemical, mechanical and microbial parameters. Then, all the available in vitro models of the child digestive tract are described, ranging from the simplest static mono-compartmental systems to the most sophisticated dynamic and multi-compartmental models, and mimicking from the oral phase to the colon compartment. Lastly, we detail the main applications of child gut models in nutritional, pharmaceutical and microbiological studies and discuss the limitations and challenges facing this field of research.
