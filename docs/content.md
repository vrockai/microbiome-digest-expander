The early microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract can have long-term impacts on development and health. Keystone species, including Bacteroides spp., are prominent in early life and play crucial roles in maintaining the structure of the intestinal ecosystem. However, the process by which a resilient community is curated during early life remains inadequately understood. Here, we show that a single sialidase, NanH, in Bacteroides fragilis mediates stable occupancy of the intestinal mucosa in early life and regulates a commensal colonization program. This program is triggered by sialylated glycans, including those found in human milk oligosaccharides and intestinal mucus. NanH is required for vertical transmission from dams to pups and promotes B. fragilis dominance during early life. Furthermore, NanH facilitates commensal resilience and recovery after antibiotic treatment in a defined microbial community. Collectively, our study reveals a co-evolutionary mechanism between the host and microbiota mediated through host-derived glycans to promote stable colonization.

The multitude of barriers between the mouth and colon may eliminate swallowed oral bacteria. Ascertaining the presence of the same bacteria in the mouth and colon is methodologically challenging partly because 16S rRNA gene sequencing - the most commonly used method to characterize the human microbiota - has low confidence in taxonomic assignments deeper than genus for most bacteria. As different species of the same genus can have low-level variation across the same 16S rRNA gene region, shotgun sequencing is needed to identify a true overlap. We analyzed a curated, multi-cohort, shotgun metagenomic database with species-level taxonomy and clade-specific marker genes to fill this knowledge gap. Using 500 paired fecal/oral (4 oral sites) samples from 4 healthy adult cohorts, we found a minute overlap between the two niches. Comparing marker genes between paired oral and fecal samples with species-level overlap, the pattern of overlap in only 7 individuals was consistent with same-strain colonization. These findings argue against ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the distal gut in healthy adults.

## Positioning the preventive potential of microbiome treatments for cystic fibrosis in the context of current therapies.
 17.01.2024, _E Cauwenberghs, I De Boeck, I Spacova, I Van Tente, J Bastiaenssen, E Lammertyn, S Verhulst, K Van Hoorenbeeck, S Lebeer_


Antibiotics and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators play a pivotal role in cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment, but both have limitations. Antibiotics are linked to antibiotic resistance and disruption of the airway microbiome, while CFTR modulators are not widely accessible, and structural lung damage and pathogen overgrowth still occur. Complementary strategies that can beneficially modulate the airway microbiome in a preventive way are highly needed. This could be mediated via oral probiotics, which have shown some improvement of lung function and reduction of airway infections and exacerbations, as a cost-effective approach. However, recent data suggest that specific and locally administered probiotics in the respiratory tract might be a more targeted approach to prevent pathogen outgrowth in the lower airways. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the CF airway microbiome and possibilities of microbiome treatments to prevent bacterial and/or viral infections and position them in the context of current CF therapies.

## The gut microbiota modulate locomotion via vagus-dependent glucagon-like peptide-1 signaling.

Locomotor activity is an innate behavior that can be triggered by gut-motivated conditions, such as appetite and metabolic condition. Various nutrient-sensing receptors distributed in the vagal terminal in the gut are crucial for signal transduction from the gut to the brain. The levels of gut hormones are closely associated with the colonization status of the gut microbiota, suggesting a complicated interaction among gut bacteria, gut hormones, and the brain. However, the detailed mechanism underlying gut microbiota-mediated endocrine signaling in the modulation of locomotion is still unclear. Herein, we show that broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (ABX)-treated mice displayed hypolocomotion and elevated levels of the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Blockade of the GLP-1 receptor and subdiaphragmatic vagal transmission rescued the deficient locomotor phenotype in ABX-treated mice. Activation of the GLP-1 receptor and vagal projecting brain regions led to hypolocomotion. Finally, selective antibiotic treatment dramatically increased serum GLP-1 levels and decreased locomotion. Colonizing Lactobacillus reuteri and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in microbiota-deficient mice suppressed GLP-1 levels and restored the hypolocomotor phenotype. Our findings identify a mechanism by which specific gut microbes mediate host motor behavior via the enteroendocrine and vagal-dependent neural pathways.

## Nonylphenol induces depressive behavior in rats and affects gut microbiota: A dose-dependent effect.
 16.01.2024, _J Pan, D Lu, L Yu, Z Ye, H Duan, A Narbad, J Zhao, Q Zhai, F Tian, W Chen_


Nonylphenol (NP), an endocrine disruptor absorbed through food intake, was investigated in this study for its potential dose-response relationship with the manifestation of depression-like behavior in rats. Based on this, the mechanisms of NP-induced depressive behavior, encompassing neurotransmitters, gut barrier function, inflammatory response, gut microbiota composition and metabolites were further explored. At medium and high NP doses, both mRNA and protein levels of zonula occludens protein-1 and claudin-1 were considerably downregulated, concomitant with an elevation in tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β expression in a dose-dependent effect, resulting in damage to the gut mucosa. Despite a minimal impact on behavior and gut barriers at low NP doses, alterations in gut microbiota composition were observed. During NP exposure, dose-dependent changes in the gut microbiota revealed a decline in microbial diversity linked to the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids. NP not only adversely affected the gut microbiota structure but also exacerbated central nervous system damage through the gut-brain axis. The accumulation of NP may cause neurotransmitter disturbances and inflammatory responses in the hippocampus, which also exacerbate depressed behavior in rats. Therefore, NP could exacerbate the inflammatory response in the hippocampus and colon by compromising intestinal barrier integrity, facilitating the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria, impairing butyrate metabolism, and perturbing neurotransmitter homeostasis, thus aggravating the depressive behavior of rats. It is noteworthy that the changes in these indicators were related to the NP exposure dose.

The visual organ plays a crucial role in sensing environmental information. However, its mucosal surfaces are constantly exposed to selective pressures from aquatic or airborne pathogens and microbial communities. Although few studies have characterized the conjunctival-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) in the ocular mucosa (OM) of birds and mammals, little is known regarding the evolutionary origins and functions of immune defense and microbiota homeostasis of the OM in the early vertebrates.

The rhizosheath, a cohesive soil layer firmly adhering to plant roots, plays a vital role in facilitating water and mineral uptake. In pearl millet, rhizosheath formation is genetically controlled and influenced by root exudates. Here, we investigated the impact of root exudates on the microbiota composition, interactions, and assembly processes, and rhizosheath structure in pearl millet using four distinct lines with contrasting soil aggregation abilities.

Antarctica and its unique biodiversity are increasingly at risk from the effects of global climate change and other human influences. A significant recent element underpinning strategies for Antarctic conservation has been the development of a system of Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (ACBRs). The datasets supporting this classification are, however, dominated by eukaryotic taxa, with contributions from the bacterial domain restricted to Actinomycetota and Cyanobacteriota. Nevertheless, the ice-free areas of the Antarctic continent and the sub-Antarctic islands are dominated in terms of diversity by bacteria. Our study aims to generate a comprehensive phylogenetic dataset of Antarctic bacteria with wide geographical coverage on the continent and sub-Antarctic islands, to investigate whether bacterial diversity and distribution is reflected in the current ACBRs.

The Illumina HiSeq platform has been a commonly used option for bacterial genome sequencing. Now the BGI DNA nanoball (DNB) nanoarrays platform may provide an alternative platform for sequencing of bacterial genomes. To explore the impact of sequencing platforms on bacterial genome assembly, quality assessment, sequence alignment, functional annotation, mutation detection, and metagenome mapping, we compared genome assemblies based on sequencing of cultured bacterial species using the HiSeq 2000 and BGISEQ-500 platforms. In addition, simulated reads were used to evaluate the impact of insert size on genome assembly. Genome assemblies based on BGISEQ-500 sequencing exhibited higher completeness and fewer N bases in high GC genomes, whereas HiSeq 2000 assemblies exhibited higher N50. The majority of assembly assessment parameters, sequences of 16S rRNA genes and genomes, numbers of single nucleotide variants (SNV), and mapping to metagenome data did not differ significantly between platforms. More insertions were detected in HiSeq 2000 genome assemblies, whereas more deletions were detected in BGISEQ-500 genome assemblies. Insert size had no significant impact on genome assembly. Taken together, our results suggest that DNBSEQ platforms would be a valid substitute for HiSeq 2000 for bacterial genome sequencing.
