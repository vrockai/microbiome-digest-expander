## Schizasterid Heart Urchins Host Microorganisms in a Digestive Symbiosis of Mesozoic Origin.
 14.08.2020, _A Ziegler, AM Gilligan, JG Dillon, B Pernet_


Because of their lifestyles, abundance, and feeding habits, infaunal marine deposit feeders have a significant impact on the ocean floor. As these animals also ingest microorganisms associated with their sediment and seawater diet, their digestive tract usually contains a diverse array of bacteria. However, while most of these microorganisms are transients, some may become part of a resident gut microbiome, in particular when sheltered from the main flow of digesta in specialized gut compartments. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of the structure and contents of the intestinal caecum (IC), a hindgut diverticulum found exclusively in schizasterid heart urchins (Echinoidea: Spatangoida: Schizasteridae). Based on specimens of Brisaster townsendi, in addition to various other schizasterid taxa, our structural characterization of the IC shows that the organ is a highly specialized gut compartment with unique structural properties. Next generation sequencing shows that the IC contains a microbial population composed predominantly of Bacteroidales, Desulfobacterales, and Spirochaetales. The microbiome of this gut compartment is significantly different in composition and lower in diversity than the microbial population in the sediment-filled main digestive tract. Inferences on the function and evolution of the IC and its microbiome suggest that this symbiosis plays a distinct role in host nutrition and that it evolved at least 66 million years ago during the final phase of the Mesozoic.

## Evidence for contamination as the origin for bacteria found in human placenta rather than a microbiota.
 10.08.2020, _R Gschwind, T Fournier, S Kennedy, V Tsatsaris, AG Cordier, F Barbut, MJ Butel, S Wydau-Dematteis_


Until recently the in utero environment of pregnant women was considered sterile. Recent high-sensitivity molecular techniques and high-throughput sequencing lead to some evidence for a low-biomass microbiome associated with the healthy placenta. Other studies failed to reveal evidence for a consistent presence of bacteria using either culture or molecular based techniques. Comparing conflicting "placental microbiome" studies is complicated by the use of varied and inconsistent protocols. Given this situation, we undertook an evaluation of the in utero environment sterility using several controlled methods, in the same study, to evaluate the presence or absence of bacteria and to explain contradictions present in the literature. Healthy pregnant women (n = 38) were recruited in three maternity wards. Placenta were collected after cesarean section with or without Alexis® and vaginal delivery births. For this study we sampled fetal membranes, umbilical cord and chorionic villi. Bacterial presence was analyzed using bacterial culture and qPCR on 34 fetal membranes, umbilical cord and chorionic villi samples. Shotgun metagenomics was performed on seven chorionic villi samples. We showed that the isolation of meaningful quantities of viable bacteria or bacterial DNA was possible only outside the placenta (fetal membranes and umbilical cords) highlighting the importance of sampling methods in studying the in utero environment. Bacterial communities described by metagenomics analysis were similar in chorionic villi samples and in negative controls and were dependent on the database chosen for the analysis. We conclude that the placenta does not harbor a specific, consistent and functional microbiota.

## Genomic and enzymatic evidence of acetogenesis by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea.
 10.08.2020, _S Yang, Y Lv, X Liu, Y Wang, Q Fan, Z Yang, N Boon, F Wang, X Xiao, Y Zhang_


Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mediated by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) is the primary process that provides energy to cold seep ecosystems by converting methane into inorganic carbon. Notably, cold seep ecosystems are dominated by highly divergent heterotrophic microorganisms. The role of the AOM process in supporting heterotrophic population remains unknown. We investigate the acetogenic capacity of ANME-2a in a simulated cold seep ecosystem using high-pressure biotechnology, where both AOM activity and acetate production are detected. The production of acetate from methane is confirmed by isotope-labeling experiments. A complete archaeal acetogenesis pathway is identified in the ANME-2a genome, and apparent acetogenic activity of the key enzymes ADP-forming acetate-CoA ligase and acetyl-CoA synthetase is demonstrated. Here, we propose a modified model of carbon cycling in cold seeps: during AOM process, methane can be converted into organic carbon, such as acetate, which further fuels the heterotrophic community in the ecosystem.

## Undinarchaeota illuminate DPANN phylogeny and the impact of gene transfer on archaeal evolution.
 10.08.2020, _N Dombrowski, TA Williams, J Sun, BJ Woodcroft, JH Lee, BQ Minh, C Rinke, A Spang_


The recently discovered DPANN archaea are a potentially deep-branching, monophyletic radiation of organisms with small cells and genomes. However, the monophyly and early emergence of the various DPANN clades and their role in life's evolution are debated. Here, we reconstructed and analysed genomes of an uncharacterized archaeal phylum (Candidatus Undinarchaeota), revealing that its members have small genomes and, while potentially being able to conserve energy through fermentation, likely depend on partner organisms for the acquisition of certain metabolites. Our phylogenomic analyses robustly place Undinarchaeota as an independent lineage between two highly supported 'DPANN' clans. Further, our analyses suggest that DPANN have exchanged core genes with their hosts, adding to the difficulty of placing DPANN in the tree of life. This pattern can be sufficiently dominant to allow identifying known symbiont-host clades based on routes of gene transfer. Together, our work provides insights into the origins and evolution of DPANN and their hosts.
