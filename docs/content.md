## Probiotic-fermented tomato alleviates high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice: Insights from microbiome and metabolomics.

Probiotic-fermented plant-based foods are associated with weight loss. Here, we hypothesized probiotic-fermented tomato (FT) as a functional food with potential to alleviate obesity, thus the obesity-alleviating effects and mechanisms of FT on high-fat diet-induced obese mice were explored via biochemical, gut microbiome, and serum metabolomics analysis. The results showed that FT performed better than unfermented tomato in reducing body weight gain and fat accumulation, improving dyslipidemia and glucose homeostasis, and relieving inflammation and adipocytokine dysregulation. Particularly, live probiotic-fermented tomato (LFT) was associated with improved diversity, composition, and structure of gut microbiota, suppressed obesity-related genera growth (e.g., Clostridium, Olsenella, and Mucispirillum), and promoted beneficial genera growth (e.g., Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Oscillospira), which were associated negatively with body weight, TC, TG, and TNF-α levels. Additionally, LFT was associated with positive changes in glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, unsaturated fatty acids, and amino acids levels. Collectively, as a functional food, LFT possessed potential for obesity alleviation.
