Respiratory failure and mortality from COVID-19 result from virus- and inflammation-induced lung tissue damage. The intestinal microbiome and associated metabolites are implicated in immune responses to respiratory viral infections, however their impact on progression of severe COVID-19 remains unclear. We prospectively enrolled 71 patients with COVID-19 associated critical illness, collected fecal specimens within 3 days of medical intensive care unit admission, defined microbiome compositions by shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and quantified microbiota-derived metabolites (NCT #04552834). Of the 71 patients, 39 survived and 32 died. Mortality was associated with increased representation of Proteobacteria in the fecal microbiota and decreased concentrations of fecal secondary bile acids and desaminotyrosine (DAT). A microbiome metabolic profile (MMP) that accounts for fecal secondary bile acids and desaminotyrosine concentrations was independently associated with progression of respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation. Our findings demonstrate that fecal microbiota composition and microbiota-derived metabolite concentrations can predict the trajectory of respiratory function and death in patients with severe SARS-Cov-2 infection and suggest that the gut-lung axis plays an important role in the recovery from COVID-19.

## The intestinal barrier in disorders of the central nervous system.
 05.11.2022, _C Pellegrini, M Fornai, V D'Antongiovanni, L Antonioli, N Bernardini, P Derkinderen_


The intestinal barrier, which primarily consists of a mucus layer, an epithelial barrier, and a gut vascular barrier, has a crucial role in health and disease by facilitating nutrient absorption and preventing the entry of pathogens. The intestinal barrier is in close contact with gut microbiota on its luminal side and with enteric neurons and glial cells on its tissue side. Mounting evidence now suggests that the intestinal barrier is compromised not only in digestive disorders, but also in disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder, depression, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. After providing an overview of the structure and functions of the intestinal barrier, we review existing preclinical and clinical studies supporting the notion that intestinal barrier dysfunction is present in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. On the basis of this evidence, we discuss the mechanisms that possibly link gut barrier dysfunction and CNS disorders and the potential impact that evaluating enteric barriers in brain disorders could have on clinical practice, in terms of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, in the near future.

## Resistance is futile? Mucosal immune mechanisms in the context of microbial ecology and evolution.
 06.11.2022, _E Slack, M Diard_


In the beginning it was simple: we injected a protein antigen and studied the immune responses against the purified protein. This elegant toolbox uncovered thousands of mechanisms via which immune cells are activated. However, when we consider immune responses against real infectious threats, this elegant simplification misses half of the story: the infectious agents are typically evolving orders-of-magnitude faster than we are. Nowhere is this more pronounced than in the mammalian large intestine. A bacterium representing only 0.1% of the human gut microbiota will have a population size of 109 clones, each actively replicating. Moreover, the evolutionary pressure from other microbes is at least as profound as direct effects of the immune system. Therefore, to really understand intestinal immune mechanisms, we need to understand both the host response and how rapid microbial evolution alters the apparent outcome of the response. In this review we use the examples of intestinal inflammation and secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) to highlight what is already known (Fig. 1). Further, we will explore how these interactions can inform immunotherapy and prophylaxis. This has major implications for how we design effective mucosal vaccines against increasingly drug-resistant bacterial pathogens Fig. 1 THE IMMUNE RESPONSE SHAPES THE FITNESS LANDSCAPE IN THE GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT.: The red arrows depict possible evolutionary paths of a novel colonizer along adaptive peaks in the intestinal fitness landscapes that change with the status of the host immune system. The flat surfaces represent the non-null fitness baselines (values x or y) at which a bacterium can establish at minimum carrying capacity. a In the healthy gut, metabolic competence, resistance to aggressions by competitors and predators, swift adaptation to rapid fluctuations as well as surviving acidic pH and the flow of the intestinal content, represent potent selective pressures and as many opportunities for bacteria to increase fitness by phenotypic or genetic variations. b When pathogens trigger acute inflammation, bacteria must adapt to iron starvation, killing by immune cells and antimicrobial peptides, and oxidative stress, while new metabolic opportunities emerge. c When high-affinity SIgA are produced against a bacterium, e.g., after oral vaccination, escape of SIgA by altering or losing surface epitopes becomes crucial for maximum fitness. However, escaping polyvalent SIgA responses after vaccination with "evolutionary trap" vaccines leads to evolutionary trade-offs: A fitness maximum is reached in the vaccinated host gut that represents a major disadvantage for transmission into na√Øve hosts (fitness diminished below x) (d).

## A critical analysis of eating disorders and the gut microbiome.
 04.11.2022, _SM Terry, JA Barnett, DL Gibson_


The gut microbiota, also known as our "second brain" is an exciting frontier of research across a multitude of health domains. Gut microbes have been implicated in feeding behaviour and obesity, as well as mental health disorders including anxiety and depression, however their role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders (EDs) has only recently been considered. EDs are complex mental health conditions, shaped by a complicated interplay of factors. Perhaps due to an incomplete understanding of the etiology of EDs, treatment remains inadequate with affected individuals likely to face many relapses. The gut microbiota may be a missing piece in understanding the etiology of eating disorders, however more robust scientific inquiry is needed in the field before concrete conclusions can be made. In this spotlight paper, we critically evaluate what is known about the bi-directional relationship between gut microbes and biological processes that are implicated in the development and maintenance of EDs, including physiological functioning, hormones, neurotransmitters, the central nervous system, and the immune system. We outline limitations of current research, propose concrete steps to move the field forward and, hypothesize potential clinical implications of this research. Our gut is inhabited by millions of bacteria which have more recently been referred to as "our second brain". In fact, these microbes are thought to play a role in ED behaviour, associated anxiety and depression, and even affect our weight. Recent research has dove into this field with promising findings that have the potential to be applied clinically to improve ED recovery. The present paper discusses what is known about the gut microbiome in relation to EDs and the promising implications that leveraging this knowledge, through fecal microbiome transplants, probiotics, and microbiome-directed supplemental foods, could have on ED treatment.

## Genetic and environmental circadian disruption induce weight gain through changes in the gut microbiome.
 05.11.2022, _B Altaha, M Heddes, V Pilorz, Y Niu, E Gorbunova, M Gigl, K Kleigrewe, H Oster, D Haller, S Kiessling_


Internal clocks time behavior and physiology, including the gut microbiome, in a circadian (‚àº24 h) manner. Mismatch between internal and external time, e.g. during shift work, disrupts circadian system coordination promoting the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Conversely, body weight changes induce microbiota dysbiosis. The relationship between circadian disruption and microbiota dysbiosis in metabolic diseases, however, remains largely unknown.

## Strains producing different short-chain fatty acids alleviate DSS-induced ulcerative colitis by regulating intestinal microecology.
 03.11.2022, _S Yang, J Shang, L Liu, Z Tang, X Meng_


Probiotics have long been shown to modulate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a variety of ways, and their major metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), have been shown to play a role in the alleviation of ulcerative colitis (UC). In the present study, DSS-treated C57BL/6J mice were gavaged with Bifidobacterium bifidum H3-R2, Propionibacterium freudenreichii B1 and Clostridium butyricum C1-6, which are capable of high production of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, respectively. We measured the effects of these three strains on inflammatory factors, intestinal barrier function, colitis-related signalling pathways, intestinal microbiome composition, and SCFA content in intestinal contents. The results of the experiment showed that all three strains differentially increased the colon length; reduced weight loss; decreased the splenic index; decreased the DAI scores and MPO activity; decreased proinflammatory factor levels (IL-8, IL-1Œ≤ and TNF-Œ±); increased anti-inflammatory factor production (IL-10); and enhanced tight junction protein expression (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1). Moreover, Bifidobacterium bifidum H3-R2 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii B1 played crucial roles through TLRs/RHO kinase (ROCK1) and Wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathways in these protective effects. In addition, three strains improved the composition of the intestinal flora and increased the production of SCFAs; notably, Propionibacterium freudenreichii B1 had the best effect. This study provides a scientific basis for the further application of probiotics in the treatment of UC in the future.

## Microbiome assembly and maintenance across the lifespan of bumble bee workers.
 05.11.2022, _TJ Hammer, A Easton-Calabria, NA Moran_


How a host's microbiome changes over its lifespan can influence development and aging. As these temporal patterns have only been described in detail for a handful of hosts, an important next step is to compare microbiome succession more broadly and investigate why it varies. Here we characterize the temporal dynamics and stability of the bumble bee worker gut microbiome. Bumble bees have simple and host-specific gut microbiomes, and their microbial dynamics may influence health and pollination services. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing, qPCR, and metagenomics to characterize gut microbiomes over the lifespan of Bombus impatiens workers. We also sequenced gut transcriptomes to examine host factors that may control the microbiome. At the community level, microbiome assembly is highly predictable and similar to patterns of primary succession observed in the human gut. But at the strain level, partitioning of bacterial variants among colonies suggests stochastic colonization events similar to those observed in flies and nematodes. We also find strong differences in temporal dynamics among symbiont species, suggesting ecological differences among microbiome members in colonization and persistence. Finally, we show that both the gut microbiome and host transcriptome-including expression of key immunity genes-stabilize, as opposed to senesce, with age. We suggest that in highly social groups such as bumble bees, maintenance of both microbiomes and immunity contribute to the inclusive fitness of workers, and thus remain under selection even in old age. Our findings provide a foundation for exploring the mechanisms and functional outcomes of bee microbiome succession.

## The gut microbiome reflects ancestry despite dietary shifts across a hybrid zone.
 04.11.2022, _DP Nielsen, JG Harrison, NW Byer, TM Faske, TL Parchman, WB Simison, MD Matocq_


The microbiome is critical to an organism's phenotype, and its composition is shaped by, and a driver of, eco-evolutionary interactions. We investigated how host ancestry, habitat and diet shape gut microbial composition in a mammalian hybrid zone between Neotoma lepida and N. bryanti that occurs across an ecotone between distinct vegetation communities. We found that habitat is the primary determinant of diet, while host genotype is the primary determinant of the gut microbiome-a finding further supported by intermediate microbiome composition in first-generation hybrids. Despite these distinct primary drivers, microbial richness was correlated with diet richness, and individuals that maintained higher dietary richness had greater gut microbial community stability. Both relationships were stronger in the relative dietary generalist of the two parental species. Our findings show that host ancestry interacts with dietary habits to shape the microbiome, ultimately resulting in the phenotypic plasticity that host-microbial interactions allow.

## Sampling from four geographically divergent young female populations demonstrates forensic geolocation potential in microbiomes.
 06.11.2022, _T Clarke, L Brinkac, C Greco, AT Alleyne, P Carrasco, C Inotroza, T Tau, W Wisitrasameewong, MG Torralba, K Nelson, H Singh_


Studies of human microbiomes using new sequencing techniques have increasingly demonstrated that their ecologies are partly determined by the lifestyle and habits of individuals. As such, significant forensic information could be obtained from high throughput sequencing of the human microbiome. This approach, combined with multiple analytical techniques demonstrates that bacterial DNA can be used to uniquely identify an individual and to provide information about their life and behavioral patterns. However, the transformation of these findings into actionable forensic information, including the geolocation of the samples, remains limited by incomplete understanding of the effects of confounding factors and the paucity of diverse sequences. We obtained 16S rRNA sequences of stool and oral microbiomes collected from 206 young and healthy females from four globally diverse populations, in addition to supporting metadata, including dietary and medical information. Analysis of these microbiomes revealed detectable geolocation signals between the populations, even for populations living within the same city. Accounting for other lifestyle variables, such as diet and smoking, lessened but does not remove the geolocation signal.

## Insights into the potential for mutualistic and harmful host-microbe interactions affecting brown alga freshwater acclimation.
 03.11.2022, _H KleinJan, C Frioux, G Califano, M Aite, E Fremy, E Karimi, E Corre, T Wichard, A Siegel, C Boyen, SM Dittami_


Microbes can modify their hosts' stress tolerance, thus potentially enhancing their ecological range. An example of such interactions is Ectocarpus subulatus, one of the few freshwater-tolerant brown algae. This tolerance is partially due to its (un)cultivated microbiome. We investigated this phenomenon by modifying the microbiome of laboratory-grown E. subulatus using mild antibiotic treatments, which affected its ability to grow in low salinity. Low salinity acclimation of these algal-bacterial associations was then compared. Salinity significantly impacted bacterial and viral gene expression, albeit in different ways across algal-bacterial communities. In contrast, gene expression of the host and metabolite profiles were affected almost exclusively in the freshwater-intolerant algal-bacterial communities. We found no evidence of bacterial protein production that would directly improve algal stress tolerance. However, vitamin K synthesis is one possible bacterial service missing specifically in freshwater-intolerant cultures in low salinity. In this condition, we also observed a relative increase in bacterial transcriptomic activity and the induction of microbial genes involved in the biosynthesis of the autoinducer AI-1, a quorum-sensing regulator. This could have resulted in dysbiosis by causing a shift in bacterial behavior in the intolerant algal-bacterial community. Together, these results provide two promising hypotheses to be examined by future targeted experiments. Although they apply only to the specific study system, they offer an example of how bacteria may impact their host's stress response.

## Microplastics in urban waters and its effects on microbial communities: a critical review.
 03.11.2022, _S Entezari, MA Al, A Mostashari, H Ganjidoust, B Ayati, J Yang_


Microplastic (MP) pollution is one of the emerging threats to the water and terrestrial environment, forcing a new environmental challenge due to the growing trend of plastic released into the environment. Synthetic and non-synthetic plastic components can be found in rivers, lakes/reservoirs, oceans, mountains, and even remote areas, such as the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets. MPs' main challenge is identifying, measuring, and evaluating their impacts on environmental behaviors, such as carbon and nutrient cycles, water and wastewater microbiome, and the associated side effects. However, until now, no standardized methodical protocols have been proposed for comparing the results of studies in different environments, especially in urban water and wastewater. This review briefly discusses MPs' sources, fate, and transport in urban waters and explains methodological uncertainty. The effects of MPs on urban water microbiomes, including urban runoff, sewage wastewater, stagnant water in plumbing networks, etc., are also examined in depth. Furthermore, this study highlights the pathway of MPs and their transport vectors to different parts of ecosystems and human life, particularly through mediating microbial communities, antibiotic-resistant genes, and biogeochemical cycles. Overall, we have briefly highlighted the present research gaps, the lack of appropriate policy for evaluating microplastics and their interactions with urban water microbiomes, and possible future initiatives.
