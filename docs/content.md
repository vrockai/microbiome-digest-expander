Oral mucositis (OM) is a prevalent and painful complication in patients undergoing anticancer treatment, which significantly impacts patients' quality of life (QoL) and adherence to therapy. The use of oral probiotics as a preventive strategy for OM has shown promise, but the clinical evidence remains inconclusive. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aims to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preventing OM caused by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.
