There are increasing data about the role of the gut microbiome in various autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated disease. Current treatment strategies in psoriasis include immunomodulating biologic agents. A variable response to this type of therapy has been reported in psoriatic patients. A possible effect of biologic therapy on the gut microbiome composition has been suggested, but data are still limited. The aim of this study was to compare the gut microbiome composition between psoriatic patients treated and untreated with biologic drugs in order to identify differences which may highlight the potential impact of the treatment on the gut microbiome. 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were performed on the fecal samples of 30 psoriatic patients with similar clinicopathological features, 10 of whom were undergoing biologic therapy and 20 not receiving systemic therapy. Alpha and beta diversity significantly differed between the two groups of patients. A reduced bacterial biodiversity in the group of treated patients compared with the group of untreated patients was observed. Differential relative abundances of key gut microbial communities, including Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides plebeius, were identified between the two groups of patients. This study showed that biologic therapy may have an impact on the composition of the gut microbiome of psoriatic patients. Gut microbiome composition could be used as an indicator of response to therapy and the modulation of the microbial composition could help to restore the intestinal symbiosis in psoriatic patients.

## Bacterial response to soil property changes caused by wood ash from wildfire in forest soils around mining areas: Relevance of bacterial community composition, carbon and nitrogen cycling.

The different physical-chemical properties of the black ash (200-500 °C) and white ash (&gt;510 °C) generated by wildfire may result in varied impacts on soil biological and abiotic indicators. Many studies have highlighted the environmental impacts of wood ash application due to its complex mixture of beneficial and detrimental compounds. However, few studies have compared the effect of black ash and white ash on soil, especially for the heavy metal polluted soil. In this study, we used the comparative analysis of parallel microcosm experiments to study the impacts of white ash and black ash on bioavailable heavy metals and metabolic potentials of microbial community. The results indicated that both white ash and black ash increased the concentration of soil bioavailable As and Cr, while the increasing trend of bioavailable As could be limited by Ca in the treatment of white ash. The addition of black ash could enhance the abundance of genes related to the Calvin cycle (CBB). Different kinds of wood ash inputs into soils could cause the differences in the microbial taxa for carbon fixation, as indicated by the dominance of different taxa for carbon fixation in white ash versus black ash treatments. Additionally, both white ash and black ash impaired dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), nitrate assimilation and nitrification, while white ash enhanced denitrification.
