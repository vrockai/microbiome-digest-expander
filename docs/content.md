 29.12.2020, _Y Sun, L Cheng, X Zeng, X Zhang, Y Liu, Z Wu, P Weng_


As an invisible organ of human body, the gut microbiota plays an important role in human life and has become a hot spot in the field of life science in recent years. Due to the increasing pressure of work and life, people are prone to depression. The in-depth mechanism studies indicated that the gut microbiota could improve the depression symptom through the gut-brain axis (GBA). As unique plant polysaccharides, dietary fiber can effectively modulate the intestinal flora disorders and its crucial role in orchestrating host-microbiota crosstalk has been confirmed. This review highlights the mechanisms that the gut microbiota affects the development of depression through GBA and focuses on dietary fiber intervention on the improvement of intestinal microbiota imbalance, which may provide new ideas for the prevention and treatment of depression.

## Effects of Metformin on the Gut Microbiota in Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
 28.12.2020, _Q Zhang, N Hu_


Metformin is a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Gut microbiota affect the development and progression of T2DM. In recent years, an increasing number of studies has focused on the relationship between metformin and gut microbiota, suggesting that metformin might exert part of its hypoglycemic effect through these microbes. However, most of these results were not consistent due to the complex composition of the microbiota, the differences between species, the large variation between individuals, and the differences in experimental design, bringing great obstacle for our better understanding of the effects of metformin on the gut microbiota. Here, we reviewed the published papers concerning about the impacts of metformin on the gut microbiota of mice, rats, and humans with obesity or T2DM, and summarized the changes of gut microbiota composition caused by metformin and the possible underlying hypoglycemic mechanism which is related to gut microbiota. It was found that the proportions of some microbiota, such as phyla Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia and genera Akkermansia, Bacteroides and Escherichia, were significantly affected by metformin in several studies. Metformin may exert part of hypoglycemic effects by altering the gut microbiota in ways that maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier, promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), regulate bile acid metabolism, and improve glucose homeostasis.

## Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis as a Regulator of Reward Processes.
 28.12.2020, _R García-Cabrerizo, C Carbia, KJ O Riordan, H Schellekens, JF Cryan_


Our gut harbours trillions of microorganisms essential for the maintenance of homeostasis and host physiology in health and disease. In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in understanding the bidirectional pathway of communication between our microbiota and the central nervous system. With regard to reward processes there is accumulating evidence from both animal and human studies that this axis may be a key factor in gating reward valence. Focusing on the mesocorticolimbic pathway, we will discuss how the intestinal microbiota is involved in regulating brain reward functions, both in natural (i.e., eating, social or sexual behaviours) and non-natural reinforcers (drug addiction behaviours including those relevant to alcohol, psychostimulants, opioids and cannabinoids). We will integrate preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that the microbiota-gut-brain axis could be implicated in the development of disorders associated with alterations in the reward system and how it may be targeted as a promising therapeutic strategy.

## Gut microbiota and systemic immunity in health and disease.
 28.12.2020, _BC Lo, GY Chen, G Núñez, R Caruso_


The mammalian intestine is colonized by trillions of microorganisms that have co-evolved with the host in a symbiotic relationship. Although the influence of the gut microbiota on intestinal physiology and immunity is well known, mounting evidence suggests a key role for intestinal symbionts in controlling immune cell responses and development outside the gut. Although the underlying mechanisms by which the gut symbionts influence systemic immune responses remain poorly understood, there is evidence for both direct and indirect effects. In addition, the gut microbiota can contribute to immune responses associated with diseases outside the intestine. Understanding the complex interactions between the gut microbiota and the host is thus of fundamental importance to understand both immunity and human health.

## The alteration and potential relationship of vaginal microbiota and chemokines for unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion.
 29.12.2020, _T Fan, XM Zhong, XC Wei, ZL Miao, SY Luo, H Cheng, Q Xiao_


The diagnosis and treatment of unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) is an important and hot topic in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. During our clinical investigation (observation), we have found that URSA patients usually experience recurrent vaginitis or vaginal dysbacteriosis during periods of non-pregnancy, pregnancy, and post-abortion. However, there is no research on vaginal dysbacteriosis's influence on URSA. Using women with normal induced abortion as a control group, and using 16S rRNA sequencing, which helps to screen differentially expressed flora, this study discusses the relevance between differential bacteria at the genus level and the incidence of URSA. Another aim of this study is to determine whether certain pathogenic genera can cause an imbalance in immune tolerance of the maternal and fetal interface through regulatory chemokines, which leads to recurrent spontaneous abortion. This article has explored URSA pathogenesis from the perspective of differentially expressed vaginal flora, which has great theoretical significance for the early diagnosis and treatment of URSA.

## Plant roots employ cell-layer-specific programs to respond to pathogenic and beneficial microbes.

Plant roots are built of concentric cell layers that are thought to respond to microbial infections by employing specific, genetically defined programs. Yet, the functional impact of this radial organization remains elusive, particularly due to the lack of genome-wide techniques for monitoring expression at a cell-layer resolution. Here, cell-type-specific expression of tagged ribosomes enabled the isolation of ribosome-bound mRNA to obtain cell-layer translatomes (TRAP-seq, translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA sequencing). After inoculation with the vascular pathogen Verticillium longisporum, pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora parasitica, or mutualistic endophyte Serendipita indica, root cell-layer responses reflected the fundamentally different colonization strategies of these microbes. Notably, V. longisporum specifically suppressed the endodermal barrier, which restricts fungal progression, allowing microbial access to the root central cylinder. Moreover, localized biosynthesis of antimicrobial compounds and ethylene differed in response to pathogens and mutualists. These examples highlight the power of this resource to gain insights into root-microbe interactions and to develop strategies in crop improvement.

## A cross-species interaction with a symbiotic commensal enables cell-density-dependent growth and in vivo virulence of an oral pathogen.
 29.12.2020, _A Hoare, H Wang, A Meethil, L Abusleme, BY Hong, NM Moutsopoulos, PD Marsh, G Hajishengallis, PI Diaz_


Recent studies describe in detail the shifts in composition of human-associated polymicrobial communities from health to disease. However, the specific processes that drive the colonization and overgrowth of pathogens within these communities remain incompletely understood. We used in vitro culture systems and a disease-relevant mouse model to show that population size, which determines the availability of an endogenous diffusible small molecule, limits the growth, colonization, and in vivo virulence of the human oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. This bacterial pathogen overcomes the requirement for an endogenous cue by utilizing a cell-density dependent, growth-promoting, soluble molecule provided by the symbiotic early colonizer Veillonella parvula, but not produced by other commensals tested. Our work shows that exchange of cell-density-dependent diffusible cues between specific early and late colonizing species in a polymicrobial community drives microbial successions, pathogen colonization and disease development, representing a target process for manipulation of the microbiome towards the healthy state.
