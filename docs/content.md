 29.03.2022, _SL La Rosa, MP Ostrowski, A Vera-Ponce de León, LS McKee, J Larsbrink, VG Eijsink, EC Lowe, EC Martens, PB Pope_


Microbiomes and their enzymes process many of the nutrients accessible in the gastrointestinal tract of bilaterians and play an essential role in host health and nutrition. In this review, we describe recent insights into nutrient processing in microbiomes across three exemplary yet contrasting gastrointestinal ecosystems (humans, ruminants and insects), with focus on bacterial mechanisms for the utilization of common and atypical dietary glycans as well as host-derived mucus glycans. In parallel, we discuss findings from multi-omic studies that have provided new perspectives on understanding glycan-dependent interactions and the complex food-webs of microbial populations in their natural habitat. Using key examples, we emphasize how increasing understanding of glycan processing by gut microbiomes can provide critical insights to assist 'microbiome reprogramming', a growing field that seeks to leverage diet to improve animal growth and host health.

## Microbial differences between active and remission peri-implantitis.
 29.03.2022, _Y Hashimoto, S Okada, K Yasuda, M Kawagoe, M Kajiya, K Tsuga_


Peri-implantitis has a polymicrobial etiology and is a major cause of dental implant loss. Various clinical protocols for its prevention and treatment have been proposed; however, some cases show a rapid progression with non-resolving clinical symptoms. To clear a means of differentiating between such cases, the implants with peri-implantitis in this study were categorized as the active group and the remission group and that two kinds of samples were obtained from the same subjects (n = 20). The microbiome was analyzed through pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. From LEfSe results, Porphyomonas, Fusobacterium, Treponema, Tannerella, and other periodontal pathogens were abundant in the active group, while lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillales and Bifidobacterium) were abundant in the remission group.

Temporal dynamics of the gut microbiota potentially limit the identification of microbial features associated with health status. Here, we used whole-genome metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the intra- and inter-individual variations of gut microbiota composition and functional potential of a disease-free Swedish population (n = 75) over one year. We found that 23% of the total compositional variance was explained by intra-individual variation. The degree of intra-individual compositional variability was negatively associated with the abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (a butyrate producer) and two Bifidobacterium species. By contrast, the abundance of facultative anaerobes and aerotolerant bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus varied extensively, independent of compositional stability. The contribution of intra-individual variance to the total variance was greater for functional pathways than for microbial species. Thus, reliable quantification of microbial features requires repeated samples to address the issue of intra-individual variations of the gut microbiota.

## Microbiota-microglia connections in age-related cognition decline.
 29.03.2022, _R Zhou, S Qian, WCS Cho, J Zhou, C Jin, Y Zhong, J Wang, X Zhang, Z Xu, M Tian, LWC Chan, H Zhang_


Aging is an inevitable process that all individuals experience, of which the extent differs among individuals. It has been recognized as the risk factor of neurodegenerative diseases by affecting gut microbiota compositions, microglia, and cognition abilities. Aging-induced changes in gut microbiota compositions have a critical role in orchestrating the morphology and functions of microglia through the gut-brain axis. Gut microbiota communicates with microglia by its secreted metabolites and neurotransmitters. This is highly associated with age-related cognitive declines. Here, we review the main composition of microbiota in the aged individuals, outline the changes of the brain in age-related cognitive decline from a neuroinflammation perspective, especially the changes of morphology and functions of microglia, discuss the crosstalk between microbiota and microglia in the aged brain and further highlight the role of microbiota-microglia connections in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease).

## Insights from shotgun metagenomics into bacterial species and metabolic pathways associated with NAFLD in obese youth.
 28.03.2022, _T Testerman, Z Li, B Galuppo, J Graf, N Santoro_


Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease and is often the precursor for more serious liver conditions such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. Although the gut microbiome has been implicated in the development of NAFLD, the strong association of obesity with NAFLD and its effect on microbiome structure has made interpreting study outcomes difficult. In the present study, we examined the taxonomic and functional differences between the microbiomes of youth with obesity and with and without NAFLD. Shotgun metagenome sequencing was performed to profile the microbiomes of 36 subjects, half of whom were diagnosed with NAFLD using abdominal magnetic resonance imaging. Beta diversity analysis showed community-wide differences between the groups (p = 0.002). Specific taxonomic differences included increased relative abundances of the species Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans (p = 0.042), Romboutsia ilealis (p = 0.046), and Actinomyces sp. ICM47 (p = 0.0009), and a decrease of Bacteroides thetaiotamicron (p = 0.0002), in the NAFLD group as compared with the non-NAFLD group. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes (p &lt; 0.0001) was decreased in the NAFLD group. Functionally, branched-chain amino acid (p = 0.01343) and aromatic amino acid (p = 0.01343) synthesis pathways had increased relative abundances in the NAFLD group along with numerous energy use pathways, including pyruvate fermentation to acetate (p = 0.01318). Conclusion: Community-wide differences were noted based on NAFLD status, and individual bacterial species along with specific metabolic pathways were identified as potential drivers of these differences. The results of the present study support the idea that the NAFLD phenotype displays a differentiated microbial and functional signature from the obesity phenotype.

## Dietary Patterns and Gut Microbiota: the Crucial Actors in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
 29.03.2022, _P He, L Yu, F Tian, H Zhang, W Chen, Q Zhai_


It is widely believed that diet and the gut microbiota are strongly related to the occurrence and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the effects of the interaction between dietary patterns and the gut microbiota on IBD have not been well elucidated. In this paper, we aim to explore the complex relationship between dietary patterns, gut microbiota, and IBD. We first comprehensively summarize the dietary patterns associated with IBD and found that dietary patterns can modulate the occurrence and progression of IBD through various signaling pathways, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Besides, the gut microbiota performs a vital role in the progression of IBD, which can affect the expression of IBD susceptibility genes, such as dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) and apolipoprotein A1 (APOAI), the intestinal barrier (in particular, the expression of tight junction proteins), immune function (especially the homeostasis between effector and regulatory T cells) and the physiological metabolism, in particular, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs) and tryptophan metabolisms. Finally, we review the current knowledge on the interaction between dietary patterns and the gut microbiota in IBD and found that dietary patterns modulate the onset and progression of IBD, which is partly attributed to the regulation of the gut microbiota (especially SCFAs-producing bacteria and Escherichia coli). Faecalibacteria as "microbiomarkers" of IBD could be used as a target for dietary interventions to alleviate IBD. A comprehensive understanding of the interplay between dietary intake, gut microbiota, and IBD, which will facilitate the development of personalized dietary strategies based on the regulation of the gut microbiota in IBD and to expedite the era of precision nutritional interventions for IBD.

## A Guide to Dietary Pattern-Microbiome Data Integration.
 29.03.2022, _Y Choi, SL Hoops, CJ Thoma, AJ Johnson_


The human gut microbiome is linked to metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. Dietary modulation of the human gut microbiome offers an attractive pathway to manipulate the microbiome to prevent microbiome-related disease. However, this promise has not been realized. The complex system of diet and microbiome interactions is poorly understood. Integrating observational human diet and microbiome data can help researchers and clinicians untangle the complex systems of interactions that predict how the microbiome will change in response to foods. The use of dietary patterns to assess diet-microbiome relations holds promise to identify interesting associations and result in findings that can directly translate into actionable dietary intake recommendations and eating plans. In this article, we first highlight the complexity inherent in both dietary and microbiome data and introduce the approaches generally used to explore diet and microbiome simultaneously in observational studies. Second, we review the food group and dietary pattern-microbiome literature focusing on dietary complexity-moving beyond nutrients. Our review identified a substantial and growing body of literature that explores links between the microbiome and dietary patterns. However, there was very little standardization of dietary collection and assessment methods across studies. The 54 studies identified in this review used ≥7 different methods to assess diet. Coupled with the variation in final dietary parameters calculated from dietary data (e.g., dietary indices, dietary patterns, food groups, etc.), few studies with shared methods and assessment techniques were available for comparison. Third, we highlight the similarities between dietary and microbiome data structures and present the possibility that multivariate and compositional methods, developed initially for microbiome data, could have utility when applied to dietary data. Finally, we summarize the current state of the art for diet-microbiome data integration and highlight ways dietary data could be paired with microbiome data in future studies to improve the detection of diet-microbiome signals.

## Functional Significance of Different Milk Constituents in Modulating the Gut Microbiome and Infant Health.
 24.03.2022, _M Yadav, A Kapoor, A Verma, K Ambatipudi_


Human milk, the gold standard for optimal nourishment, controls the microbial composition of infants by either enhancing or limiting bacterial growth. The milk fat globule membrane has gained interest in gut-related functions and cognitive development. The membrane proteins can directly interact with probiotic bacteria, influencing their survival and adhesion through gastrointestinal transit, whereas membrane phospholipids increase the residence time of probiotic bacteria in the gut. The commensal bacteria in milk act as the initial inoculum in building up the gut colonization of an infant, whereas oligosaccharides promote proliferation of beneficial microorganisms. Interestingly, milk extracellular vesicles are also involved in influencing the microbiota composition but are not well-explored. This review highlights the contribution of different milk components in modulating the infant gut microbiota, particularly the fat globule membrane, and the complex interplay between host- and brain-gut microbiota signaling affecting infant and adult health positively.

## The gut microbiome as mediator between diet and its impact on immune function.
 29.03.2022, _H Shi, R Ter Horst, S Nielen, M Bloemendaal, M Jaeger, I Joosten, H Koenen, LAB Joosten, LJS Schweren, AA Vasquez, MG Netea, J Buitelaar_


Dietary habits may affect inflammatory status in humans. Here we explore this interaction as well as the potential mediating role of the gut microbiome (GM), given that the GM is both involved in processing of dietary components and influences the immune system. A cross-sectional analysis of a sample of 482 healthy participants (207 males and 275 females) was performed. Dietary intake was assessed by a semiquantitative food questionnaire. Adipokines and soluble inflammatory mediators were assayed with multiple immunoassays and ELISA. Microbial DNA was extracted from frozen stool samples of 471 participants. Polychoric correlation analysis was used to establish dietary patterns, and joint multivariate associations between these dietary patterns and immune biomarkers were studied using regression analyses with adjustment for sex, age, BMI, smoking, education levels and physical exercise and other dietary patterns. Non-parametric entropy mediation was applied to investigate whether diet-immune relationships are mediated by abundance of microbial species. In this cohort, we identified three dietary patterns, characterized as "high-meat" (meat and sweetened drink), "prudent diet" (fish, fruit, legumes and vegetables) and "high alcohol" (higher alcohol consumption). Higher adherence to prudent diet was associated with a higher adiponectin level. The high alcohol pattern was associated with high concentrations of circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, VEGF). Dialister invisus was found to mediate the relationship between a prudent dietary pattern and adiponectin, AAT, CRP, IL-6, and VEGF. In conclusion, a meat-based diet and a diet with high alcohol consumption were associated with high concentrations of biomarkers of chronic low-grade inflammation, and conversely, a prudent diet was associated with anti-inflammatory biomarkers. Diet-inflammation regulation may differ between sexes. Mediation analyses revealed that the association between prudent diet and immune function was partially mediated by the GM. The study adds to our understanding of the associations between diet, the immune system and the GM in a healthy population.

To clarify the influence of HIV on the intestinal flora and the interrelationship with CD4 T cells, the present study collected stool specimens from 33 HIV patients and 28 healthy subjects to compare the differences in the intestinal flora and CD4 T cells in a 16S rDNA-sequencing approach. ELISA was used to detect the expressions of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Meanwhile, correlation analysis with the different bacterial populations in each group was carried out. The results revealed that Alpha diversity indices of the intestinal flora of HIV patients were markedly lower than that of the healthy group (p &lt; 0.05). The top five bacterial species in the HIV group were Bacteroides (23.453%), Prevotella (19.237%), Fusobacterium (12.408%), Lachnospira (3.811%), and Escherichia-Shigella (3.126%). Spearman correlation analysis results indicated that Fusobacterium_mortiferum, Fusobacterium, and Gammaproteobacteria were positively correlated with TNF-α (p &lt; 0.05), whereas Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidales was negatively correlated with TNF-α (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, Agathobacter was positively correlated with contents of IL-2 and IL-8 (p &lt; 0.05), whereas Prevotellaceae, and Prevotella were negatively correlated with IL-8 content (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the top five strains in the CD4 high group (≥350/mm3) included Bacteroides (23.286%), Prevotella (21.943%), Fusobacterium (10.479%), Lachnospira (4.465%), and un_f_Lachnospiraceae (2.786%). Taken together, the present study identified that Fusobacterium and Escherichia-Shigella were specific and highly abundant in the HIV group and a correlation between the different bacterial flora and the contents of IL-2, IL-8, and TNF-α was revealed.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic disease of clinical importance, whose prevalence has increased in Brazil and worldwide. Among the possible factors involved in the genesis and control of the disease, the intestinal microbiota (IM) deserves to be highlighted, but studies that report differences between the IM of patients with T1DM and those who are healthy are still contradictory and scarce.

## Prophylactic effects of hyperforin on anhedonia-like phenotype in chronic restrain stress model: A role of gut microbiota.
 29.03.2022, _Z Zhang, C Yao, M Li, LC Wang, W Huang, QJ Chen_


Anhedonia is the core symptom of depression, which largely reflects the therapeutic effect of depression. Hypericum perforatum is one of the most important antidepressant herb that has fewer side effects than traditional antidepressants. Considering the antibacterial effect of Hypericum perforatum, we verified whether this antidepressant activity was related to intestinal microbiomics. So we established anhedonia mouse model to explore the underlying treatment mechanism of hyperforin, the key antidepressant ingredient of Hypericum perforatum and to screen new psychobiotics based on hyperforin. It was found that hyperforin prevented anhedonia induced by chronic restraint stress in mice, and altered the richness and evenness of bacteria populations compared to stressed mice. Metastat analysis showed that Akkermansia muciniphila and Muribaculum intestinale were the bacterial species obviously affected by hyperforin, and their abundance in hyperforin treated group significantly increased. The results suggest that the effect of hyperforin on anhedonia may be partly assisted by Akkermansia muciniphila. These also indicate that Muribaculum intestinale may be another important intestinal bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of anhedonia symptom and depression.

## Microbiome applications for laying hen performance and egg production.
 29.03.2022, _SC Ricke, DK Dittoe, EG Olson_


Management of laying hens has undergone considerable changes in the commercial egg industry. Shifting commercial production from cage-based systems to cage-free has impacted the housing environment and created issues not previously encountered. Sources of microorganisms that become established in the early stages of layer chick development may originate from the hen and depend on the microbial ecology of the reproductive tract. Development of the layer hen GIT microbiota appears to occur in stages as the bird matures. Several factors can impact the development of the layer hen GIT, including pathogens, environment, and feed additives such as antibiotics. In this review, the current status of the laying hen GIT microbial consortia and factors that impact the development and function of these respective microbial populations will be discussed, as well as future research directions.

## Inhibitory Bacterial Diversity and Mucosome Function Differentiate Susceptibility of Appalachian Salamanders to Chytrid Fungal Infection.
 29.03.2022, _RR Jiménez, A Carfagno, L Linhoff, B Gratwicke, DC Woodhams, LS Chafran, MC Bletz, B Bishop, CR Muletz-Wolz_


Mucosal defenses are crucial in animals for protection against pathogens and predators. Host defense peptides (antimicrobial peptides, AMPs) as well as skin-associated microbes are key components of mucosal immunity, particularly in amphibians. We integrate microbiology, molecular biology, network-thinking, and proteomics to understand how host and microbially derived products on amphibian skin (referred to as the mucosome) serve as pathogen defenses. We studied defense mechanisms against chytrid pathogens, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal), in four salamander species with different Batrachochytrium susceptibilities. Bd infection was quantified using qPCR, mucosome function (i.e., ability to kill Bd or Bsal zoospores in vitro), skin bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the role of Bd-inhibitory bacteria in microbial networks across all species. We explored the presence of candidate-AMPs in eastern newts and red-backed salamanders. Eastern newts had the highest Bd prevalence and mucosome function, while red-back salamanders had the lowest Bd prevalence and mucosome function, and two-lined salamanders and seal salamanders were intermediates. Salamanders with highest Bd infection intensity showed greater mucosome function. Bd infection prevalence significantly decreased as putative Bd-inhibitory bacterial richness and relative abundance increased on hosts. In co-occurrence networks, some putative Bd-inhibitory bacteria were found as hub-taxa, with red-backs having the highest proportion of protective hubs and positive associations related to putative Bd-inhibitory hub bacteria. We found more AMP candidates on salamanders with lower Bd susceptibility. These findings suggest that salamanders possess distinct innate mechanisms that affect chytrid fungi. IMPORTANCE How host mucosal defenses interact, and influence disease outcome is critical in understanding host defenses against pathogens. A more detailed understanding is needed of the interactions between the host and the functioning of its mucosal defenses in pathogen defense. This study investigates the variability of chytrid susceptibility in salamanders and the innate defenses each species possesses to mediate pathogens, thus advancing the knowledge toward a deeper understanding of the microbial ecology of skin-associated bacteria and contributing to the development of bioaugmentation strategies to mediate pathogen infection and disease. This study improves the understanding of complex immune defense mechanisms in salamanders and highlights the potential role of the mucosome to reduce the probability of Bd disease development and that putative protective bacteria may reduce likelihood of Bd infecting skin.

The gut microbiota and its metabolic end-products act in close collaboration with the nutrient metabolism of the animal. A relationship between excess adiposity and alterations in gut microbiota composition has been identified in humans and rodents, but data are scarce for overweight dogs. This study compared composition and temporal variations of gut microbiota in healthy lean and spontaneously overweight dogs. The analysis was based on three individual fresh faeces samples from each dog during a 10-day period. Twenty-seven healthy and intact male Labrador retriever dogs were included, 12 of which were classified as lean (body condition score (BCS) 4-5 on a 9-point scale) and 15 as overweight (BCS 6-8). Gut microbiota was analysed by Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.

## Alterations in common marmoset gut microbiome associated with duodenal strictures.
 29.03.2022, _A Sheh, SC Artim, MA Burns, JA Molina-Mora, MA Lee, J Dzink-Fox, S Muthupalani, JG Fox_


Chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases are the most common diseases in captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Despite standardized housing, diet and husbandry, a recently described gastrointestinal syndrome characterized by duodenal ulcers and strictures was observed in a subset of marmosets sourced from the New England Primate Research Center. As changes in the gut microbiome have been associated with GI diseases, the gut microbiome of 52 healthy, non-stricture marmosets (153 samples) were compared to the gut microbiome of 21 captive marmosets diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer/stricture (57 samples). No significant changes were observed using alpha diversity metrics, and while the community structure was significantly different when comparing beta diversity between healthy and stricture cases, the results were inconclusive due to differences observed in the dispersion of both datasets. Differences in the abundance of individual taxa using ANCOM, as stricture-associated dysbiosis was characterized by Anaerobiospirillum loss and Clostridium perfringens increases. To identify microbial and serum biomarkers that could help classify stricture cases, we developed models using machine learning algorithms (random forest, classification and regression trees, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors) to classify microbiome, serum chemistry or complete blood count (CBC) data. Random forest (RF) models were the most accurate models and correctly classified strictures using either 9 ASVs (amplicon sequence variants), 4 serum chemistry tests or 6 CBC tests. Based on the RF model and ANCOM results, C. perfringens was identified as a potential causative agent associated with the development of strictures. Clostridium perfringens was also isolated by microbiological culture in 4 of 9 duodenum samples from marmosets with histologically confirmed strictures. Due to the enrichment of C. perfringens in situ, we analyzed frozen duodenal tissues using both 16S microbiome profiling and RNAseq. Microbiome analysis of the duodenal tissues of 29 marmosets from the MIT colony confirmed an increased abundance of Clostridium in stricture cases. Comparison of the duodenal gene expression from stricture and non-stricture marmosets found enrichment of genes associated with intestinal absorption, and lipid metabolism, localization, and transport in stricture cases. Using machine learning, we identified increased abundance of C. perfringens, as a potential causative agent of GI disease and intestinal strictures in marmosets.

Elucidating the spatial structure of host-associated microbial communities is essential for understanding taxon-taxon interactions within the microbiota and between microbiota and host. Macroalgae are colonized by complex microbial communities, suggesting intimate symbioses that likely play key roles in both macroalgal and bacterial biology, yet little is known about the spatial organization of microbes associated with macroalgae. Canopy-forming kelp are ecologically significant, fixing teragrams of carbon per year in coastal kelp forest ecosystems. We characterized the micron-scale spatial organization of bacterial communities on blades of the kelp Nereocystis luetkeana using fluorescence in situ hybridization and spectral imaging with a probe set combining phylum-, class-, and genus-level probes to localize and identify &gt; 90% of the microbial community.

Cryoconite granules are mineral-microbial aggregates found on glacier surfaces worldwide and are hotspots of biogeochemical reactions in glacier ecosystems. However, despite their importance within glacier ecosystems, the geographical diversity of taxonomic assemblages and metabolic potential of cryoconite communities around the globe remain unclear. In particular, the genomic content of cryoconite communities on Asia's high mountain glaciers, which represent a substantial portion of Earth's ice masses, has rarely been reported. Therefore, in this study, to elucidate the taxonomic and ecological diversities of cryoconite bacterial consortia on a global scale, we conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing of cryoconite acquired from a range of geographical areas comprising Polar (Arctic and Antarctic) and Asian alpine regions.

On the front lines of climate change, glacier termini play crucial roles in linking glaciers and downstream ecosystems during glacier retreat. However, we lack a clear understanding of biological processes that occur in surface and basal ice at glacier termini.

## Multikingdom interactions govern the microbiome in subterranean cultural heritage sites.
 28.03.2022, _W Liu, X Zhou, T Jin, Y Li, B Wu, D Yu, Z Yu, B Su, R Chen, Y Feng, M Delgado-Baquerizo_


SignificanceThe conservation of historical relics against microbial biodeterioration is critical to preserving cultural heritages. One major challenge is our limited understanding of microorganisms' dispersal, colonization, and persistence on relics after excavation and opening to external environments. Here, we investigate the ecological and physiological profiles of the microbiome within and outside the Dahuting Han Dynasty Tomb with a 1,800-y history. Actinobacteria dominate the microbiome in this tomb. Via interkingdom signaling mutualism, springtails carry Actinobacteria as one possible source into the tomb from surrounding environments. Subsequently, Actinobacteria produce cellulases combined with antimicrobial substances, which helps them to colonize and thrive in the tomb via intrakingdom competition. Our findings unravel the ecology of the microbiomes colonizing historical relics and provide help for conservation practices.

## Indoor green can modify the indoor dust microbial communities.

Little is known about the potential role of indoor plants in shaping the indoor microbiota. Within the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort, we collected settled dust and performed 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing and qPCR measurements to characterize the indoor microbiota, including bacterial and fungal loads and Chao1 richness, Shannon, and Simpson diversity indices. For 155 households, we obtained information on the number of indoor plants. We performed linear regression models adjusted for several a priori chosen covariables. Overall, an increase in indoor plants and density was associated with increased microbial diversity, but not load. For example, we found an increase of 64 (95%CI:3;125) and 26 (95%CI:4;48) units of bacterial and fungal taxa richness, respectively, in households with more than three plants compared to no plants. Our results support the hypothesis that indoor plants can enrich indoor microbial diversity, while impacts on microbial loads are not obvious.

## Metagenomic strain detection with SameStr: identification of a persisting core gut microbiota transferable by fecal transplantation.
 29.03.2022, _D Podlesny, C Arze, E Dörner, S Verma, S Dutta, J Walter, WF Fricke_


The understanding of how microbiomes assemble, function, and evolve requires metagenomic tools that can resolve microbiota compositions at the strain level. However, the identification and tracking of microbial strains in fecal metagenomes is challenging and available tools variably classify subspecies lineages, which affects their applicability to infer microbial persistence and transfer.
