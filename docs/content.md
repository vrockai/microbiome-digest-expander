Pregnancy and infancy are vulnerable times for detrimental environmental exposures. However, the exposure situation of microplastics (MPs) for mother-infant pairs and the adverse health effect of MPs are largely unknown. Therefore, we explored MP exposure in placentas and meconium samples, and the potential correlation of MP exposure with microbiota in placentas and meconium. A total of 18 mother-infant pairs were effectively recruited from Shanghai, China. The study required pregnant women to provide placentas and meconium samples. An Agilent 8700 laser infrared imaging spectrometer (LDIR) was applied to identify MPs. Microbiota detection was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. Sixteen types of MPs were found in all matrices, and polyamide (PA) and polyurethane (PU) were the major types we identified. MPs detected in samples with a size of 20-50 μm were more than 76.46%. At the phylum level, both placenta and meconium microbiota were mainly composed of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes. We also found some significant differences between placenta and meconium microbiota in β-diversity and gut composition. Additionally, we found polystyrene was inversely related with the Chao index of meconium microbiota. Polyethylene was consistently inversely correlated with several genera of placenta microbiota. The total MPs, PA, and PU consistently impacted several genera of meconium microbiota. In conclusion, MPs are ubiquitous in placentas and meconium samples, indicating the wide exposure of pregnant women and infants. Moreover, our findings may support a link between high concentration of MPs and microbiota genera in placentas and meconium. Additionally, there were several significant associations between the particle size of MPs in 50-100 μm and meconium microbiota.

Many animals live in intimate associations with a species-rich microbiome. A key factor in maintaining these beneficial associations is fidelity, defined as the stability of associations between hosts and their microbiota over multiple host generations. Fidelity has been well studied in terrestrial hosts, particularly insects, over longer macroevolutionary time. In contrast, little is known about fidelity in marine animals with species-rich microbiomes at short microevolutionary time scales, that is at the level of a single host population. Given that natural selection acts most directly on local populations, studies of microevolutionary partner fidelity are important for revealing the ecological and evolutionary processes that drive intimate beneficial associations within animal species.

Heat stress is an important issue in dairy cattle feeding management affecting summer health and economic efficiency. This experiment combined 16S rDNA sequencing(3,864,982 tags, 30 sequencing data), metagenomic sequencing(1,269,441,128 reads, 18 sequencing data), metabolomics analysis(72 sequencing data) and blood index analysis. Ten cows in each animal type (growing heifers, heifers, and lactating cows) were selected for sample collection in April and August. Here, we characterized both the changes in metabolites, rumen microbial communities and their functional potential and the effects of heat stress on serum biochemical, immune, oxidative stress, and hormonal indices derived from rumen fluid and serum samples from cows during different growth stages and in different climates. The generated data expand the resources for the rumen microbiome related to heat stress and age and provide useful datasets for research on developing therapeutic strategies to achieve high summer milk production in cows. These datasets will help researchers study the effects of heat stress on the physiological metabolism of Holstein cows and the time-dependent changes associated with growth stages.

## Screening Salamanders for Symbionts.
 25.10.2022, _E Vickers, R Kerney_


_Animals, Urodela, Bacteria, Symbiosis_
Microbial symbionts are broadly categorized by their impacts on host fitness: commensals, pathogens, and mutualists. However, recent investigations into the physiological basis of these impacts have revealed nuanced microbial influences on a wide range of host developmental, immunological, and physiological processes, including regeneration. Exploring these impacts begins with knowing which microbes are present. This methodological pipeline contains both targeted assays using PCR and culturing, as well as culture-independent approaches, to survey host salamander tissues for common and unknown microbial symbionts.

The metabolic cold-climate adaption hypothesis predicts that animals from cold environments have relatively high metabolic rates compared with their warm-climate counterparts. However, studies testing this hypothesis are sparse. Here, we compared gut microbes between two cold-climate lizard species of the genus Phrynocephalus to see if gut microbiota could help lizards adapt to cold environments by promoting metabolism. We conducted a 2 species (P. erythrurus and P. przewalskii) × 2 temperatures (24 and 30 °C) factorial design experiment, whereby we kept lizards of two Phrynocephalus species at 24 and 30 °C for 25 d and then collected their fecal samples to analyze and compare the microbiota based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology.

## Genome Evolution of a Symbiont Population for Pathogen Defence in Honeybees.
 20.10.2022, _K Dyrhage, A Garcia-Montaner, D Tamarit, C Seeger, K Näslund, TC Olofsson, A Vasquez, MT Webster, SGE Andersson_


The honeybee gut microbiome is thought to be important for bee health, but the role of the individual members is poorly understood. Here, we present closed genomes and associated mobilomes of 102 Apilactobacillus kunkeei isolates obtained from the honey crop (foregut) of honeybees sampled from beehives in Helsingborg in the south of Sweden and from the islands Gotland and Åland in the Baltic Sea. Each beehive contained a unique composition of isolates and repeated sampling of similar isolates from two beehives in Helsingborg suggests that the bacterial community is stably maintained across bee generations during the summer months. The sampled bacterial population contained an open pan-genome structure with a high genomic density of transposons. A subset of strains affiliated with phylogroup A inhibited growth of the bee pathogen Melissococcus plutonius, all of which contained a 19.5 kb plasmid for the synthesis of the antimicrobial compound kunkecin A, while a subset of phylogroups B and C strains contained a 32.9 kb plasmid for the synthesis of a putative polyketide antibiotic. This study suggests that the mobile gene pool of A. kunkeei plays a key role in pathogen defence in honeybees, providing new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of defensive symbiont populations.

## Diverse MarR bacterial regulators of auxin catabolism in the plant microbiome.

Chemical signalling in the plant microbiome can have drastic effects on microbial community structure, and on host growth and development. Previously, we demonstrated that the auxin metabolic signal interference performed by the bacterial genus Variovorax via an auxin degradation locus was essential for maintaining stereotypic root development in an ecologically relevant bacterial synthetic community. Here, we dissect the Variovorax auxin degradation locus to define the genes iadDE as necessary and sufficient for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) degradation and signal interference. We determine the crystal structures and binding properties of the operon's MarR-family repressor with IAA and other auxins. Auxin degradation operons were identified across the bacterial tree of life and we define two distinct types on the basis of gene content and metabolic products: iac-like and iad-like. The structures of MarRs from representatives of each auxin degradation operon type establish that each has distinct IAA-binding pockets. Comparison of representative IAA-degrading strains from diverse bacterial genera colonizing Arabidopsis plants show that while all degrade IAA, only strains containing iad-like auxin-degrading operons interfere with auxin signalling in a complex synthetic community context. This suggests that iad-like operon-containing bacterial strains, including Variovorax species, play a key ecological role in modulating auxins in the plant microbiome.

## Linking plant functional genes to rhizosphere microbes: a review.
 22.10.2022, _Q Liu, L Cheng, H Nian, J Jin, T Lian_


The importance of rhizomicrobiome in plant development, nutrition acquisition and stress tolerance is unquestionable. Relevant plant genes corresponding to the above functions also regulate rhizomicrobiome construction. Deciphering the molecular regulatory network of plant-microbe interactions could substantially contribute to improving crop yield and quality. Here, the plant genes related nutrient uptake, biotic and abiotic stresses resistance, which may influence the composition and function of microbial communities, are discussed in this review. In turn, the influence of microbes on the expression of functional plant genes, and thereby plant growth and immunity, are also reviewed. Moreover, we have specifically paid attention to techniques and methods used to link plant functional genes and rhizomicrobiome. Finally, we propose to further explore the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of microbe-host gene interactions, which could potentially be used for managing plant health in agricultural systems.

## Resampling-based inferences for compositional regression with application to beef cattle microbiomes.
 21.10.2022, _S Lee, S Jung, J Lourenco, D Pringle, J Ahn_


Gut microbiomes are increasingly found to be associated with many health-related characteristics of humans as well as animals. Regression with compositional microbiomes covariates is commonly used to identify important bacterial taxa that are related to various phenotype responses. Often the dimension of microbiome taxa easily exceeds the number of available samples, which creates a serious challenge in the estimation and inference of the model. The sparse log-contrast regression method is useful for such cases as it can yield a model estimate that depends on only a small number of taxa. However, a formal statistical inference procedure for individual regression coefficients has not been properly established yet. We propose a new estimation and inference procedure for linear regression models with extremely low-sample-sized compositional predictors. Under the compositional log-contrast regression framework, the proposed approach consists of two steps. The first step is to screen relevant predictors by fitting a log-contrast model with a sparse penalty. The screened-in variables are used as predictors in the non-sparse log-contrast model in the second step, where each of the regression coefficients is tested using nonparametric, resampling-based methods such as permutation and bootstrap. The performances of the proposed methods are evaluated by a simulation study, which shows they outperform traditional approaches based on normal assumptions or large sample asymptotics. Application to steer microbiome data successfully identifies key bacterial taxa that are related to important cattle quality measures.
