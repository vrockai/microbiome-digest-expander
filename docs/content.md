Gastrointestinal symptoms are more prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in typically developing (TD) children. Constipation is a significant gastrointestinal comorbidity of ASD, but the associations among constipated autism spectrum disorder (C-ASD), microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are still debated. We enrolled 80 children, divided into the C-ASD group (n = 40) and the TD group (n = 40). In this study, an integrated 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was applied to explore the association of the gut microbiota and SCFAs in C-ASD children in China. The community diversity estimated by the Observe, Chao1, and ACE indices was significantly lower in the C-ASD group than in the TD group. We observed that Ruminococcaceae_UCG_002, Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG_003, Phascolarctobacterium, Megamonas, Ruminiclostridium_5, Parabacteroides, Prevotella_2, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella_9 were enriched in the C-ASD group, and Anaerostipes, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus_gnavus_group, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Ralstonia, Eubacterium_eligens_group, and Ruminococcus_1 were enriched in the TD group. The propionate levels, which were higher in the C-ASD group, were negatively correlated with the abundance of Lactobacillus taxa, but were positively correlated with the severity of ASD symptoms. The random forest model, based on the 16 representative discriminant genera, achieved a high accuracy (AUC = 0.924). In conclusion, we found that C-ASD is related to altered gut microbiota and SCFAs, especially decreased abundance of Lactobacillus and excessive propionate in faeces, which provide new clues to understand C-ASD and biomarkers for the diagnosis and potential strategies for treatment of the disorder. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( www.chictr.org.cn ; trial registration number ChiCTR2100052106; date of registration: October 17, 2021).

## Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium tyrobutyricum: angel or devil for necrotizing enterocolitis?
 03.11.2023, _R Tao, G Zong, Y Pan, H Li, P Cheng, R Deng, W Chen, A Wang, S Xia, W Tang, Y Lu, Z Wei_


Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a challenging gastrointestinal disease that disproportionately affects premature neonates, with high incidence and case-fatality rates. Despite extensive research efforts, the pathogenesis and mechanisms of NEC remain unclear, making it difficult to effectively eradicate. However, it has been established that dysbiosis of gut microbes occurs before the onset of NEC, providing compelling evidence for the potential use of probiotic therapy. As such, we have focused our attention on two probiotics in particular: Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium tyrobutyricum, especially in light of recent breakthroughs that have linked several Clostridia species with NEC. To determine whether C. butyricum and C. tyrobutyricum are pathogenic or probiotic, we conducted a comparison of the phenotypic traits of NEC mice treated with each bacterium. Our results confirm that treatment with C. tyrobutyricum restores intestinal barrier integrity and alleviates inflammatory immune responses associated with NEC. In contrast, treatment with C. butyricum exacerbates intestinal barrier damage and promotes immune disorder, including increased numbers of macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils in the intestinal lamina propria. Further analysis of the gut microbiome suggests that the positive effects of C. tyrobutyricum treatment are associated with an increase in Akkermansia muciniphila, while C. butyricum treatment decreases the level of A. muciniphila, which accounts for its negative effect on NEC. This study sheds light on the fact that treatment with C. tyrobutyricum, but not C. butyricum, has the potential to protect against NEC development. The opposite effects of these two probiotics on NEC may result from their different modulation of the level of A. muciniphila, a gut microbe that is closely associated with intestinal homeostasis. In summary, by improving the abundance of A. muciniphila to alleviate intestinal inflammation and enhance intestinal barrier integrity, supplementation with C. tyrobutyricum may become a promising therapy for NEC.IMPORTANCEThis study sheds light on that treatment with Clostridium tyrobutyricum but not Clostridium butyricum is entitled to protect against necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) development potentially. The mechanisms behind the opposite effect on NEC may result in different modulation on the level of Akkermansia muciniphila, which is deeply associated with intestinal homoeostasis. Briefly, through improving the abundance of A. muciniphila to alleviate intestinal inflammation and enhance intestinal barrier integrity, C. tyrobutyricum supplement may become a promising therapy for NEC.

Tuberculosis (TB) preventive therapy (TPT) is an effective strategy to eliminate TB in low-incidence settings. Shorter TPT regimens incorporating the antimicrobial class of rifamycins are designed to improve adherence and completion rates but carry the risk of modifications to the gut microbiota. We enrolled six subjects diagnosed with latent TB infection (LTBI) who accepted to initiate TPT. We also enrolled six healthy volunteers unexposed to the rifamycins. We profiled the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing (V1-V2 region) to document the immediate effect of rifamycin-based TPT on the gut microbiota composition and tracked recovery to baseline two months after TPT. Overall, TPT accounted for 17% of the variance in gut microbial community dissimilarity. This rifamycin-based TPT induced dysbiosis was characterized by a depletion of butyrate-producing taxa (Clostridium-XIVa and Roseburia) and expansion of potentially pathogenic taxa within the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla. Recovery of the gut microbial composition was incomplete two months after TPT. Robust clinical studies are necessary to comprehensively catalogue TPT-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis to inform strategies to mitigate potential long-term sequelae of this important TB control intervention.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have provided numerous associations between human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and health traits. Likewise, metagenome-wide association studies (MWASs) between bacterial SNPs and human traits can suggest mechanistic links, but very few such studies have been done thus far. In this study, we devised an MWAS framework to detect SNPs and associate them with host phenotypes systematically. We recruited and obtained gut metagenomic samples from a cohort of 7,190 healthy individuals and discovered 1,358 statistically significant associations between a bacterial SNP and host body mass index (BMI), from which we distilled 40 independent associations. Most of these associations were unexplained by diet, medications or physical exercise, and 17 replicated in a geographically independent cohort. We uncovered BMI-associated SNPs in 27 bacterial species, and 12 of them showed no association by standard relative abundance analysis. We revealed a BMI association of an SNP in a potentially inflammatory pathway of Bilophila wadsworthia as well as of a group of SNPs in a region coding for energy metabolism functions in a Faecalibacterium prausnitzii genome. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering nucleotide-level diversity in microbiome studies and pave the way toward improved understanding of interpersonal microbiome differences and their potential health implications.

The gut microbiota is believed to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of IBS, and its metabolic byproducts, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are known to influence gut function and host health. Despite this, the precise role of SCFAs in IBS remains a topic of debate. In this study, we examined the bacterial community structure by 16S rRNA gene profiling and SCFA levels by UPLC-MS/MS in fecal samples from healthy controls (HC; n = 100) and non-constipated patients (IBS-D and IBS-M; NC-IBS; n = 240) enrolled in 19 hospitals in Italy. Our findings suggest a significant difference between the fecal microbiomes of NC-IBS patients and HC subjects, with HC exhibiting higher intra-sample biodiversity. Furthermore, we were able to classify non-constipated patients into two distinct subgroups based on their fecal SCFA levels (fecal catabotype "high" and "low"), each characterized by unique taxonomic bacterial signatures. Our results suggest that the fecal catabotype with higher SCFA levels may represent a distinct clinical phenotype of IBS that could have implications for its diagnosis and treatment. This study provides a new perspective on the intricate relationship between the gut microbiome and bowel symptoms in IBS, underscoring the importance of personalized strategies for its management.

## Characterizing alterations in the gut microbiota following postpartum weight change.
 31.10.2023, _BN Chalifour, DI Trifonova, EA Holzhausen, MJ Bailey, KA Schmidt, M Babaei, P Mokhtari, MI Goran, TL Alderete_


The postpartum period represents a dynamic time for women's health, particularly when it comes to changes in weight, which can disproportionately affect Latina women. Weight change, particularly weight gain, has been associated with pronounced changes in host gut microbiome profiles and composition. This study aimed to evaluate changes in the gut microbiome among Latina mothers who gained or lost weight in the first 6 months after delivery by characterizing changes in gut microbial co-occurrence networks, alpha- and beta-diversity measures, and relative abundances of bacterial taxa. This study characterized the gut microbiomes of 105 Latina mothers at 1 and 6 months postpartum, comparing mothers who gained weight (n = 65) with those who lost weight (n = 40) during the 6-month period following delivery. Stool samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Statistical analysis was conducted using microbial co-occurrence network analysis as well as paired two-sided t-tests. Mothers who gained weight postpartum had significant changes in their co-occurrence network density, alpha- and beta-diversity, and relative abundances of certain microbial taxa compared to those who lost weight. Microbial co-occurrence networks, representing measures of differences in community structure dynamics, of the weight gain group decreased in density by 2%, while there was no change in density in the weight loss group. Additionally, the weight gain group had lower Shannon entropy after 6 months and significant changes in the relative abundances of 17 bacterial families and genera, while there were no significant changes in any of these metrics in the weight loss group.IMPORTANCEPrevious research has reported differences in the gut microbiome associated with varying body compositions. More specifically, within populations of mothers, the focus has been on the impact of gestational weight gain. This is the first study to examine postpartum weight change and its association with changes in the gut microbiome, similarly, it is the first to use a Latina cohort to do so. The results support the idea that weight gain may be an important factor in reducing gut microbiome network connectivity, diversity, and changing abundances of specific microbial taxa, all measures thought to impact host health. These results suggest that weight gain dynamically alters mothers' gut microbial communities in the first 6 months postpartum, with comparatively little change in mothers who lost weight; further research is needed to examine the health consequences of such changes.

The antidiabetic drug pioglitazone ameliorates insulin resistance by activating the transcription factor PPARÎ³. In addition to its blood glucose-lowering action, pioglitazone exerts pleiotropic effects including amelioration of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The mechanism by which pioglitazone achieves this latter effect has remained unclear, however. We here show that pioglitazone administration increases the amount of linoleic acid (LA) metabolites in adipose tissue of KK-Ay mice. These metabolites are produced by lactic acid bacteria in the gut, and pioglitazone also increased the fraction of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota. Administration of the LA metabolite HYA (10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid) to C57BL/6 J mice fed a high-fat diet improved liver histology including steatosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and fibrosis. Gene ontology analysis of RNA-sequencing data for the liver revealed that the top category for genes downregulated by HYA treatment was related to extracellular matrix, and the expression of individual genes related to fibrosis was confirmed to be attenuated by HYA treatment. Mechanistically, HYA suppressed TGF-Î²-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and fibrosis-related gene expression in human hepatic stellate cells (LX-2). Our results implicate LA metabolites in the mechanism by which pioglitazone ameliorates liver fibrosis, and they suggest that HYA is a potential therapeutic for NAFLD/NASH.

_Humans, Fecal Microbiota Transplantation, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Drug Resistance, Bacterial, Feces, Treatment Outcome_
Multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization is a fundamental challenge in antimicrobial resistance. Limited studies have shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can reduce MDRO colonization, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of FMT for MDRO decolonization in renal transplant recipients called PREMIX (NCT02922816). Eleven participants were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to FMT or an observation period followed by delayed FMT if stool cultures were MDRO positive at day 36. Participants who were MDRO positive after one FMT were treated with a second FMT. At last visit, eight of nine patients who completed all treatments were MDRO culture negative. FMT-treated participants had longer time to recurrent MDRO infection versus PREMIX-eligible controls who were not treated with FMT. Key taxa (Akkermansia muciniphila, Alistipes putredinis, Phocaeicola dorei, Phascolarctobacterium faecium, Alistipes species, Mesosutterella massiliensis, Barnesiella intestinihominis, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) from the single feces donor used in the study that engrafted in recipients and metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids and bile acids in FMT-responding participants uncovered leads for rational microbiome therapeutic and diagnostic development. Metagenomic analyses revealed a previously unobserved mechanism of MDRO eradication by conspecific strain competition in an FMT-treated subset. Susceptible Enterobacterales strains that replaced baseline extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase-producing strains were not detectable in donor microbiota manufactured as FMT doses but in one case were detectable in the recipient before FMT. These data suggest that FMT may provide a path to exploit strain competition to reduce MDRO colonization.

Minimizing mortality losses due to multiple stress and obtaining maximum performance are the production goals for newly received cattle. In recent years, vaccination and metaphylaxis treatment significantly decreased the mortality rate of newly received cattle, while the growth block induced by treatment is still obvious. Assessment of blood metabolites and behavior monitoring offer potential for early identification of morbid animals. Moreover, the ruminal microorganisms' homeostasis is a guarantee of beef steers' growth and health. The most critical period for newly received cattle is the first-month post-transport. Therefore, analyzing rumen metagenomics, rumen metabolomics, host metabolomics, and their interaction during receiving period (1 day before transport and at days 1/4, 16, and 30 after transport) is key to revealing the mechanism of growth retardation, and then to formulating management and nutritional practices for newly received cattle.

## Shifts in the coral microbiome in response to in situ experimental deoxygenation.
 02.11.2023, _RD Howard, MD Schul, LM Rodriguez Bravo, AH Altieri, JL Meyer_


Global climate change impacts marine ecosystems through rising surface temperatures, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation. While the response of the coral holobiont to the first two effects has been relatively well studied, less is known about the response of the coral microbiome to deoxygenation. In this study, we investigated the response of the microbiome to hypoxia in two coral species that differ in their tolerance to hypoxia. We conducted in situ oxygen manipulations on a coral reef in BahÃ­a Almirante on the Caribbean coast of Panama, which has previously experienced documented episodes of hypoxia. NaÃ¯ve coral colonies (previously unexposed to hypoxia) of Siderastrea siderea and Agaricia lamarcki were transplanted to a reef and either enclosed in chambers that created hypoxic conditions or left at ambient oxygen levels. We collected samples of surface mucus and tissue after 48 hours of exposure and characterized the microbiome by sequencing 16S rRNA genes. We found that the microbiomes of the two coral species were distinct from one another and remained so after exhibiting similar shifts in microbiome composition in response to hypoxia. There was an increase in both abundance and number of taxa of anaerobic microbes after exposure to hypoxia. Some of these taxa may play beneficial roles in the coral holobiont by detoxifying the surrounding environment during hypoxic stress or may represent opportunists exploiting host stress. This work describes the first characterization of the coral microbiome under hypoxia and is an initial step toward identifying potential beneficial bacteria for corals facing this environmental stressor.IMPORTANCEMarine hypoxia is a threat for corals but has remained understudied in tropical regions where coral reefs are abundant. Though microbial symbioses can alleviate the effects of ecological stress, we do not yet understand the taxonomic or functional response of the coral microbiome to hypoxia. In this study, we experimentally lowered oxygen levels around Siderastrea siderea and Agaricia lamarcki colonies in situ to observe changes in the coral microbiome in response to deoxygenation. Our results show that hypoxia triggers a stochastic change of the microbiome overall, with some bacterial families changing deterministically after just 48 hours of exposure. These families represent an increase in anaerobic and opportunistic taxa in the microbiomes of both coral species. Thus, marine deoxygenation destabilizes the coral microbiome and increases bacterial opportunism. This work provides novel and fundamental knowledge of the microbial response in coral during hypoxia and may provide insight into holobiont function during stress.

## Limitation of amino acid availability by bacterial populations during enhanced colitis in IBD mouse model.

Members of the Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus are associated with persistent gut inflammation due to rapid colonization combined with pathogenic tendencies. Here, we investigated the functions of gut microbial populations resulting in persistent gut inflammation. In this study, we utilized the IL-10 knockout mouse model and induced colitis using dextran sulfate sodium (2%) after development. Dams during gestation were provided cefoperazone to induce vertically transmitted dysbiosis in the pups that were monitored in this study. We characterized the dysbiotic gut microbial community and potential crosstalk of these microbes, and host gene expression changes to identify bacterial populations and potential functions that were involved in gut inflammation. We isolated Enterobacteriaceae populations from mice to validate the utilization of sulfur-containing amino acids. Members of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus were highly detected in inflamed mice. Enterobacteriaceae populations containing L-cysteine dioxygenase were strongly correlated with the upregulation of host gene CSAD, responsible for cysteine breakdown. We observed that bacterial isolates from dysbiotic mice displayed increased growth rates when supplemented with L-cysteine, highlighting the use of sulfur metabolism. Our results show that microbial populations use alternate metabolisms and sequester host nutrients for growth, associated with inflammation in the gut.IMPORTANCEInflammatory bowel disease is associated with an increase in Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus species; however, the specific mechanisms are unclear. Previous research has reported the associations between microbiota and inflammation, here we investigate potential pathways that specific bacteria populations use to drive gut inflammation. Richie et al. show that these bacterial populations utilize an alternate sulfur metabolism and are tolerant of host-derived immune-response products. These metabolic pathways drive host gut inflammation and fuel over colonization of these pathobionts in the dysbiotic colon. Cultured isolates from dysbiotic mice indicated faster growth supplemented with L-cysteine, showing these microbes can utilize essential host nutrients.

## Estradiol mediates colonic epithelial protection in aged mice after stroke and is associated with shifts in the gut microbiome.

_Mice, Female, Male, Animals, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Intestinal Mucosa, Estradiol, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Mucins, Brain Injuries_
The gut is a major source of bacteria and antigens that contribute to neuroinflammation after brain injury. Colonic epithelial cells (ECs) are responsible for secreting major cellular components of the innate defense system, including antimicrobial proteins (AMP) and mucins. These cells serve as a critical regulator of gut barrier function and maintain host-microbe homeostasis. In this study, we determined post-stroke host defense responses at the colonic epithelial surface in mice. We then tested if the enhancement of these epithelial protective mechanisms is beneficial in young and aged mice after stroke. AMPs were significantly increased in the colonic ECs of young males, but not in young females after experimental stroke. In contrast, mucin-related genes were enhanced in young females and contributed to mucus formation that maintains the distance between the host and gut bacteria. Bacterial community profiling was done using universal amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequences. The sex-specific colonic epithelial defense responses after stroke in young females were reversed with ovariectomy and led to a shift from a predominately mucin response to the enhanced AMP expression seen in males after stroke. Estradiol (E2) replacement prior to stroke in aged females increased mucin gene expression in the colonic ECs. Interestingly, we found that E2 treatment reduced stroke-associated neuronal hyperactivity in the insular cortex, a brain region that interacts with visceral organs such as the gut, in parallel to an increase in the composition of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the gut microbiota. This is the first study demonstrating sex differences in host defense mechanisms in the gut after brain injury.

## Functional potential and evolutionary response to long-term heat selection of bacterial associates of coral photosymbionts.
 01.11.2023, _J Maire, GK Philip, J Livingston, LM Judd, LL Blackall, MJH van Oppen_


Corals rely on a wide range of microorganisms for their functioning, including intracellular dinoflagellates (Symbiodiniaceae) and bacteria. Marine heatwaves trigger the loss of Symbiodiniaceae from coral tissues-coral bleaching-often leading to death. While coral-bacteria interactions are widely studied, Symbiodiniaceae-bacteria interactions have remained largely uninvestigated. Here, we provide a genomic analysis of 49 bacteria, spanning 16 genera, that are closely associated with six cultured Symbiodiniaceae species. We analyzed bacterial functional potential by focusing on potentially beneficial functions for the Symbiodiniaceae host, including B vitamin synthesis and antioxidant abilities, which may be crucial for Symbiodiniaceae heat tolerance and, in turn, coral resistance to thermal bleaching. These analyses suggest a wide potential for B vitamin synthesis and the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (through the production of carotenoids or antioxidant enzymes), and possibly the transfer of organic carbon to host cells. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis between bacteria isolated from wild-type and heat-evolved Symbiodiniaceae cultures revealed that exposure to long-term elevated temperature has resulted in mutations in genes known to be involved in host-symbiont interactions, such as secretion systems. Climate change may therefore modify how Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria interact. This study provides an overview of the possible roles of Symbiodiniaceae-associated bacteria in Symbiodiniaceae functioning and heat tolerance, reinforcing the need for further studies of such interactions to fully understand coral biology and climate resilience. IMPORTANCE Symbiotic microorganisms are crucial for the survival of corals and their resistance to coral bleaching in the face of climate change. However, the impact of microbe-microbe interactions on coral functioning is mostly unknown but could be essential factors for coral adaption to future climates. Here, we investigated interactions between cultured dinoflagellates of the Symbiodiniaceae family, essential photosymbionts of corals, and associated bacteria. By assessing the genomic potential of 49 bacteria, we found that they are likely beneficial for Symbiodiniaceae, through the production of B vitamins and antioxidants. Additionally, bacterial genes involved in host-symbiont interactions, such as secretion systems, accumulated mutations following long-term exposure to heat, suggesting symbiotic interactions may change under climate change. This highlights the importance of microbe-microbe interactions in coral functioning.
