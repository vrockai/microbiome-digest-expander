 20.09.2022, _M Zhang, L Shen, X Zhou, H Chen_


An in-depth understanding of the lung microbiota in tuberculosis (TB) infection could provide optimal strategies for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Only a few studies have investigated the impact of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and anti-TB treatment on the lung microbiota. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood samples were collected from 23 active TB patients (TBZ), 17 latent tuberculosis infection patients (LTBI), 13 healthy controls (HC), and 14 active TB patients with 1-month anti-TB therapy (TBM) for 16S RNA sequencing and serological indexes, respectively. Low body mass index, albumin, and total triglyceride levels were detected in TBZ. Pulmonary Mtb infection led to a minor decrease in the alpha diversity of the lung microbiota in TBZ than HC, but a significant difference was noted in beta diversity. Subsequently, anti-TB therapy caused a rapid alteration in the lung community structure due to reduced alpha and beta diversity. Proteobacteria were abundant in TBZ samples, while Firmicutes was predominant in the LITB and HC samples. Lactobacillus and Subdoligranulum (genera) were the most unique in the LTBI and HC group, respectively. The TBM group showed the most predominant abundance of Bacteroides, Oscillospira, and Ruminococcus (genera). Functional pathways, such as indole alkaloid biosynthesis, Wnt signaling pathway, endocytosis, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, significantly decreased in the TBM group compared with TBZ group. Pulmonary TB and anti-TB treatment caused a distinct dysbiosis of the lung microbiome. The current findings suggested potential links between the lung microbiota and TB onset, progression, and treatment.

Comorbid anxiety and depression are common and are associated with greater disease burden than either alone. Our recent efforts have identified an association between gut microbiota dysfunction and severity of anxiety and depression. In this follow-up, we applied Differential Co-Expression Analysis (DiffCoEx) to identify potential gut microbiota biomarker(s) candidates of treatment resistance among psychiatric inpatients.

## Modulatory role of gut microbiota in cholesterol and glucose metabolism: Potential implications for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease Atherosclerosis.
 20.09.2022, _J Roessler, DM Leistner, U Landmesser, A Haghikia_


Accumulating evidence suggests an important role of gut microbiota in physiological processes of host metabolism as well as cardiometabolic disease. Recent advances in metagenomic and metabolomic research have led to discoveries of novel pathways in which intestinal microbial metabolism of dietary nutrients is linked to metabolic profiles and cardiovascular disease risk. A number of metaorganismal circuits have been identified by microbiota transplantation studies and experimental models using germ-free rodents. Many of these pathways involve gut microbiota-related bioactive metabolites that impact host metabolism, in particular lipid and glucose homeostasis, partly via specific host receptors. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of how the gut microbiome can impact cardiometabolic phenotypes and provide an overview of recent advances of gut microbiome research. Finally, the potential of modulating intestinal microbiota composition and/or targeting microbiota-related pathways for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies in cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases will be discussed.

_Adult, Archaea, Bacteria, Diet, Ethnicity, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Geography, Humans, Urbanization_
The human gut is home to a largely underexplored microbiome component, the archaeome. Little is known of the impact of geography, urbanization, ethnicity, and diet on the gut archaeome in association with host health. We aim to delineate the variation of the human gut archaeome in healthy individuals and its association with environmental factors and host homeostasis.

## Community and shotgun metagenomic analysis of Alligator mississippiensis oral cavity and GI tracts reveal complex ecosystems and potential reservoirs of antibiotic resistance.
 17.09.2022, _J Perez-Marron, C Sanders, E Gomez, S Escopete, T Owerkowicz, PM Orwin_


We report here the community structure and functional analysis of the microbiome of the Alligator mississippiensis GI tract from the oral cavity through the entirety of the digestive tract. Although many vertebrate microbiomes have been studied in recent years, the archosaur microbiome has only been given cursory attention. In the oral cavity we used amplicon-based community analysis to examine the structure of the oral microbiome during alligator development. We found a community that diversified over time and showed many of the hallmarks we would expect of a stable oral community. This is a bit surprising given the rapid turnover of alligator teeth but suggests that the stable gumline microbes are able to rapidly colonize the emerging teeth. As we move down the digestive tract, we were able to use both long and short read sequencing approaches to evaluate the community using a shotgun metagenomics approach. Long read sequencing was applied to samples from the stomach/duodenum, and the colorectal region, revealing a fairly uniform and low complexity community made up primarily of proteobacteria at the top of the gut and much more diversity in the colon. We used deep short read sequencing to further interrogate this colorectal community. The two sequencing approaches were concordant with respect to community structure but substantially more detail was available in the short read data, in spite of high levels of host DNA contamination. Using both approaches we were able to show that the colorectal community is a potential reservoir for antibiotic resistance, human pathogens such as Clostridiodes difficile and a possible source of novel antimicrobials or other useful secondary metabolites.

## Mitigating abiotic stress: microbiome engineering for improving agricultural production and environmental sustainability.
 20.09.2022, _M Phour, SS Sindhu_


The responses of plants to different abiotic stresses and mechanisms involved in their mitigation are discussed. Production of osmoprotectants, antioxidants, enzymes and other metabolites by beneficial microorganisms and their bioengineering ameliorates environmental stresses to improve food production. Progressive intensification of global agriculture, injudicious use of agrochemicals and change in climate conditions have deteriorated soil health, diminished the microbial biodiversity and resulted in environment pollution along with increase in biotic and abiotic stresses. Extreme weather conditions and erratic rains have further imposed additional stress for the growth and development of plants. Dominant abiotic stresses comprise drought, temperature, increased salinity, acidity, metal toxicity and nutrient starvation in soil, which severely limit crop production. For promoting sustainable crop production in environmentally challenging environments, use of beneficial microbes has emerged as a safer and sustainable means for mitigation of abiotic stresses resulting in improved crop productivity. These stress-tolerant microorganisms play an effective role against abiotic stresses by enhancing the antioxidant potential, improving nutrient acquisition, regulating the production of plant hormones, ACC deaminase, siderophore and exopolysaccharides and accumulating osmoprotectants and, thus, stimulating plant biomass and crop yield. In addition, bioengineering of beneficial microorganisms provides an innovative approach to enhance stress tolerance in plants. The use of genetically engineered stress-tolerant microbes as inoculants of crop plants may facilitate their use for enhanced nutrient cycling along with amelioration of abiotic stresses to improve food production for the ever-increasing population. In this chapter, an overview is provided about the current understanding of plant-bacterial interactions that help in alleviating abiotic stress in different crop systems in the face of climate change. This review largely focuses on the importance and need of sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches using beneficial microbes for ameliorating the environmental stresses in our agricultural systems.
