 11.07.2022, _GF Hatfull_


_Bacteriophages, Genome, Viral, Humans, Mycobacteriophages, Mycobacterium, Mycobacterium Infections, Mycobacterium smegmatis_
Mycobacteriophages-bacteriophages infecting Mycobacterium hosts-contribute substantially to our understanding of viral diversity and evolution, provide resources for advancing Mycobacterium genetics, are the basis of high-impact science education programs, and show considerable therapeutic potential. Over 10,000 individual mycobacteriophages have been isolated by high school and undergraduate students using the model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 and 2,100 have been completely sequenced, giving a high-resolution view of the phages that infect a single common host strain. The phage genomes are revealed to be highly diverse and architecturally mosaic and are replete with genes of unknown function. Mycobacteriophages have provided many widely used tools for Mycobacterium genetics including integration-proficient vectors and recombineering systems, as well as systems for efficient delivery of reporter genes, transposons, and allelic exchange substrates. The genomic insights and engineering tools have facilitated exploration of phages for treatment of Mycobacterium infections, although their full therapeutic potential has yet to be realized.

## Reconstructing the ecosystem context of a species: Honey-borne DNA reveals the roles of the honeybee.
 14.07.2022, _HK Wirta, M Bahram, K Miller, T Roslin, E Vesterinen_


To assess a species' impact on its environment-and the environment's impact upon a species-we need to pinpoint its links to surrounding taxa. The honeybee (Apis mellifera) provides a promising model system for such an exercise. While pollination is an important ecosystem service, recent studies suggest that honeybees can also provide disservices. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the full suite of services and disservices that honeybees provide is a key priority for such a ubiquitous species. In this perspective paper, we propose that the DNA contents of honey can be used to establish the honeybee's functional niche, as reflected by ecosystem services and disservices. Drawing upon previously published genomic data, we analysed the DNA found within 43 honey samples from Northern Europe. Based on metagenomic analysis, we find that the taxonomic composition of DNA is dominated by a low pathogenicity bee virus with 40.2% of the reads, followed by bacteria (16.7%), plants (9.4%) and only 1.1% from fungi. In terms of ecological roles of taxa associated with the bees or taxa in their environment, bee gut microbes dominate the honey DNA, with plants as the second most abundant group. A range of pathogens associated with plants, bees and other animals occur frequently, but with lower relative read abundance, across the samples. The associations found here reflect a versatile the honeybee's role in the North-European ecosystem. Feeding on nectar and pollen, the honeybee interacts with plants-in particular with cultivated crops. In doing so, the honeybee appears to disperse common pathogens of plants, pollinators and other animals, but also microbes potentially protective of these pathogens. Thus, honey-borne DNA helps us define the honeybee's functional niche, offering directions to expound the benefits and drawbacks of the associations to the honeybee itself and its interacting organisms.

The distribution pattern of the microbial community in mountains is an important component of biodiversity research. Many environmental factors vary significantly with elevation on a relatively small scale in subalpine and alpine environments. These factors may markedly affect microbial community composition and function. In this study, we analyzed phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and phosphorus (P) fractions in soils from 9 sites along an elevation gradient (3500-4100 m above sea level (a.s.l.)) of the Shergyla Mountain, Tibet in China. Many biomarker PLFAs indicated that there were biogeochemical trends of the microbial distribution patterns of some soil microorganisms, which were most often increasing, U-shaped and unimodal trends along the elevation gradient. A redundancy analysis (RDA) and correlations indicated that P factors (e.g., Resin-Pi, NaHCO3-Pi and NaHCO3-Po) were more important in controlling the microbial PLFA distribution pattern than other factors (e.g., MAT, MAP, pH, TOC, TN and soil moisture) in this study area. Microorganisms are strongly associated with P fractions. Our results suggested that microbial communities were subjected to P stresses and that the distribution patterns of microbial communities were shaped by bioavailable P along the elevation gradient. Our work also hints that P geochemical processes drive the microbial diversity of the Shergyla Mountains.

## Community succession and straw degradation characteristics using a microbial decomposer at low temperature.
 12.07.2022, _X Zhang, Q Borjigin, J Gao, X Yu, B Zhang, S Hu, S Han, R Liu, S Zhang_


_Bacteria, Cellulose, Fermentation, Lignin, Microbial Consortia, Temperature_
This study explored changes in the microbial community structure during straw degradation by a microbial decomposer, M44. The microbial community succession at different degradation periods was analyzed using MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that 14 days after inoculation, the filter paper enzyme and endoglucanase activities increased to 2.55 U·mL-1 and 2.34 U·mL-1. The xylanase, laccase, and lignin peroxidase activities rose to 9.86 U·mL-1, 132.16 U·L-1, and 85.43 U·L-1 after 28 d, which was consistent with changes in the straw degradation rate. The degradation rates of straw, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose were 31.43%, 13.67%, 25.04%, and 21.69%, respectively, after 28 d of fermentation at 15°C. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the main bacterial species in samples at different degradation stages. The dominant genera included Pseudomonas, Delftia, and Paenibacillus during the initial stage (1 d, 7 d) and the mid-term stage (14 d). The key functional microbes during the late stage (21 d, 28 d) were Rhizobium, Chryseobacterium, Sphingobacterium, Brevundimonas, and Devosia. Changes in the bacterial consortium structure and straw degradation characteristics during different degradation periods were clarified to provide a theoretical basis for the rational utilization of microbial decomposer M44.

The levels of indoor air microbial load in hospitals are very crucial to the health of patients and health care workers and are to be regularly monitored and maintained at an acceptable level. However, this problem remains overlooked, particularly in developing countries including Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study is designed to determine the indoor air microbial load (settle plate technique), microbial isolates (standard microbiological techniques), bacterial susceptibility profiles (Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique), and associated factors, in different wards of the title Hospital, southern Ethiopia. An observational checklist was used to collect relevant information related to the associated factors; descriptive and inferential statistics were applied using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS); p-values ≤ 0.05 in the multivariable analysis were considered statistically significant. The total average bacterial and fungal load of the selected wards was 1914±1081.4 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/m3 (95% CI: 1718.5-2109.48 CFU/m3) and 1533.7±858.8 CFU/m3 (95% CI: 1378.5-1688CFU/m3) respectively. The highest mean bacterial (1914±1081.4 CFU/m3) and fungal (1533.7±858.8 CFU/m3) loads were found in the male surgical and female medical wards respectively. A total of 229 bacterial and 139 fungal isolates were obtained; Gram-positive bacteria were the predominant type, 130 (56.7%), particularly the isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 46 (20.1%). The predominant fungal isolates were Aspergillus sp., 53(38%). Percentages of multidrug-resistant (MDR), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), and carbapenemase producers respectively were 48.5, 26.5, and 25%. High room crowd index [p = 0.003; Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 12.5 (Confidence Interval (CI) 95%: 2.42-65)], presence of damp/wet materials [p = 0.025; AOR 7 (CI 95%: 1.3-37.4)], intense room traffic [p = 0.004; AOR 9.6 (CI 95%: 1.2-79.3)], inappropriate storage of food and drugs [p = 0.008; AOR 7.5 (CI 95%: 1.7-32)], and unclean environment [p = 0.03; AOR 5.8 (CI 95%: 1.2-28)] showed statistical significance concerning the indoor air microbial loads; most of the wards in Arba Minch General Hospital (AMGH) stand high and not in an acceptable level as per the WHO and the European Commission standards on indoor air microbial load. Periodic air surveillance and infection prevention control programs are required to reduce the transmission of these microbes to inpatients, visitors, and health care workers.

## moreThanANOVA: A user-friendly Shiny/R application for exploring and comparing data with interactive visualization.
 12.07.2022, _W Jiang, H Chen, L Yang, X Pan_


_Normal Distribution, Software_
In the case of comparing means of various groups, data exploration and comparison for affecting factors or relative indices would be involved. This process is not only complex requiring extensive statistical knowledge and methods, but also challenging for the complex installation of existing tools for users who lack of statistical knowledge and coding experience. Like, the normal distribution and equal variance are crucial premises of parametric statistical analysis. But some studies reported that associated data from various industries violated the normal distribution and equal variance, parametric analysis still involved leading to invalid results. This is owing to that the normal distribution tests and homogeneity of variance test for different variables are time-cost and error-prone, posing an urgent need for an automatic and user-friendly analysis application, not only integrating normal distribution tests and homogeneity of variance test, but also associated the following statistical analysis. To address this, we developed a Shiny/R application, moreThanANOVA, which is an interactive, user-friendly, open-source and cloud-based visualization application to achieve automatic distribution tests, and correlative significance tests, then customize post-hoc analysis based on the considerations to the trade-off of Type I and Type II errors (deployed at https://hanchen.shinyapps.io/moreThanANOVA/). moreThanANOVA enables novice users to perform their complex statistical analyses quickly and credibly with interactive visualization and download publication-ready graphs for further analysis.

## Preparation of biological monolayers for producing high-resolution scanning electron micrographs.
 12.07.2022, _S Mentor, F Cummings, D Fisher_


_Animals, Carbon, Electrons, Endothelial Cells, Gold, Mice, Microscopy, Electron, Scanning_
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) provides a technical platform for nanoscopic mapping of biological structures. Correct preparation of SEM samples can provide an unprecedented understanding of the nexus between cellular morphology and topography. This comparative study critically examines two coating methods for preparing biological samples for scanning electron microscopy, while also providing novel advice on how to prepare in vitro epithelial or endothelial samples for high-resolution scanning-electron microscopy (HR-SEM). Two obstacles often confront the biologist when investigating cellular structures grown under tissue culture conditions, namely., how to prepare and present the biological samples to the HR-SEM microscope without affecting topographical membrane and cellular structural alterations. Firstly, our use of the Millicell cellulose inserts on which to grow our cellular samples in preparation for HR-SEM is both novel and advantageous to comparing the permeability function of cells to their morphological function. Secondly, biological material is often non-conducting, thermally sensitive and fragile and, therefore, needs to be fixed correctly and coated with thin conducting metal to ensure high-resolution detail of samples. Immortalized mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd5) was used as a basis for describing the preferences in the use of the protocol. We compare two biological sample coating modalities for the visualizing and analysis of texturized, topographical, membranous ultrastructures of brain endothelial cell (BEC) confluent monolayers, namely, carbon and gold:palladium (Au:Pd) sputter coating in preparation for HR-SEM. BEC monolayers sputter-coated with these two modalities produced three-dimensional micrographs which have distinctly different topographical detail from which the nanostructural cellular data can be examined. The two coating methods display differences in the amount of nanoscopic detail that could be resolved in the nanosized membrane cytoarchitecture of BEC monolayers. The micrographical data clearly showed that Au:Pd sputter-coated samples generate descript imagery, providing useful information for profiling membrane nanostructures compared to carbon-coated samples. The recommendations regarding the contrast in two modalities would provide the necessary guidance to biological microscopists in preparing tissue culture samples for HR-SEM.

## The accuracy of absolute differential abundance analysis from relative count data.
 11.07.2022, _KE Roche, S Mukherjee_


Concerns have been raised about the use of relative abundance data derived from next generation sequencing as a proxy for absolute abundances. For example, in the differential abundance setting, compositional effects in relative abundance data may give rise to spurious differences (false positives) when considered from the absolute perspective. In practice however, relative abundances are often transformed by renormalization strategies intended to compensate for these effects and the scope of the practical problem remains unclear. We used simulated data to explore the consistency of differential abundance calling on renormalized relative abundances versus absolute abundances and find that, while overall consistency is high, with a median sensitivity (true positive rates) of 0.91 and specificity (1-false positive rates) of 0.89, consistency can be much lower where there is widespread change in the abundance of features across conditions. We confirm these findings on a large number of real data sets drawn from 16S metabarcoding, expression array, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq experiments, where data sets with the greatest change between experimental conditions are also those with the highest false positive rates. Finally, we evaluate the predictive utility of summary features of relative abundance data themselves. Estimates of sparsity and the prevalence of feature-level change in relative abundance data give reasonable predictions of discrepancy in differential abundance calling in simulated data and can provide useful bounds for worst-case outcomes in real data.

## AC-PCoA: Adjustment for confounding factors using principal coordinate analysis.
 14.07.2022, _Y Wang, F Sun, W Lin, S Zhang_


Confounding factors exist widely in various biological data owing to technical variations, population structures and experimental conditions. Such factors may mask the true signals and lead to spurious associations in the respective biological data, making it necessary to adjust confounding factors accordingly. However, existing confounder correction methods were mainly developed based on the original data or the pairwise Euclidean distance, either one of which is inadequate for analyzing different types of data, such as sequencing data. In this work, we proposed a method called Adjustment for Confounding factors using Principal Coordinate Analysis, or AC-PCoA, which reduces data dimension and extracts the information from different distance measures using principal coordinate analysis, and adjusts confounding factors across multiple datasets by minimizing the associations between lower-dimensional representations and confounding variables. Application of the proposed method was further extended to classification and prediction. We demonstrated the efficacy of AC-PCoA on three simulated datasets and five real datasets. Compared to the existing methods, AC-PCoA shows better results in visualization, statistical testing, clustering, and classification.
