## The Role of Gut Microbiota in the Neuroprotective Effects of Selenium in Alzheimer's Disease.
 16.07.2024, _AV Skalny, M Aschner, A Santamaria, T Filippini, VA Gritsenko, Y Tizabi, F Zhang, X Guo, JBT Rocha, AA Tinkov_


The objective of the present review was to provide a timely update on the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial role of Se in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and discuss the potential role of gut microbiota modulation in this neuroprotective effect. The existing data demonstrate that selenoproteins P, M, S, R, as well as glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases are involved in regulation of Aβ formation and aggregation, tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles formation, as well as mitigate the neurotoxic effects of Aβ and phospho-tau. Correspondingly, supplementation with various forms of Se in cellular and animal models of AD was shown to reduce Aβ formation, tau phosphorylation, reverse the decline in brain antioxidant levels, inhibit neuronal oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production, improve synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, altogether resulting in improved cognitive functions. In addition, most recent findings demonstrate that these neuroprotective effects are associated with Se-induced modulation of gut microbiota. In animal models of AD, Se supplementation was shown to improve gut microbiota biodiversity with a trend to increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Desulfivibrio, while reducing that of Lachnospiracea_NK4A136, Rikenella, and Helicobacter. Moreover, the relative abundance of Se-affected taxa was significantly associated with Aβ accumulation, tau phosphorylation, neuronal oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, indicative of the potential role of gut microbiota to mediate the neuroprotective effects of Se in AD. Hypothetically, modulation of gut microbiota along with Se supplementation may improve the efficiency of the latter in AD, although further detailed laboratory and clinical studies are required.

## The oral-gut microbiome axis in health and disease.
 22.07.2024, _BJ Kunath, C De Rudder, CC Laczny, E Letellier, P Wilmes_


The human body hosts trillions of microorganisms throughout many diverse habitats with different physico-chemical characteristics. Among them, the oral cavity and the gut harbour some of the most dense and diverse microbial communities. Although these two sites are physiologically distinct, they are directly connected and can influence each other in several ways. For example, oral microorganisms can reach and colonize the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the context of gut dysbiosis. However, the mechanisms of colonization and the role that the oral microbiome plays in causing or exacerbating diseases in other organs have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we describe recent advances in our understanding of how the oral and intestinal microbiota interplay in relation to their impact on human health and disease.

## Temporal dynamics and species-level complexity of Prevotella spp. in the human gut microbiota: implications for enterotypes and health.
 24.07.2024, _N Han, X Peng, T Zhang, Y Qiang, X Li, W Zhang_


The concept of "enterotypes" in microbiome research has attracted substantial interest, particularly focusing on the abundance of Prevotella spp. in the human gut. In this study, the intricate dynamics of Prevotella spp. in the human gut microbiota was investigated, based on the metagenomic method. First, 239 fecal samples from individuals across four regions of China revealed a bimodal distribution, highlighting the abundance and variability in Prevotella spp. within the Chinese population. Second, the longitudinal cohort study included 184 fecal samples from 52 time points collected from seven individuals who demonstrated either the outbreaks or disappearances of Prevotella spp., emphasizing the transient nature of Prevotella abundance levels and suggesting shifts in Prevotella "enterotypes." Furthermore, a turnover of the dominant Prevotella spp. was observed, indicating the potential presence of diverse subtypes of Prevotella enterotype. Notably, the genomic analysis demonstrated the persistence of specific Prevotella strains within individuals over extended periods, highlighting the enduring presence of Prevotella in the human gut. In conclusion, by integrating the temporal and geographical scales in our research, we gained deeper insights into the dynamics of Prevotella, emphasizing the importance of considering the dynamics at the time and species level in gut microbiota studies and their implications on human health.

## Improving insulin resistance by sulforaphane via activating the Bacteroides and Lactobacillus SCFAs-GPR-GLP1 signal axis.
 24.07.2024, _S Tian, Y Lei, F Zhao, J Che, Y Wu, P Lei, YE Kang, Y Shan_


Background: Insulin resistance (IR) is closely associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and the gut microbiome contributes to the development of NAFLD. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a phytochemical in cruciferous vegetables that could improve lipid metabolism disorder. However, whether SFN can alleviate IR in NAFLD by regulating the intestinal flora remains unclear. Methods: SFN was administered to high fat diet (HFD)-fed Wistar rats for 10 weeks. Gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA sequencing and the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gas chromatography. The expression of tight junction protein and the numbers of Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium were determined by qPCR. The expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 41/43 (GPR41/43) was determined by western blot. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in NAFLD patients with broccoli seed tablets (rich in SFN, 42 mg d-1) as intervention for 12 weeks. Thirty-six volunteers with abnormal glucose before the broccoli seed tablet treatment were selected in the intervention group to analyze their blood glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IRI), homeostasis model assessment-insulin sensitivity index (HOMA-ISI) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1). Results: SFN reduced blood glucose and HOMA-IRI while increasing insulin sensitivity in HFD rats. SFN reduced glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity, and phosphorylation of serine residues of IRS-2 induced by HFD. SFN reshaped the gut microbiota composition of HFD-induced rats and, especially, increased the content of Bacteroidaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, which are related to the improvement from SFN of the blood glucose and HOMA-IRI. The increased numbers of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus were the targets of SFN to enhance the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin, thereby lowering lipopolysaccharide content to reduce inflammation, ultimately alleviating IR. Bacteroides and Lactobacillus produced SCFAs, which activated GPR41/43 to secrete GLP1. Moreover, it was also confirmed in RCT that SFN intervention increased the level of GLP1 in NAFLD patients, which was positively correlated with the reduction of blood glucose and HOMA-IR. Conclusions: SFN alleviated IR in NAFLD via the Bacteroides and Lactobacillus SCFAs-GPR41/43-GLP1 axis and protected the intestinal mucosal barrier to decrease inflammation.

## Gastroprotective and microbiome-modulating effects of ubiquinol in rats with radiation-induced enteropathy.
 24.07.2024, _WA Eraqi, WA El-Sabbagh, RK Aziz, MS Elshahed, NH Youssef, NM Elkenawy_


Radiation enteritis is a frequently encountered issue for patients receiving radiotherapy and has a significant impact on cancer patients' quality of life. The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in intestinal function, yet the impact of irradiation on gut microorganisms is not fully understood. This study explores the gastroprotective effect and gut microbiome-modulating potential of ubiquinol (Ubq), the reduced form of the powerful antioxidant CoQ-10. For this purpose, male albino rats were randomly assigned to four groups: Control, IRR (acute 7 Gy γ-radiation), Ubq_Post (Ubq for 7 days post-irradiation), and Ubq_Pre/Post (Ubq for 7 days pre and 7 days post-irradiation). The fecal microbiomes of all groups were profiled by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing followed by bioinformatics and statistical analysis. Histopathological examination of intestinal tissue indicated severe damage in the irradiated group, which was mitigated by ubiquinol with enhanced regeneration, goblet cells, and intestinal alkaline phosphatase expression. Compared to the irradiated group, the Ubq-treated groups had a significant recovery of intestinal interleukin-1β, caspase-3, nitric oxide metabolites, and thio-barbituric reactive substances to near-healthy levels. Ubq_Pre/Post group displayed elevated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ) level, suggesting heightened benefits. Serum insulin reduction in irradiated rats improved post-Ubq treatment, with a possible anti-inflammatory effect on the pancreatic tissue. Fecal microbiota profiling revealed a dysbiosis state with a reduction of bacterial diversity post-irradiation, which was re-modulated in the Ubq treated groups to profiles that are indistinguishable from the control group. These findings underscore Ubq's gastroprotective effects against radiation-induced enteritis and its potential in restoring the gut microbiota's diversity and balance.

## Viral Communities Suppress the Earthworm Gut Antibiotic Resistome by Lysing Bacteria on a National Scale.
 22.07.2024, _S Du, L Bi, D Lin, XQ Zheng, R Neilson, D Zhu_


Earthworms are critical in regulating soil processes and act as filters for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Yet, the geographic patterns and main drivers of earthworm gut ARGs remain largely unknown. We collected 52 earthworm and soil samples from arable and forest ecosystems along a 3000 km transect across China, analyzing the diversity and abundance of ARGs using shotgun metagenomics. Earthworm guts harbored a lower diversity and abundance of ARGs compared to soil, resulting in a stronger distance-decay rate of ARGs in the gut. Greater deterministic assembly processes of ARGs were found in the gut than in soil. The earthworm gut had a lower frequency of co-occurrence patterns between ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in forest than in arable systems. Viral diversity was higher in the gut compared to soil and was negatively correlated with bacterial diversity. Bacteria such as Streptomyces and Pseudomonas were potential hosts of both viruses and ARGs. Viruses had negative effects on the diversity and abundance of ARGs, likely due to the lysis on ARG-bearing bacteria. These findings provide new insights into the variations of ARGs in the earthworm gut and highlight the vital role of viruses in the regulation of ARGs in the soil ecosystem.

## Modulation of gut microbiota composition and predicted metabolic capacity after nutritional programming with a plant-rich diet in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): insights across developmental stages.
 04.07.2024, _MM Tawfik, M Lorgen-Ritchie, E Król, S McMillan, F Norambuena, DI Bolnick, A Douglas, DR Tocher, MB Betancor, SAM Martin_


To promote sustainable aquaculture, the formulation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) feeds has changed in recent decades, focusing on replacing standard marine-based ingredients with plant-based alternatives, increasingly demonstrating successful outcomes in terms of fish performance. However, little is known about how these plant-based diets may impact the gut microbiota at first feeding and onwards. Nutritional programming (NP) is one strategy applied for exposing fish to a plant-based (V) diet at an early stage in life to promote full utilisation of plant-based ingredients and prevent potential adverse impacts of exposure to a plant-rich diet later in life. We investigated the impact of NP on gut microbiota by introducing fish to plant ingredients (V fish) during first feeding for a brief period of two weeks (stimulus phase) and compared those to fish fed a marine-based diet (M fish). Results demonstrated that V fish not only maintained growth performance at 16 (intermediate phase) and 22 (challenge phase) weeks post first feeding (wpff) when compared to M fish but also modulated gut microbiota. PERMANOVA general effects revealed gut microbiota dissimilarity by fish group (V vs. M fish) and phases (stimulus vs. intermediate vs. challenge). However, no interaction effect of both groups and phases was demonstrated, suggesting a sustained impact of V diet (nutritional history) on fish across time points/phases. Moreover, the V diet exerted a significant cumulative modulatory effect on the Atlantic salmon gut microbiota at 16 wpff that was not demonstrated at two wpff, although both fish groups were fed the M diet at 16 wpff. The nutritional history/dietary regime is the main NP influencing factor, whereas environmental and host factors significantly impacted microbiota composition in M fish. Microbial metabolic reactions of amino acid metabolism were higher in M fish when compared to V fish at two wpff suggesting microbiota played a role in digesting the essential amino acids of M feed. The excessive mucin O-degradation revealed in V fish at two wpff was mitigated in later life stages after NP, suggesting physiological adaptability and tolerance to V diet. Future studies are required to explore more fully how the microbiota functionally contributes to the NP.

## MIDASim: a fast and simple simulator for realistic microbiome data.
 24.07.2024, _M He, N Zhao, GA Satten_


_Humans, Microbiota, Computer Simulation, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Software, Computational Biology, Bacteria, Female_
Advances in sequencing technology has led to the discovery of associations between the human microbiota and many diseases, conditions, and traits. With the increasing availability of microbiome data, many statistical methods have been developed for studying these associations. The growing number of newly developed methods highlights the need for simple, rapid, and reliable methods to simulate realistic microbiome data, which is essential for validating and evaluating the performance of these methods. However, generating realistic microbiome data is challenging due to the complex nature of microbiome data, which feature correlation between taxa, sparsity, overdispersion, and compositionality. Current methods for simulating microbiome data are deficient in their ability to capture these important features of microbiome data, or can require exorbitant computational time.
