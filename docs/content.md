Clostridioides difficile is a spore-forming anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium responsible for a broad spectrum of intestinal symptoms and healthcare associated diarrhoea. The hypothesis of this work was that different in vitro conditions, notably pH and human faecal microbiota composition impact the germination or/and the growth of C. difficile. This study aimed to correlate growth kinetics of the bacterium with these two physiochemical parameters by using a static in vitro model. To better understand the initial gut colonization, several growth curve assays were carried out to monitor the behaviour of the spores and vegetative forms of a C. difficile strain 078 under different conditions mimicking the gut environment. When the faeces were added, no spore germination or growth was observed but C. difficile spores germinated in vitro when the pH was maintained between 6.6-6.9 regardless of four faeces donor. The evolution of microbiota studied by 16S rDNA profiling showed high proportions of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli/Shigella when C. difficile grew regardless of the inoculated faeces. This model helped us to understand that the germination and the growth of C. difficile is strongly pH dependent, and further research is needed to evaluate the potential impact of the gut microbiota composition on C. difficile.

## Polymorphic microbes: a new emerging hallmark of cancer.
 04.09.2022, _MP Lythgoe, BH Mullish, AE Frampton, J Krell_


Recognition of the microbiome (and 'polymorphic microbes' within them) as a new emerging hallmark of cancer reflects a wide body of rapidly evolving research. Microbes may be directly carcinogenic, impact host immune responses to promote malignancy, and may be key effectors in determining the efficacy of anticancer therapy. Manipulation of the microbiome is showing promise as an opportunity to influence cancer outcomes.

## A taxonomic note on the genus Prevotella: Description of four novel genera and emended description of the genera Hallella and Xylanibacter.
 06.09.2022, _TCA Hitch, K Bisdorf, A Afrizal, T Riedel, J Overmann, T Strowig, T Clavel_


The genus Prevotella comprises 55 species with validly published, and correct, names (at June 2021) that are phenotypically, ecologically and functionally diverse. This study used a range of comparative genome approaches (marker gene-based genome phylogeny, core genome phylogeny, average amino acid identity, percentage of conserved proteins and clade-specific marker genes) to identify large differences between the 53 species for which genomes are available, as well as two effectively published yet not validly named species and four novel species. These differences were consistent between the various analysis methods and justify the separation of Prevotella into multiple genera. While the distribution across 19 ecosystem types was unique for each species and inconsistent within clades, the functional repertoire based on the presence/absence of both PFAMs and CAZy families revealed distinct clustering based on the proposed genera. Based on the integration of all results, we propose the reclassification of species previously assigned to the genus Prevotella into seven genera, including four novel genera for which the names Segatella, Hoylesella, Leyella and Palleniella are proposed. In addition to the reclassification of Prevotella, this work describes four novel species, Hallella faecis, Xylanibacter rodentium, Xylanibacter muris, and Palleniella intestinalis.

## A curated data resource of 214K metagenomes for characterization of the global antimicrobial resistome.
 06.09.2022, _HM Martiny, P Munk, C Brinch, FM Aarestrup, TN Petersen_


The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) calls for new epidemiological surveillance methods, as well as a deeper understanding of how antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) have been transmitted around the world. The large pool of sequencing data available in public repositories provides an excellent resource for monitoring the temporal and spatial dissemination of AMR in different ecological settings. However, only a limited number of research groups globally have the computational resources to analyze such data. We retrieved 442 Tbp of sequencing reads from 214,095 metagenomic samples from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and aligned them using a uniform approach against ARGs and 16S/18S rRNA genes. Here, we present the results of this extensive computational analysis and share the counts of reads aligned. Over 6.76∙108 read fragments were assigned to ARGs and 3.21∙109 to rRNA genes, where we observed distinct differences in both the abundance of ARGs and the link between microbiome and resistome compositions across various sampling types. This collection is another step towards establishing global surveillance of AMR and can serve as a resource for further research into the environmental spread and dynamic changes of ARGs.

## Does exposure to different types of menstrual protections affect the vaginal environment?
 04.09.2022, _N Tessandier, IB Uysal, B Elie, C Selinger, C Bernat, V Boué, S Grasset, S Groc, M Rahmoun, B Reyné, N Bender, M Bonneau, C Graf, V Tribout, V Foulongne, J Ravel, T Waterboer, C Hirtz, IG Bravo, J Reynes, M Segondy, CL Murall, N Boulle, T Kamiya, S Alizon_


The vaginal ecosystem is a key component of women's health. It also represents an ideal system for ecologists to investigate the consequence of perturbations on species diversity and emerging properties between organisational levels. Here, we study how exposure to different types of menstrual protection products is linked to microbial, immunological, demographic, and behavioural measurements in a cohort of young adult women who reported using more often tampons (n = 107) or menstrual cups (n = 31). We first found that cup users were older and smoked less than tampon users. When analysing health indicators, we detected potential associations between cups use reporting and fungal genital infection. A multivariate analysis confirmed that, in our cohort, reporting using cups over tampons was associated with the higher odds ratio to report a fungal genital infection diagnosis by a medical doctor within the last 3 months. We did not detect significant differences between groups in terms of their bacterial vaginal microbiota composition and found marginal differences in the level of expression of 20 cytokines. However, a multivariate analysis of these biological data identified some level of clustering based on the type of menstrual production preferred (cups or tampons). These results suggest that exposure to different types of menstrual products could influence menstrual health. Larger studies and studies with a more powered setting are needed to assess the robustness of these associations and identify causal mechanisms.

## Characterization of the oral and fecal microbiota associated with atopic dermatitis in dogs selected from a purebred Shiba Inu colony.
 06.09.2022, _J Uchiyama, T Osumi, K Mizukami, T Fukuyama, A Shima, A Unno, I Takemura-Uchiyama, Y Une, H Murakami, M Sakaguchi_


Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and relapsing multifactorial inflammatory skin disease that also affects dogs. The oral and gut microbiota are associated with many disorders, including allergy. Few studies have addressed the oral and gut microbiota in dogs, although the skin microbiota has been studied relatively well in these animals. Here, we studied the AD-associated oral and gut microbiota in 16 healthy and nine AD dogs from a purebred Shiba Inu colony. We found that the diversity of the oral microbiota was significantly different among the dogs, whereas no significant difference was observed in the gut microbiota. Moreover, a differential abundance analysis detected the Family_XIII_AD3011_group (Anaerovoracaceae) in the gut microbiota of AD dogs; however, no bacterial taxa were detected in the oral microbiota. Third, the comparison of the microbial co-occurrence patterns between AD and healthy dogs identified differential networks in which the bacteria in the oral microbiota that were most strongly associated with AD were related with human periodontitis, whereas those in the gut microbiota were related with dysbiosis and gut inflammation. These results suggest that AD can alter the oral and gut microbiota in dogs.

## Rapid screening of antimicrobial probiotics using CRISPR cascade.
 06.09.2022, _Y Lu, F Li, J Bai, R Ledesma-Amaro, D Liu, Q He, R Deng_


Animal bacterial infection is increasingly threatening human health. Here we report a nucleic acid amplification-free CRISPR genetic assay that allows to rapidly screen potential food-origin antimicrobial probiotics. The assay (termed CRISPRzyme assay) is based on a CRISPR-DNAzyme cascade, where the target gene sequentially activated Cas12a protein and DNAzyme, yielding a limit of detection of 62 CFU Vibrio parahaemolyticus, 86 CFU Salmonella Typhimurium, and 82 CFU Listeria monocytogenes. The elimination of nucleic acid amplification shortens processing time and operational complexity. The assay was used to rapidly screen antimicrobial probiotics by end-measurement of fluorescence of pathogenic bacteria. Particularly, it can estimate the in vivo antimicrobial effect due to its capacity for pathogen quantification in complex samples. We found that isolates of Bacillus and lactic acid bacteria separated from fermented food exhibited strong antimicrobial activity for fish pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and identified surfactin as the key antimicrobial component. The CRISPRzyme assay could ease antimicrobial probiotics screening, and constitutes a new tool for combatting pathogenic bacterial contamination and infection.

## Longitudinal analysis of the rectal microbiome in dogs with diabetes mellitus after initiation of insulin therapy.
 06.09.2022, _NL Laia, PC Barko, DR Sullivan, MA McMichael, DA Williams, JM Reinhart_


There have been numerous studies in humans and rodents substantiating the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome in the pathogenesis and progression of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is a common endocrinopathy in dogs; however, little is known about the composition of the gut microbiome during the development and treatment of diabetes in this species. The objective of this pilot study was to characterize the gastrointestinal microbiome of dogs with diabetes mellitus at the time of diagnosis and over the first 12 weeks of insulin therapy and identify associations with glycemic control. Rectal swabs and serum for fructosamine measurement were collected from 6 newly diagnosed diabetic dogs at 2-week intervals for 12 weeks. Rectal samples were sequenced using 16S, ITS, and archaeal primers. Measures of alpha and beta diversity were assessed for changes over time; associations between absolute sequence variant (ASV) relative abundances and time and fructosamine concentration were identified using a microbiome-specific, multivariate linear effects model. No statistically significant changes over time were noted in alpha diversity and samples significantly grouped by dog rather than by time in the beta diversity analysis. However, multiple ASVs were negatively (Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Romboutsia, Collinsella) and positively (Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus gauveauii, Peptoclostridium) associated with time and two ASVs were positively associated with fructosamine (Enterococcus, Escherichia-Shigella). These changes in gastrointestinal microbial composition warrant further investigation of how they may relate to diabetes mellitus progression or control in dogs.

## Core Microbiota in the Rhizosphere of Heavy Metal Accumulators and Its Contribution to Plant Performance.
 06.09.2022, _J Luo, S Gu, X Guo, Y Liu, Q Tao, HP Zhao, Y Liang, S Banerjee, T Li_


Persistent microbial symbioses can confer greater fitness to their host under unfavorable conditions, but manipulating such beneficial interactions necessitates a mechanistic understanding of the consistently important microbiomes for the plant. Here, we examined the phylogenetic profiles and plant-beneficial traits of the core microbiota that consistently inhabits the rhizosphere of four divergent Cd hyperaccumulators and an accumulator. We evidenced the existence of a conserved core rhizosphere microbiota in each plant distinct from that in the non-hyperaccumulating plant. Members of Burkholderiaceae and Sphingomonas were the shared cores across hyperaccumulators and accumulators. Several keystone taxa in the rhizosphere networks were part of the core microbiota, the abundance of which was an important predictor of plant Cd accumulation. Furthermore, an inoculation experiment with synthetic communities comprising isolates belonging to the shared cores indicated that core microorganisms could facilitate plant growth and metal tolerance. Using RNA-based stable isotope probing, we discovered that abundant core taxa overlapped with active rhizobacteria utilizing root exudates, implying that the core rhizosphere microbiota assimilating plant-derived carbon may provide benefits to plant growth and host phenotype such as Cd accumulation. Our study suggests common principles underpinning hyperaccumulator-microbiome interactions, where plants consistently interact with a core set of microbes contributing to host fitness and plant performance. These findings lay the foundation for harnessing the persistent root microbiomes to accelerate the restoration of metal-disturbed soils.

## Global contribution of pelagic fungi to protein degradation in the ocean.
 04.09.2022, _E Breyer, Z Zhao, GJ Herndl, F Baltar_


Fungi are important degraders of organic matter responsible for reintegration of nutrients into global food chains in freshwater and soil environments. Recent evidence suggests that they are ubiquitously present in the oceanic water column where they play an active role in the degradation of carbohydrates. However, their role in processing other abundant biomolecules in the ocean in comparison with that of prokaryotes remains enigmatic. Here, we performed a global-ocean multi-omics analysis of all fungal-affiliated peptidases (main enzymes responsible for cleaving proteins), which constitute the major fraction (&gt; 50%) of marine living and detrital biomass. We determined the abundance, expression, diversity, taxonomic affiliation, and functional classification of the genes encoding all pelagic fungal peptidases from the epi- and mesopelagic layers.
