## Population bottlenecks constrain host microbiome diversity and genetic variation impeding fitness.
 23.05.2022, _M Ørsted, E Yashiro, AA Hoffmann, TN Kristensen_


It is becoming increasingly clear that microbial symbionts influence key aspects of their host's fitness, and vice versa. This may fundamentally change our thinking about how microbes and hosts interact in influencing fitness and adaptation to changing environments. Here we explore how reductions in population size commonly experienced by threatened species influence microbiome diversity. Consequences of such reductions are normally interpreted in terms of a loss of genetic variation, increased inbreeding and associated inbreeding depression. However, fitness effects of population bottlenecks might also be mediated through microbiome diversity, such as through loss of functionally important microbes. Here we utilise 50 Drosophila melanogaster lines with different histories of population bottlenecks to explore these questions. The lines were phenotyped for egg-to-adult viability and their genomes sequenced to estimate genetic variation. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified in these lines to investigate microbial diversity. We found that 1) host population bottlenecks constrained microbiome richness and diversity, 2) core microbiomes of hosts with low genetic variation were constituted from subsets of microbiomes found in flies with higher genetic variation, 3) both microbiome diversity and host genetic variation contributed to host population fitness, 4) connectivity and robustness of bacterial networks was low in the inbred lines regardless of host genetic variation, 5) reduced microbial diversity was associated with weaker evolutionary responses of hosts in stressful environments, and 6) these effects were unrelated to Wolbachia density. These findings suggest that population bottlenecks reduce hologenomic variation (combined host and microbial genetic variation). Thus, while the current biodiversity crisis focuses on population sizes and genetic variation of eukaryotes, an additional focal point should be the microbial diversity carried by the eukaryotes, which in turn may influence host fitness and adaptability with consequences for the persistence of populations.

## Climate change, the cutaneous microbiome and skin disease: implications for a warming world.
 22.05.2022, _MF Isler, SJ Coates, MD Boos_


The skin plays an important role in human health by providing barrier protection against environmental stressors. In addition to human skin cells, the cutaneous barrier is also home to a network of organisms that have co-evolved with humans, referred to as the cutaneous microbiome. This network has been demonstrated to play an active role in skin health and the manifestation of cutaneous disease. Here, we review how a warming world and its attendant changes in climatic variables, including temperature, humidity, ultraviolet radiation, and air pollution, influence the cutaneous microbiome and, in turn, skin health. Studies indicate that the cutaneous microbiome is affected by these factors, and these changes may influence the epidemiology and severity of cutaneous disorders including atopic dermatitis, acne vulgaris, psoriasis, and skin cancer. Further investigation into how the cutaneous microbiome changes in response to climate change and subsequently influences skin disease is needed to better anticipate future dermatologic needs and potentially generate novel therapeutic solutions in response.

## Species- and strain-level assessment using rrn long-amplicons suggests donor's influence on gut microbial transference via fecal transplants in metabolic syndrome subjects.
 24.05.2022, _A Benítez-Páez, AV Hartstra, M Nieuwdorp, Y Sanz_


Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently used for treating Clostridium difficile infection and explored for other clinical applications in experimental trials. However, the effectiveness of this therapy could vary, and partly depend on the donor's bacterial species engraftment, whose evaluation is challenging because there are no cost-effective strategies for accurately tracking the microbe transference. In this regard, the precise identification of bacterial species inhabiting the human gut is essential to define their role in human health unambiguously. We used Nanopore-based device to sequence bacterial rrn operons (16S-ITS-23S) and to reveal species-level abundance changes in the human gut microbiota of a FMT trial. By assessing the donor and recipient microbiota before and after FMT, we further evaluated whether this molecular approach reveals strain-level genetic variation to demonstrate microbe transfer and engraftment. Strict control over sequencing data quality and major microbiota covariates was critical for accurately estimating the changes in gut microbial species abundance in the recipients after FMT. We detected strain-level variation via single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) at rrn regions in a species-specific manner. We showed that it was possible to explore successfully the donor-bacterial strain (e.g., Parabacteroides merdae) engraftment in recipients of the FMT by assessing the nucleotide frequencies at rrn-associated SNVs. Our findings indicate that the engraftment of donors' microbiota is to some extent correlated with the improvement of metabolic health in recipients and that parameters such as the baseline gut microbiota configuration, sex, and age of donors should be considered to ensure the success of FMT in humans. The study was prospectively registered at the Dutch Trial registry - NTR4488 (https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/4488).
