Globally, stunting affects ∼150 million children under five, while wasting affects nearly 50 million. Current interventions have had limited effectiveness in ameliorating long-term sequelae of undernutrition including stunting, cognitive deficits and immune dysfunction. Disrupted development of the gut microbiota has been linked to the pathogenesis of undernutrition, providing potentially new treatment approaches.

## Association of methyl donor nutrients dietary intake and sleep disorders in the elderly revealed by the intestinal microbiome.
 04.06.2024, _Q Chen, R Fan, L Song, S Wang, M You, M Cai, Y Wu, Y Li, M Xu_


Currently, sleep disorders (SD) in the elderly are gaining prominence globally and are becoming a significant public health concern. Methyl donor nutrients (MDNs), such as vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate, and choline, have been reported to have the potential to improve sleep disorders. Moreover, MDNs help to maintain gut flora homeostasis, and are closely associated with the development of SD. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of comprehensive human studies examining the association between MDNs intake and SD. In our study, we comprehensively evaluated the association between MDNs intake and SD in the elderly and used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to explore the underlying mechanism. We found that the SD group (n = 91) had a lower methyl-donor nutritional quality index (MNQI) and a trend toward lower intake compared to the control group (n = 147). Based on the intestinal microbiome, the beta diversity of the intestinal flora was higher in the high methyl-donor nutritional quality (HQ) group compared to the low methyl-donor nutritional quality (LQ) group, and it was lower in the SD group compared to the control group. This suggests that MDNs may regulate sleep by modulating the abundance distribution of the microbiota. Subsequently, we performed correlation analyses between the relative abundance of the microbiota, MDNs intake, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), identifying five genera with potential regulatory roles. The KEGG pathway analysis indicated that energy metabolism and one-carbon metabolism might be the pathways through which MDNs modulate sleep. This study offers dietary guidance strategies for managing SD in the elderly and provides insights for targeted microbiota intervention.

## The human gut microbiome and aging.
 04.06.2024, _E Bradley, J Haran_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Aging, Bacteria, Longevity, Diet_
The composition of the human gut microbiome has been observed to change over the course of an individual's life. From birth, it is shaped by mode of delivery, diet, environmental exposures, geographic location, exposures to medications, and by aging itself. Here, we present a narrative review of the gut microbiome across the lifespan with a focus on its impacts on aging and age-related diseases in humans. We will describe how it is shaped, and features of the gut microbiome that have been associated with diseases at different phases of life and how this can adversely affect healthy aging. Across the lifespan, and especially in old age, a diverse microbiome that includes organisms suspected to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, has been reported to be associated with healthy aging. These findings have been remarkably consistent across geographic regions of the world suggesting that they could be universal features of healthy aging across all cultures and genetic backgrounds. Exactly how these features of the microbiome affect biologic processes associated with aging thus promoting healthy aging will be crucial to targeting the gut microbiome for interventions that will support health and longevity.

## Nurturing gut health: role of m6A RNA methylation in upholding the intestinal barrier.
 06.06.2024, _S Wang, Y Yang, X Jiang, X Zheng, Q Wei, W Dai, X Zhang_


The intestinal lumen acts as a critical interface connecting the external environment with the body's internal state. It's essential to prevent the passage of harmful antigens and bacteria while facilitating nutrient and water absorption. The intestinal barriers encompass microbial, mechanical, immunological, and chemical elements, working together to maintain intestinal balance. Numerous studies have associated m6A modification with intestinal homeostasis. This review comprehensively outlines potential mechanisms through which m6A modification could initiate, exacerbate, or sustain barrier damage from an intestinal perspective. The pivotal role of m6A modification in preserving intestinal equilibrium provides new insights, guiding the exploration of m6A modification as a target for optimizing preventive and therapeutic strategies for intestinal homeostasis.

Circadian homeostasis in mammals is a key intrinsic mechanism for responding to the external environment. However, the interplay between circadian rhythms and the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its influence on metastasis are still unclear. Here, in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), disturbances of circadian rhythm and the accumulation of monocytes and granulocytes were closely related to metastasis. Moreover, dysregulation of circadian rhythm promoted lung metastasis of CRC by inducing the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and dysfunctional CD8+ T cells in the lungs of mice. Also, gut microbiota and its derived metabolite taurocholic acid (TCA) contributed to lung metastasis of CRC by triggering the accumulation of MDSCs in mice. Mechanistically, TCA promoted glycolysis of MDSCs epigenetically by enhancing mono-methylation of H3K4 of target genes and inhibited CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of PDL1. Our study links the biological clock with MDSCs in the TME through gut microbiota/metabolites in controlling the metastatic spread of CRC, uncovering a systemic mechanism for cancer metastasis.

Critical illness can significantly alter the composition and function of the human microbiome, but few studies have examined these changes over time. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the oral, lung, and gut microbiota in 479 mechanically ventilated patients (223 females, 256 males) with acute respiratory failure. We use advanced DNA sequencing technologies, including Illumina amplicon sequencing (utilizing 16S and ITS rRNA genes for bacteria and fungi, respectively, in all sample types) and Nanopore metagenomics for lung microbiota. Our results reveal a progressive dysbiosis in all three body compartments, characterized by a reduction in microbial diversity, a decrease in beneficial anaerobes, and an increase in pathogens. We find that clinical factors, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, and antibiotic exposure, are associated with specific patterns of dysbiosis. Interestingly, unsupervised clustering of lung microbiota diversity and composition by 16S independently predicted survival and performed better than traditional clinical and host-response predictors. These observations are validated in two separate cohorts of COVID-19 patients, highlighting the potential of lung microbiota as valuable prognostic biomarkers in critical care. Understanding these microbiome changes during critical illness points to new opportunities for microbiota-targeted precision medicine interventions.

## The oral microbiome and oral and upper gastrointestinal diseases.
 05.06.2024, _S Liu, S Wang, N Zhang, P Li_


Microbiomes are essential components of the human body, and their populations are substantial. Under normal circumstances, microbiomes coexist harmoniously with the human body, but disturbances in this equilibrium can lead to various diseases. The oral microbiome is involved in the occurrence and development of many oral and gastrointestinal diseases. This review focuses on the relationship between oral microbiomes and oral and upper gastrointestinal diseases, and therapeutic strategies aiming to provide valuable insights for clinical prevention and treatment.

## Candida albicans natural diversity: a resource to dissect fungal commensalism and pathogenesis.
 04.06.2024, _E Lindemann-Perez, JC Perez_


Candida albicans is a ubiquitous fungus of humans. It is not only a component of the oral and intestinal microbiota of most healthy adults but also a major cause of mucosal disorders and life-threatening disseminated infections. Until recently, research on the biology and pathogenesis of the fungus was largely based on a single clinical isolate. We review investigations that have started to dissect a diverse set of C. albicans strains. Using different approaches to leverage the species' phenotypic and/or genetic diversity, these studies illuminate the wide range of interactions between fungus and host. While connecting genetic variants to phenotypes of interest remains challenging, research on C. albicans' natural diversity is central to understand fungal commensalism and pathogenesis.

## Spatial recovery of the murine gut microbiota after antibiotics perturbation.
 04.06.2024, _M Taguer, J Xiao, R Crawford, H Shi, MP Cheng, M Citron, GD Hannigan, SH Kasper_


Bacterial communities are highly complex, with interaction networks dictating ecosystem function. Bacterial interactions are constrained by the spatial organization of these microbial communities, yet studying the spatial organization of microbial communities at the single-cell level has been technically challenging. Here, we use the recently developed high-phylogenetic-resolution microbiota mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization technology to image the gut microbiota at the species and single-cell level. We simultaneously image 63 different bacterial species to spatially characterize the perturbation and recovery of the gut microbiota to ampicillin and vancomycin in the cecum and distal colon of mice. To decipher the biology in this complex imaging data, we developed an analytical framework to characterize the spatial changes of the gut microbiota to a perturbation. The three-tiered analytical approach includes image-level diversity, pairwise colocalization analysis, and hypothesis-driven neighborhood analysis. Through this workflow, we identify biogeographic and antibiotic-based differences in the spatial organization of the gut microbiota. We demonstrate that the cecal microbiota has increased micrometer-scale diversity than the colon at baseline and recovers better from perturbation. Also, we identify potential foundation and keystone species that have high baseline neighborhood richness and that are associated with recovery from antibiotics. Through this workflow, we add a spatial layer to the characterization of bacterial communities and progress toward a better understanding of bacterial interactions leading to improved microbiome modulation strategies.

## Global biogeography of microbes driving ocean ecological status under climate change.

Microbial communities play a crucial role in ocean ecology and global biogeochemical processes. However, understanding the intricate interactions among diversity, taxonomical composition, functional traits, and how these factors respond to climate change remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose seven distinct ecological statuses by systematically considering the diversity, structure, and biogeochemical potential of the ocean microbiome to delineate their biogeography. Anthropogenic climate change is expected to alter the ecological status of the surface ocean by influencing environmental conditions, particularly nutrient and oxygen contents. Our predictive model, which utilizes machine learning, indicates that the ecological status of approximately 32.44% of the surface ocean may undergo changes from the present to the end of this century, assuming no policy interventions. These changes mainly include poleward shifts in the main taxa, increases in photosynthetic carbon fixation and decreases in nutrient metabolism. However, this proportion can decrease significantly with effective control of greenhouse gas emissions. Our study underscores the urgent necessity for implementing policies to mitigate climate change, particularly from an ecological perspective.

Seaweeds are important components of marine ecosystems with emerging potential in aquaculture and as sources of biofuel, food products and pharmacological compounds. However, an increasingly recognised threat to natural and industrial seaweed populations is infection with parasitic single-celled eukaryotes from the relatively understudied oomycete lineage. Here we examine the eukaryomes of diverse brown, red and green marine macroalgae collected from polar (Baffin Island), cold-temperate (Falkland Islands) and tropical (Ascension Island) locations, with a focus on oomycete and closely related diatom taxa. Using 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we show unexpected genetic and taxonomic diversity of the eukaryomes, a strong broad-brush association between eukaryome composition and geographic location, and some evidence of association between eukaryome structure and macroalgal phylogenetic relationships (phylosymbiosis). However, the oomycete fraction of the eukaryome showed disparate patterns of diversity and structure, highlighting much weaker association with geography and no evidence of phylosymbiosis. We present several novel haplotypes of the most common oomycete Eurychasma dicksonii and report for the first time a cosmopolitan distribution and absence of host specificity of this important pathogen. This indicates rich diversity in macroalgal oomycete pathogens and highlights that these pathogens may be generalist and highly adaptable to diverse environmental conditions.

We previously reported that asthma prevalence was higher in the United States (US) compared to Mexico (MX) (25.8% vs. 8.4%). This investigation assessed differences in microbial dust composition in relation to demographic and housing characteristics on both sides of the US-MX Border. Forty homes were recruited in the US and MX. Home visits collected floor dust and documented occupants' demographics, asthma prevalence, housing structure, and use characteristics. US households were more likely to have inhabitants who reported asthma when compared with MX households (30% vs. 5%) and had significantly different flooring types. The percentage of households on paved roads, with flushing toilets, with piped water and with air conditioning was higher in the US, while dust load was higher in MX. Significant differences exist between countries in the microbial composition of the floor dust. Dust from Mexican homes was enriched with Alishewanella, Paracoccus, Rheinheimera genera and Intrasporangiaceae family. A predictive metagenomics analysis identified 68 significantly differentially abundant functional pathways between US and MX. This study documented multiple structural, environmental, and demographic differences between homes in the US and MX that may contribute to significantly different microbial composition of dust observed in these two countries.

Microbial necromass carbon (MNC) can reflect soil carbon (C) sequestration capacity. However, changes in the reserves of MNC in response to warming in alpine grasslands across the Tibetan Plateau are currently unclear. Based on large-scale sampling and published observations, we divided eco-clusters based on dominant phylotypes, calculated their relative abundance, and found that their averaged importance to MNC was higher than most other environmental variables. With a deep learning model based on stacked autoencoder, we proved that using eco-cluster relative abundance as the input variable of the model can accurately predict the overall distribution of MNC under current and warming conditions. It implied that warming could lead to an overall increase in the MNC in grassland topsoil across the Tibetan Plateau, with an average increase of 7.49 mg/g, a 68.3% increase. Collectively, this study concludes that alpine grassland has the tendency to increase soil C sequestration capacity on the Tibetan Plateau under future warming.

## Cooperative growth in microbial communities is a driver of multistability.
 06.06.2024, _W Lopes, DR Amor, J Gore_


_Microbiota, Humans, Microbial Interactions, Bacteria, Glutamic Acid, Models, Biological, Coculture Techniques_
Microbial communities often exhibit more than one possible stable composition for the same set of external conditions. In the human microbiome, these persistent changes in species composition and abundance are associated with health and disease states, but the drivers of these alternative stable states remain unclear. Here we experimentally demonstrate that a cross-kingdom community, composed of six species relevant to the respiratory tract, displays four alternative stable states each dominated by a different species. In pairwise coculture, we observe widespread bistability among species pairs, providing a natural origin for the multistability of the full community. In contrast with the common association between bistability and antagonism, experiments reveal many positive interactions within and between community members. We find that multiple species display cooperative growth, and modeling predicts that this could drive the observed multistability within the community as well as non-canonical pairwise outcomes. A biochemical screening reveals that glutamate either reduces or eliminates cooperativity in the growth of several species, and we confirm that such supplementation reduces the extent of bistability across pairs and reduces multistability in the full community. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation of how cooperative growth rather than competitive interactions can underlie multistability in microbial communities.

## Bioenergetic mapping of 'healthy microbiomes' via compound processing potential imprinted in gut and soil metagenomes.
 04.06.2024, _C Liddicoat, RA Edwards, M Roach, JM Robinson, KJ Wallace, AD Barnes, J Brame, A Heintz-Buschart, TR Cavagnaro, EA Dinsdale, MP Doane, N Eisenhauer, G Mitchell, B Rai, SA Ramesh, MF Breed_


Despite mounting evidence of their importance in human health and ecosystem functioning, the definition and measurement of 'healthy microbiomes' remain unclear. More advanced knowledge exists on health associations for compounds used or produced by microbes. Environmental microbiome exposures (especially via soils) also help shape, and may supplement, the functional capacity of human microbiomes. Given the synchronous interaction between microbes, their feedstocks, and micro-environments, with functional genes facilitating chemical transformations, our objective was to examine microbiomes in terms of their capacity to process compounds relevant to human health. Here we integrate functional genomics and biochemistry frameworks to derive new quantitative measures of in silico potential for human gut and environmental soil metagenomes to process a panel of major compound classes (e.g., lipids, carbohydrates) and selected biomolecules (e.g., vitamins, short-chain fatty acids) linked to human health. Metagenome functional potential profile data were translated into a universal compound mapping 'landscape' based on bioenergetic van Krevelen mapping of function-level meta-compounds and corresponding functional relative abundances, reflecting imprinted genetic capacity of microbiomes to metabolize an array of different compounds. We show that measures of 'compound processing potential' associated with human health and disease (examining atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes and anxious-depressive behavior case studies), and displayed seemingly predictable shifts along gradients of ecological disturbance in plant-soil ecosystems (three case studies). Ecosystem quality explained 60-92 % of variation in soil metagenome compound processing potential measures in a post-mining restoration case study dataset. With growing knowledge of the varying proficiency of environmental microbiota to process human health associated compounds, we might design environmental interventions or nature prescriptions to modulate our exposures, thereby advancing microbiota-oriented approaches to human health. Compound processing potential offers a simplified, integrative approach for applying metagenomics in ongoing efforts to understand and quantify the role of microbiota in environmental- and human-health.

## Temporal dynamics of fecal microbiota community succession in broiler chickens, calves, and piglets under aerobic exposure.

Researchers have extensively studied the effect of oxygen on the growth and survival of bacteria. However, the impact of oxygen on bacterial community structure, particularly its ability to select for taxa within the context of a complex microbial community, is still unclear. In a 21-day microcosm experiment, we investigated the effect of aerobic exposure on the fecal community structure and succession pattern in broiler, calf, and piglet feces (n = 10 for each feces type). Bacterial diversity decreased and community structure changed rapidly in the broiler microbiome (P &lt; 0.001), while the fecal community of calves and piglets, which have higher initial diversity, was stable after initial exposure but decreased in diversity after 3 days (P &lt; 0.001). The response to aerobic exposure was host animal specific, but in all three animals, the change in community structure was driven by a decrease in anaerobic species, primarily belonging to Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (except in broilers where Bacteroidetes increased), along with an increase in aerobic species belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Using random forest regression, we identified microbial features that predict aerobic exposure. In all three animals, host-beneficial Prevotella-related ASVs decreased after exposure, while ASVs belonging to Acinetobacter, Corynbacterium, and Tissierella were increased. The decrease of Prevotella was rapid in broilers but delayed in calves and piglets. Knowing when these pathobionts increase in abundance after aerobic exposure could inform farm sanitation practices and could be important in designing animal experiments that modulate the microbiome.IMPORTANCEThe fecal microbial community is contained within a dynamic ecosystem of interacting microbes that varies in biotic and abiotic components across different animal species. Although oxygen affects bacterial growth, its specific impact on the structure of complex communities, such as those found in feces, and how these effects vary between different animal species are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the effect of aerobic exposure on the fecal microbiota was host-animal-specific, primarily driven by a decrease in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, but accompanied by an increase in Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and other pathobionts. Interestingly, we observed that more complex communities from pig and cattle exhibited initial resilience, while a less diverse community from broilers displayed a rapid response to aerobic exposure. Our findings offer insights that can inform farm sanitation practices, as well as experimental design, sample collection, and processing protocols for microbiome studies across various animal species.
