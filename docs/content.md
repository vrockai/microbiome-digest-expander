In the human gut, the growth of the pathogen Clostridioides difficile is impacted by a complex web of interspecies interactions with members of human gut microbiota. We investigate the contribution of interspecies interactions on the antibiotic response of C. difficile to clinically relevant antibiotics using bottom-up assembly of human gut communities. We identify 2 classes of microbial interactions that alter C. difficile's antibiotic susceptibility: interactions resulting in increased ability of C. difficile to grow at high antibiotic concentrations (rare) and interactions resulting in C. difficile growth enhancement at low antibiotic concentrations (common). Based on genome-wide transcriptional profiling data, we demonstrate that metal sequestration due to hydrogen sulfide production by the prevalent gut species Desulfovibrio piger increases the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of metronidazole for C. difficile. Competition with species that display higher sensitivity to the antibiotic than C. difficile leads to enhanced growth of C. difficile at low antibiotic concentrations due to competitive release. A dynamic computational model identifies the ecological principles driving this effect. Our results provide a deeper understanding of ecological and molecular principles shaping C. difficile's response to antibiotics, which could inform therapeutic interventions.

Breast cancer ranks first among female cancers and has become a major public health problem in the current society. More studies indicated that these cancers are related to the change in the gut microbiome that can cause metabolic and immune system disorders in the body. However, there are few studies on the changes in gut microbiome caused by the onset of breast cancer, and the relationship between breast cancer and gut microbiome needs to be further clarified. In this study, we inoculated 4T1 breast cancer cells to induce breast cancer tumorigenesis in mice and collected their feces samples at different stages during this process. These intestinal florae were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the results showed that at the phylum level, the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes decreased with the development of the tumor; at the family level, the intestinal microbiome had obvious variations of Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroidaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, etc. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and COG annotation demonstrated that decreased abundance of cancer-related signaling pathways. This study elucidated the relationship between breast cancer and intestinal microbiome, and the research results can be used as an important biomarker for the diagnosis of breast cancer.

Despite the number of available therapies for ulcerative colitis (UC), severe side effects and high cost has limited their clinical application. Thus, finding new alternative strategies with minimal side effects is inevitable. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches in DSS-induced colitis.

## PD1hi CD200hi CD4+ exhausted T cell increase immunotherapy resistance and tumour progression by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition in bladder cancer.

Bladder cancer (BLCA) is one of the most diagnosed cancers in humans worldwide. Recently, immunotherapy has become a main treatment option for BC. However, most BLCA patients do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors or relapse after immunotherapy. Therefore, it is very important to identify novel biomarkers for the prediction of immunotherapy response in B patients.

## Insect phylogeny structures the bacterial communities in the microbiome of psyllids (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) in Aotearoa New Zealand.

The bacterial microbiome of psyllids has been studied for decades, with a strong focus on the primary and secondary endosymbionts capable of providing essential amino acids for the insects' diet and therefore playing a key role in the insects' ability to radiate on novel plant hosts. Here, we combine metabarcoding analysis of the bacterial communities hosted by psyllids with a multi-gene phylogenetic analysis of the insect hosts to determine what factors influence the bacterial diversity of the psyllids' microbiomes, especially in the context of the dispersal and evolutionary radiation of these insects in Aotearoa New Zealand. Using multi-gene phylogenetics with COI, 18S and EF-1Î± sequences from 102 psyllid species, we confirmed for the first time monophyly for all the six genera of native/endemic Aotearoa New Zealand psyllids, with indications that they derive from at least six dispersal events to the country. This also revealed that, after its ancestral arrival, the genus Powellia has radiated onto a larger and more diverse range of plants than either Psylla or Ctenarytaina, which is uncommon amongst monophyletic psyllids globally. DNA metabarcoding of the bacterial 16S gene here represents the largest dataset analysed to date from psyllids, including 246 individuals from 73 species. This provides novel evidence that bacterial diversity across psyllid species is strongly associated with psyllid phylogenetic structure, and to a lesser degree to their host plant association and geographic distribution. Furthermore, while the strongest co-phylogenetic signals were derived from the primary and secondary symbionts, a signal of phylosymbiosis was still retained among the remaining taxa of the bacterial microbiome, suggesting potential vertical transmission of bacterial lineages previously unknown to have symbiotic roles.

## Beyond pathogenesis: Detecting the full spectrum of ecological interactions in the virosphere.
 23.05.2023, _SD Jurburg, EFY Hom, A Chatzinotas_


_Viruses, Symbiosis_
The public perception of viruses has historically been negative. We are now at a stage where the development of tools to study viruses is at an all-time high, but society's perception of viruses is at an all-time low. The literature regarding viral interactions has been skewed towards negative (i.e., pathogenic) symbioses, whereas viral mutualisms remain relatively underexplored. Viral interactions with their hosts are complex and some non-pathogenic viruses could have potential benefits to society. However, viral research is seldom designed to identify viral mutualists, a gap that merits considering new experimental designs. Determining whether antagonisms, mutualisms, and commensalisms are equally common ecological strategies requires more balanced research efforts that characterize the full spectrum of viral interactions.

## Phage therapy and the public: Increasing awareness essential to widespread use.

Today, the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis is shaping a world where previously treatable infections can kill. This has revitalised the development of antibiotic alternatives, such as phage therapy. The therapeutic use of phages, viruses that infect and kill bacteria, was first explored over a century ago. However, most of the Western world abandoned phage therapy in favour of antibiotics. While the technical feasibility of phage therapy has been increasingly investigated in recent years, there has been minimal effort to understand and tackle the social challenges that may hinder its development and implementation. In this study, we assess the UK public's awareness, acceptance, preferences and opinions regarding phage therapy using a survey, fielded on the Prolific online research platform. The survey contained two embedded experiments: a conjoint and framing experiment (N = 787). We demonstrate that acceptance of phage therapy among the lay public is already moderate, with a mean likelihood of acceptance of 4.71 on a scale of 1 (not at all likely to accept phage therapy) to 7 (very likely to accept phage therapy). However, priming participants to think about novel medicines and antibiotic resistance significantly increases their likelihood of using phage therapy. Moreover, the conjoint experiment reveals that success and side effect rate, treatment duration, and where the medicine has been approved for use has a statistically significant effect on participants' treatment preferences. Investigations altering the framing of phage therapy, to highlight positive and negative aspects, reveal a higher acceptance of the treatment when described without using perceived harsh words, such as "kill" and "virus". Combined, this information provides an initial insight into how phage therapy could be developed and introduced in the UK to maximise acceptance rate.
