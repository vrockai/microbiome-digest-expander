Endometriosis is an estrogen dependent gynecological disease associated with altered microbial phenotypes. The association among endogenous estrogen, estrogen metabolites, and microbial dynamics on disease pathogenesis has not been fully investigated. Here, we identified estrogen metabolites as well as microbial phenotypes in non-diseased patients (n = 9) and those with pathologically confirmed endometriosis (P-EOSIS, n = 20), on day of surgery (DOS) and ~1-3 weeks post-surgical intervention (PSI). Then, we examined the effects of surgical intervention with or without hormonal therapy (OCPs) on estrogen and microbial profiles of both study groups. For estrogen metabolism analysis, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify urinary estrogens. The microbiome data assessment was performed with Next generation sequencing to V4 region of 16S rRNA. Surgical intervention and hormonal therapy altered gastrointestinal (GI), urogenital (UG) microbiomes, urinary estrogen and estrogen metabolite levels in P-EOSIS. At DOS, 17β-estradiol was enhanced in P-EOSIS treated with OCPs. At PSI, 16-keto-17β-estradiol was increased in P-EOSIS not receiving OCPs while 2-hydroxyestradiol and 2-hydroxyestrone were decreased in P-EOSIS receiving OCPs. GI bacterial α-diversity was greater for controls and P-EOSIS that did not receive OCPs. P-EOSIS not utilizing OCPs exhibited a decrease in UG bacterial α-diversity and differences in dominant taxa, while P-EOSIS utilizing OCPs had an increase in UG bacterial α-diversity. P-EOSIS had a strong positive correlation between the GI/UG bacteria species and the concentrations of urinary estrogen and its metabolites. These results indicate an association between microbial dysbiosis and altered urinary estrogens in P-EOSIS, which may impact disease progression.

## Uncovering the Role of Gut Microbiota in Amino Acid Metabolic Disturbances in Heart Failure Through Metagenomic Analysis.
 17.12.2021, _T Hayashi, T Yamashita, T Takahashi, T Tabata, H Watanabe, Y Gotoh, M Shinohara, K Kami, H Tanaka, K Matsumoto, T Hayashi, T Yamada, KI Hirata_


Aims: Circulating amino acid (AA) abnormalities serve as predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). However, the role of the gut microbiota in AA disturbances remains unknown. Thus, we investigated gut microbial functions and their associations with AA metabolic alterations in patients with HF. Methods and Results: We performed whole-genome shotgun sequencing of fecal samples and mass spectrometry-based profiling of AAs in patients with compensated HF. Plasma levels of total essential AAs (EAAs) and histidine were significantly lower in patients with HF than in control subjects. HF patients also displayed increased and decreased abundance of gut microbial genes involved in the degradation and biosynthesis, respectively, of EAAs, including branched-chain AAs (BCAAs) and histidine. Importantly, a significant positive correlation was observed between the abundance of microbial genes involved in BCAA biosynthesis and plasma BCAA levels in patients with HF, but not in controls. Moreover, network analysis revealed that the depletion of Eubacterium and Prevotella, which harbor genes for BCAA and histidine biosynthesis, contributed to decreased abundance of microbial genes involved in the biosynthesis of those EAAs in patients with HF. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated the relationship between gut microbiota and AA metabolic disturbances in patients with HF.

## Downregulation of CSF-derived miRNAs miR-142-3p and miR-17-5p may be associated with post-dural puncture headache in pregnant women upon spinal anaesthesia.
 26.09.2021, _D Yücel_


Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) develops due to puncture of the dura mater. The risk factors that influence PDPH incidence are Body Mass Index (BMI), sex, spinal needle type, history of headache, and loss of Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume, yet there is no consensus on these risk factors. The pathophysiology of PDPH is poorly understood. The molecular pathways that may lead to PDPH are unknown. In this study, CSF - derived microRNAs (miRNAs) were investigated for their potential to predispose to PDPH in a population of pregnant women.

## Stability of healthy subgingival microbiome across space and time.
 18.12.2021, _R Tamashiro, L Strange, K Schnackenberg, J Santos, H Gadalla, L Zhao, EC Li, E Hill, B Hill, G Sidhu, M Kirst, C Walker, GP Wang_


The subgingival microbiome is one of the most stable microbial ecosystems in the human body. Alterations in the subgingival microbiome have been associated with periodontal disease, but their variations over time and between different subgingival sites in periodontally healthy individuals have not been well described. We performed extensive, longitudinal sampling of the subgingival microbiome from five periodontally healthy individuals to define baseline spatial and temporal variations. A total of 251 subgingival samples from 5 subjects were collected over 6-12 months and deep sequenced. The overall microbial diversity and composition differed significantly between individuals. Within each individual, we observed considerable differences in microbiome composition between different subgingival sites. However, for a given site, the microbiome was remarkably stable over time, and this stability was associated with increased microbial diversity but was inversely correlated with the enrichment of putative periodontal pathogens. In contrast to microbiome composition, the predicted functional metagenome was similar across space and time, suggesting that periodontal health is associated with shared gene functions encoded by different microbiome consortia that are individualized. To our knowledge, this is one of the most detailed longitudinal analysis of the healthy subgingival microbiome to date that examined the longitudinal variability of different subgingival sites within individuals. These results suggest that a single measurement of the healthy subgingival microbiome at a given site can provide long term information of the microbial composition and functional potential, but sampling of each site is necessary to define the composition and community structure at individual subgingival sites.

## Successional Stages in Infant Gut Microbiota Maturation.
 14.12.2021, _L Beller, W Deboutte, G Falony, S Vieira-Silva, RY Tito, M Valles-Colomer, L Rymenans, D Jansen, L Van Espen, MI Papadaki, C Shi, CK Yinda, M Zeller, K Faust, M Van Ranst, J Raes, J Matthijnssens_


Disturbances in the primary colonization of the infant gut can result in lifelong consequences and have been associated with a range of host conditions. Although early-life factors have been shown to affect infant gut microbiota development, our current understanding of human gut colonization in early life remains limited. To gain more insights into the unique dynamics of this rapidly evolving ecosystem, we investigated the microbiota over the first year of life in eight densely sampled infants (n = 303 total samples). To evaluate the gut microbiota maturation transition toward an adult configuration, we compared the microbiome composition of the infants to that of the Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP) population (n = 1,106). We observed the infant gut microbiota to mature through three distinct, conserved stages of ecosystem development. Across these successional gut microbiota maturation stages, the genus predominance was observed to shift from Escherichia over Bifidobacterium to Bacteroides. Both disease and antibiotic treatment were observed to be associated occasionally with gut microbiota maturation stage regression, a transient setback in microbiota maturation dynamics. Although the studied microbiota trajectories evolved to more adult-like constellations, microbiome community typing against the background of the FGFP cohort clustered all infant samples within the (in adults) potentially dysbiotic Bacteroides 2 (Bact2) enterotype. We confirmed the similarities between infant gut microbial colonization and adult dysbiosis. Profound knowledge about the primary gut colonization process in infants might provide crucial insights into how the secondary colonization of a dysbiotic adult gut can be redirected. IMPORTANCE After birth, microbial colonization of the infant intestinal tract is important for health later in life. However, this initial process is highly dynamic and influenced by many factors. Studying this process in detail requires a dense longitudinal sampling effort. In the current study, the bacterial microbiota of &gt;300 stool samples was analyzed from 8 healthy infants, suggesting that the infant gut microbial population matures along a path involving distinct microbial constellations and that the timing of these transitions is infant specific and can temporarily retrace upon external events. We also showed that the infant microbial populations show similarities to suboptimal bacterial populations in the guts of adults. These insights are crucial for a better understanding of the dynamics and characteristics of a "healthy gut microbial population" in both infants and adults and might allow the identification of intervention targets in cases of microbial disturbances or disease.

## Colonization of gut microbiota by plasmid-carrying bacteria is facilitated by evolutionary adaptation to antibiotic treatment.
 14.12.2021, _P Zhang, D Mao, H Gao, L Zheng, Z Chen, Y Gao, Y Duan, J Guo, Y Luo, H Ren_


Multidrug-resistant plasmid-carrying bacteria are of particular clinical concern as they could transfer antibiotic resistance genes to other bacterial species. However, little is known whether evolutionary adaptation of plasmid-carrying bacteria after long-term antibiotic exposure could affect their subsequent colonization of the human gut. Herein, we combined a long-term evolutionary model based on Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 and the multidrug-resistant plasmid RP4 with in vivo colonization experiments in mice. We found that the evolutionary adaptation of plasmid-carrying bacteria to antibiotic exposure facilitated colonization of the murine gut and subsequent plasmid transfer to gut bacteria. The evolved plasmid-carrying bacteria exhibited phenotypic alterations, including multidrug resistance, enhanced bacterial growth and biofilm formation capability and decreased plasmid fitness cost, which might be jointly caused by chromosomal mutations (SNPs in rpoC, proQ, and hcaT) and transcriptional modifications. The upregulated transcriptional genes, e.g., type 1 fimbrial-protein pilus (fimA and fimH) and the surface adhesin gene (flu) were likely responsible for the enhanced biofilm-forming capacity. The gene tnaA that encodes a tryptophanase-catalyzing indole formation was transcriptionally upregulated, and increased indole products participated in facilitating the maximum population density of the evolved strains. Furthermore, several chromosomal genes encoding efflux pumps (acriflavine resistance proteins A and B (acrA, acrB), outer-membrane protein (tolC), multidrug-resistance protein (mdtM), and macrolide export proteins A and B (macA, macB)) were transcriptionally upregulated, while most plasmid-harboring genes (conjugal transfer protein (traF) and (trbB), replication protein gene (trfA), beta-lactamase TEM precursor (blaTEM), aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase (aphA) and tetracycline resistance protein A (tetA)) were downregulated. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that evolutionary adaptation of plasmid-carrying bacteria in an antibiotic-influenced environment facilitated colonization of the murine gut by the bacteria and plasmids.

## Bacterial vaginosis and health-associated bacteria modulate the immunometabolic landscape in 3D model of human cervix.
 14.12.2021, _P Łaniewski, MM Herbst-Kralovetz_


Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an enigmatic polymicrobial condition characterized by a depletion of health-associated Lactobacillus and an overgrowth of anaerobes. Importantly, BV is linked to adverse gynecologic and obstetric outcomes: an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, preterm birth, and cancer. We hypothesized that members of the cervicovaginal microbiota distinctly contribute to immunometabolic changes in the human cervix, leading to these sequelae. Our 3D epithelial cell model that recapitulates the human cervical epithelium was infected with clinical isolates of cervicovaginal bacteria, alone or as a polymicrobial community. We used Lactobacillus crispatus as a representative health-associated commensal and four common BV-associated species: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Atopobium vaginae, and Sneathia amnii. The immunometabolic profiles of these microenvironments were analyzed using multiplex immunoassays and untargeted global metabolomics. A. vaginae and S. amnii exhibited the highest proinflammatory potential through induction of cytokines, iNOS, and oxidative stress-associated compounds. G. vaginalis, P. bivia, and S. amnii distinctly altered physicochemical barrier-related proteins and metabolites (mucins, sialic acid, polyamines), whereas L. crispatus produced an antimicrobial compound, phenyllactic acid. Alterations to the immunometabolic landscape correlate with symptoms and hallmarks of BV and connected BV with adverse women's health outcomes. Overall, this study demonstrated that 3D cervical epithelial cell colonized with cervicovaginal microbiota faithfully reproduce the immunometabolic microenvironment previously observed in clinical studies and can successfully be used as a robust tool to evaluate host responses to commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the female reproductive tract.

The microbiota of the nasopharyngeal tract (NT) play a role in host immunity against respiratory infectious diseases. However, scant information is available on interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with the nasopharyngeal microbiome. This study characterizes the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human nasopharyngeal microbiomes and their relevant metabolic functions. Twenty-two (n = 22) nasopharyngeal swab samples (including COVID-19 patients = 8, recovered humans = 7, and healthy people = 7) were collected, and underwent to RNAseq-based metagenomic investigation. Our RNAseq data mapped to 2281 bacterial species (including 1477, 919 and 676 in healthy, COVID-19 and recovered metagenomes, respectively) indicating a distinct microbiome dysbiosis. The COVID-19 and recovered samples included 67% and 77% opportunistic bacterial species, respectively compared to healthy controls. Notably, 79% commensal bacterial species found in healthy controls were not detected in COVID-19 and recovered people. Similar dysbiosis was also found in viral and archaeal fraction of the nasopharyngeal microbiomes. We also detected several altered metabolic pathways and functional genes in the progression and pathophysiology of COVID-19. The nasopharyngeal microbiome dysbiosis and their genomic features determined by our RNAseq analyses shed light on early interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with the nasopharyngeal resident microbiota that might be helpful for developing microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for this novel pandemic disease.

## Gut Mycobiota Dysbiosis in Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients Undergoing Anti-Tuberculosis Treatment.
 17.12.2021, _D Cao, W Liu, N Lyu, B Li, W Song, Y Yang, J Zhu, Z Zhang, B Zhu_


Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) undergoing anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) treatment were previously reported to present gut bacterial microbiota dysbiosis, but the role of the mycobiota has not been reported. Here, we conducted a follow-up study of 29 naive TB patients who received first-line anti-TB drug treatment; we collected their fecal samples at different time points, as well as 22 fecal samples from healthy subjects. Fungal ITS2 and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were used to analyze the effects of active TB and anti-TB treatment on the gut microbiota. We found that naive TB patients had bacterial and fungal dysbiosis with altered community composition and a decreased density of the transkingdom correlation network. Anti-TB drug treatment significantly decreased the diversity of bacteria and fungi with altered composition. Notably, we observed that the abundance of Purpureocillium lilacinum tended to decrease and Nakaseomyces spp. tended to increase in the anti-TB treatment, and all of them had increased proportions in the three TB groups compared with healthy subjects. We found that the fungal-bacterial transkingdom network was severely altered in TB patients after 2 months of treatment, and new fungal-enriched connections that were not observed in other groups after 6 months of treatment. This study provides the first detailed analysis of dysbiosis of the gut mycobiota due to active TB and anti-TB treatment. The results suggest that fungi play an important role in the balance of the gut microbiota and may be associated with the progression of TB, influencing the microbiota and immunity homeostasis in those receiving anti-TB treatment. IMPORTANCE Numerous studies have shown that the gut bacterial microbiota is altered in active TB patients and that anti-TB drugs have profound and long-term impacts. However, as an integral part of the microbiota, fungi have rarely been studied. The need to investigate both the bacterial and fungal microbiota, as well as the relationship between them is apparent. The significance of our study is in our examination of the changes in the bacterial and fungal microbiota simultaneously in both active TB and patients receiving anti-TB treatment. We found that fungi play an important role in the bacterial-fungal transkingdom network, especially during the anti-TB therapy. These findings underscore the importance of fungi in gut microbiota dysbiosis during active TB and anti-TB treatment processes. In addition, our findings suggest it is meaningful to research potential adjunctive therapies that reduce fungal expansion and increase commensal bacterial abundance after anti-TB treatment, which would help the recovery of TB patients.

## The Role of Gut Microbiota and Genetic Susceptibility in the Pathogenesis of Pancreatitis.
 15.12.2021, _F Xu, C Yang, M Tang, M Wang, Z Cheng, D Chen, X Chen, K Liu_


Pancreatitis is one of the most common inflammatory diseases of the pancreas caused by autodigestion induced by excessive premature protease activation. However, recognition of novel pathophysiological mechanisms remains a still challenge. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of pancreatitis, and the gut microbiota is a potential source of an environmental effect. In recent years, several new frontiers in gut microbiota and genetic risk assessment research have emerged and improved the understanding of the disease. These investigations showed that the disease progression of pancreatitis could be regulated by the gut microbiome, either through a translocation influence or in a host immune response manner. Meanwhile, the onset of the disease is also associated with the heritage of a pathogenic mutation, and the disease progression could be modified by genetic risk factors. In this review, we focused on the recent advances in the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis, and the genetic susceptibility in pancreatitis.

## Transcript host-RNA signatures to discriminate bacterial and viral infections in febrile children.
 16.12.2021, _D Buonsenso, G Sodero, P Valentini_


Traditional laboratory markers, such as white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, failed to discriminate viral and bacterial infections in children. The lack of an accurate diagnostic test has a negative impact on child's care, limiting the ability of early diagnosis and appropriate management of children. This, on the one hand, may lead to delayed recognition of sepsis and severe bacterial infections, which still represent the leading causes of child morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, this may lead to overuse of empiric antibiotic therapies, particularly for specific subgroups of patients, such as infants younger than 90 days of life or neutropenic patients. This approach has an adverse effect on costs, antibiotic resistance, and pediatric microbiota. Transcript host-RNA signatures are a new tool used to differentiate viral from bacterial infections by analyzing the transcriptional biosignatures of RNA in host leukocytes. In this systematic review, we evaluate the efficacy and the possible application of this new diagnostic method in febrile children, along with challenges in its implementation. Our review support the growing evidence that the application of these new tools can improve the characterization of the spectrum of bacterial and viral infections and optimize the use of antibiotics in children. IMPACT: Transcript host RNA signatures may allow to better characterize the spectrum of viral, bacterial, and inflammatory illnesses in febrile children and can be used with traditional diagnostic methods to determine if and when to start antibiotic therapy. This is the first review on the use of transcript RNA signatures in febrile children to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Our review identified a wide variability of target populations and gold standards used to define sepsis and SBIs, limiting the generalization of our findings.

## The role of anaerobic bacteria in the development and prevention of colorectal cancer: A review study.
 18.12.2021, _M Mohammadi, H Mirzaei, M Motallebi_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer in both males and females in the Unites States. Colonoscopy is considered a safe method for screening this disorder; however, it can be challenging for patients. As research on microbiota, especially anaerobic microbiota, has expanded substantially, new links have been determined between anaerobic bacteria and CRC progression. These associations can be useful in screening CRC in the near future. This review discusses current research investigating the presence of anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Clostridium septicum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Parvimonas micra in CRC and presents an overview about their mechanisms of action. We also discuss the current anaerobic probiotics used for the treatment and prevention of CRC.
