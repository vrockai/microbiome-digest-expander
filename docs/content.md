This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a pervasive perinatal pathogen, yet factors driving GBS dissemination in utero are poorly defined. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a complication marked by dysregulated immunity and maternal microbial dysbiosis, increases risk for GBS perinatal disease. Using a murine GDM model of GBS colonization and perinatal transmission, we find that GDM mice display greater GBS in utero dissemination and subsequently worse neonatal outcomes. Dual-RNA sequencing reveals differential GBS adaptation to the GDM reproductive tract, including a putative glycosyltransferase (yfhO), and altered host responses. GDM immune disruptions include reduced uterine natural killer cell activation, impaired recruitment to placentae, and altered maternofetal cytokines. Lastly, we observe distinct vaginal microbial taxa associated with GDM status and GBS invasive disease status. Here, we show a model of GBS dissemination in GDM hosts that recapitulates several clinical aspects and identifies multiple host and bacterial drivers of GBS perinatal disease.

Novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat the antibiotic-resistance crisis. We present a machine-learning-based approach to predict antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) within the global microbiome and leverage a vast dataset of 63,410 metagenomes and 87,920 prokaryotic genomes from environmental and host-associated habitats to create the AMPSphere, a comprehensive catalog comprising 863,498 non-redundant peptides, few of which match existing databases. AMPSphere provides insights into the evolutionary origins of peptides, including by duplication or gene truncation of longer sequences, and we observed that AMP production varies by habitat. To validate our predictions, we synthesized and tested 100 AMPs against clinically relevant drug-resistant pathogens and human gut commensals both in vitro and in vivo. A total of 79 peptides were active, with 63 targeting pathogens. These active AMPs exhibited antibacterial activity by disrupting bacterial membranes. In conclusion, our approach identified nearly one million prokaryotic AMP sequences, an open-access resource for antibiotic discovery.

The study aimed to assess loneliness experiences among athletes with disabilities (AWD) during the different phases of the pandemic and to understand its relationship with coping styles. Ninety-one AWD participated in a longitudinal study spanning 10 months, covering three time points: April (A), June (Time B), and November (Time C) 2021. The study used the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations and the revised University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale-Revised (UCLA-R) to measure coping mechanisms and feelings of loneliness, respectively. Loneliness levels peaked during the most intense phase of the pandemic, showing significant differences between consecutive time points (χ2 = 20.29, p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.24). The most robust regression models were built in Time B, using the "intimate contacts" dimension of loneliness as the dependent variable and "emotion-oriented coping", "avoidance-oriented coping", and "impairment" as independent variables, explaining 44% of the variance (p &lt; 0.001). Loneliness among Paralympic athletes fluctuated during various phases of the pandemic. The findings highlight the significant influence of coping styles, particularly emotional styles which heightened perceived loneliness, and task-oriented styles which reduced it, on athletes' experiences of loneliness. These results underscore the need for longitudinal studies to delve deeper into the relationship between loneliness and mental health. Moreover, they stress the importance of developing tailored interventions that promote effective coping mechanisms in AWD during challenging times amid to COIVID-19.

## Bioenergetic mapping of 'healthy microbiomes' via compound processing potential imprinted in gut and soil metagenomes.

Despite mounting evidence of their importance in human health and ecosystem functioning, the definition and measurement of 'healthy microbiomes' remain unclear. More advanced knowledge exists on health associations for compounds used or produced by microbes. Environmental microbiome exposures (especially via soils) also help shape, and may supplement, the functional capacity of human microbiomes. Given the synchronous interaction between microbes, their feedstocks, and micro-environments, with functional genes facilitating chemical transformations, our objective was to examine microbiomes in terms of their capacity to process compounds relevant to human health. Here we integrate functional genomics and biochemistry frameworks to derive new quantitative measures of in silico potential for human gut and environmental soil metagenomes to process a panel of major compound classes (e.g., lipids, carbohydrates) and selected biomolecules (e.g., vitamins, short-chain fatty acids) linked to human health. Metagenome functional potential profile data were translated into a universal compound mapping 'landscape' based on bioenergetic van Krevelen mapping of function-level meta-compounds and corresponding functional relative abundances, reflecting imprinted genetic capacity of microbiomes to metabolize an array of different compounds. We show that measures of 'compound processing potential' associated with human health and disease (examining atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes and anxious-depressive behavior case studies), and displayed seemingly predictable shifts along gradients of ecological disturbance in plant-soil ecosystems (three case studies). Ecosystem quality explained 60-92 % of variation in soil metagenome compound processing potential measures in a post-mining restoration case study dataset. With growing knowledge of the varying proficiency of environmental microbiota to process human health associated compounds, we might design environmental interventions or nature prescriptions to modulate our exposures, thereby advancing microbiota-oriented approaches to human health. Compound processing potential offers a simplified, integrative approach for applying metagenomics in ongoing efforts to understand and quantify the role of microbiota in environmental- and human-health.

## Improved Visualization of Oral Microbial Consortia.
 03.06.2024, _ST Ramirez-Puebla, JL Mark Welch, GG Borisy_


Bacteria on the tongue dorsum (TD) form consortia tens to hundreds of microns in diameter organized around a core of epithelial cells. Whole-mount preparations have been instrumental in revealing their organization and specific microbial associations. However, their thickness and intricate 3-dimensional complexity present challenges for a comprehensive spatial analysis. To overcome these challenges, we employed a complementary approach: embedding in hydrophilic plastic followed by sectioning and postsectioning labeling. Samples were labeled by hybridization with multiplexed fluorescent oligonucleotide probes and visualized by spectral imaging and linear unmixing. Application of this strategy to TD biofilms improved the visualization of bacteria that were difficult to resolve in whole-mount imaging. Actinomyces, previously detected as patches, became resolved at the single-cell level. The filamentous taxa Leptotrichia and Lachnospiraceae, located at the core of the consortium, were regularly visualized whereas previously they were rarely detected when using whole mounts. Streptococcus salivarius, heterogeneously detected in whole mounts, were regularly and homogenously observed. Two-dimensional images provide valuable information about the organization of bacterial biofilms. However, they offer only a single plane of view for objects that can extend to hundreds of microns in thickness, and information obtained from such images may not always reflect the complexity of a 3-dimensional object. We combined serial physical sectioning with optical sectioning to facilitate the 3-dimensional reconstruction of consortia, spanning over 100 µm in thickness. Our work showcases the use of hydrophilic plastic embedding and sectioning for examining the structure of TD biofilms through spectral imaging fluorescence in situ hybridization. The result was improved visualization of important members of the human oral microbiome. This technique serves as a complementary method to the previously employed whole-mount analysis, offering its own set of advantages and limitations. Addressing the spatial complexity of bacterial consortia demands a multifaceted approach for a comprehensive and effective analysis.

## Corncob structures in dental plaque reveal microhabitat taxon specificity.

_Bacteria, Biofilms, Dental Plaque, Humans, In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence, Mouth, Streptococcus, Zea mays_
The human mouth is a natural laboratory for studying how bacterial communities differ across habitats. Different bacteria colonize different surfaces in the mouth-teeth, tongue dorsum, and keratinized and non-keratinized epithelia-despite the short physical distance between these habitats and their connection through saliva. We sought to determine whether more tightly defined microhabitats might have more tightly defined sets of resident bacteria. A microhabitat may be characterized, for example, as the space adjacent to a particular species of bacterium. Corncob structures of dental plaque, consisting of coccoid bacteria bound to filaments of Corynebacterium cells, present an opportunity to analyze the community structure of one such well-defined microhabitat within a complex natural biofilm. Here, we investigate by fluorescence in situ hybridization and spectral imaging the composition of the cocci decorating the filaments.

Hypertension disproportionately affects African Americans and is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the relationship of blood pressure (BP) with medial temporal lobe (MTL) dynamic network flexibility (a novel AD biomarker) and cognitive generalization in older African Americans. In a cross-sectional study, 37 normotensive (systolic BP &lt;130 mmHg, 82.5% F, 64.4 ± 4.9 years; 14.3 ± 2.1 years of education) versus 79 hypertensive (systolic BP ≥130 mmHg, 79.5% F, 66.8 ± 4.1 years; 14.0 ± 0.2 years of education) participants were enrolled. All participants completed a 10-min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan to assess MTL dynamic network flexibility and two generalization tasks to assess cognition. Anthropometrics and aerobic fitness (via 6-min walk test) were also determined. There was no difference in BMI (29.7 ± 6.4 vs. 31.9 ± 6.3 kg/m2, p = 0.083) or aerobic fitness (15.5 ± 2.6 vs. 15.1 ± 2.6 mL/kg/min; p = 0.445) between normotensive and hypertensive groups. However, normotensive participants had higher MTL dynamic network flexibility compared to hypertensive participants (0.42 ± 0.23 vs. 0.32 ± 0.25 mL, p = 0.040), and this was associated with higher mean arterial blood pressure (r = -0.21, p = 0.036). Therefore, hypertensive older African Americans demonstrated lower MTL dynamic network flexibility compared to their normotensive counterparts independent of BMI and aerobic fitness. Further studies are required to determine how blood pressure mediates AD risk in African Americans.

## Changes of faecal bacterial communities and microbial fibrolytic activity in horses aged from 6 to 30 years old.

Horse owners and veterinarians report that from the age of 15, their horses can lose body condition and be more susceptible to diseases. Large intestinal microbiome changes may be involved. Indeed, microbiota is crucial for maintaining the condition and health of herbivores by converting fibres into nutrients. This study aimed to compare the faecal microbiome in horses aged from 6 to 30 years old (yo), living in the same environment and consuming the same diet, in order to assess whether the parameters changed linearly with age and whether there was a pivotal age category. Fifty horses were selected from the same environment and distributed across four age categories: 6-10 (n = 12), 11-15 (n = 11), 16-20 (n = 13), and 21-30 (n = 14) yo. All horses had no digestive problems, had teeth suitable for consuming their feed, and were up to date with their vaccination and deworming programmes. After three weeks of constant diet (ad libitum hay and 860 g of concentrate per day), one faecal sample per horse was collected on the same day. The bacterial communities' richness and intra-sample diversity were negatively correlated with age. There was a new distribution of non-beneficial and beneficial taxa, particularly in the 21-30 yo category. Although the faecal concentration of short-chain fatty acids remained stable, the acetate proportion was negatively correlated with age while it was the opposite for the proportions of butyrate, valerate, and iso-valerate. Additionally, the faecal pH was negatively correlated with age. Differences were more pronounced when comparing the 6-10 yo and 21-30 yo categories. The values of the parameters studied became more dispersed from the 16-20 yo category onwards, which appeared as a transitional moment, as it did not differ significantly from the younger and older categories for most of these parameters. Our data suggest that the microbiome changes with age. By highlighting the pivotal age of 16-20, this gives the opportunity to intervene before individuals reach extremes that could lead to pathological conditions.

Microplastics, which are tiny plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter, are widely present in the environment, have become a serious threat to aquatic life and human health, potentially causing ecosystem disorders and health problems. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of microplastics, specifically microplastics-polystyrene (MPs-PS), on the structural integrity, gene expression related to tight junctions, and gut microbiota in mice. A total of 24 Kunming mice aged 30 days were randomly assigned into four groups: control male (CM), control female (CF), PS-exposed male (PSM), and PS-exposed female (PSF)(n = 6). There were significant differences in villus height, width, intestinal surface area, and villus height to crypt depth ratio (V/C) between the PS group and the control group(C) (p &lt;0.05). Gene expression analysis demonstrated the downregulation of Claudin-1, Claudin-2, Claudin-15, and Occludin, in both duodenum and jejunum of the PS group (p &lt; 0.05). Analysis of microbial species using 16S rRNA sequencing indicated decreased diversity in the PSF group, as well as reduced diversity in the PSM group at various taxonomic levels. Beta diversity analysis showed a significant difference in gut microbiota distribution between the PS-exposed and C groups (R2 = 0.113, p&lt;0.01), with this difference being more pronounced among females exposed to MPs-PS. KEGG analysis revealed enrichment of differential microbiota mainly involved in seven signaling pathways, such as nucleotide metabolism(p&lt;0.05). The relative abundance ratio of transcriptional pathways was significantly increased for the PSF group (p&lt;0.01), while excretory system pathways were for PSM group(p&lt;0.05). Overall findings suggest that MPs-PS exhibit a notable sex-dependent impact on mouse gut microbiota, with a stronger effect observed among females; reduced expression of tight junction genes may be associated with dysbiosis, particularly elevated levels of Prevotellaceae.

## Patient satisfaction with pharmacy services among users and non users of community based health insurance scheme at public health facilities in Gamo Zone, South Ethiopia: a comparative cross sectional study.
 07.06.2024, _FT Gulta, T Mulugeta, B Wogayehu, M Mensa_


Patient satisfaction is a crucial humanistic outcome metric in pharmacy services. There was a lack of evidence on patients' satisfaction with pharmacy services in Gamo zone among users and nonusers of the CBHI scheme. Therefore, the aim this study is to compare the level of patient satisfaction with pharmacy services among users and nonusers of community based health insurance scheme at public health facilities in Gamo zone, South Ethiopia.

Mammalian intestine harbors a mass of phages that play important roles in maintaining gut microbial ecosystem and host health. Pig has become a common model for biomedical research and provides a large amount of meat for human consumption. However, the knowledge of gut phages in pigs is still limited.

Prevotella bacteria are associated with inherent diseases of the oral cavity, such as periodontal disease, and systemic diseases. Oral frailty (OF) has been associated with nursing necessity and death. However, the relationship between OF and oral microbiota has not been fully clarified.

## Blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) as potential mechanical vectors of the protozoan cyst and helminthic eggs in Kashmir Himalaya, India.
 07.06.2024, _TA Dar, AH Mir_


Blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) are an important group of non-biting flies that are potential mechanical vectors of protozoan and helminthic pathogens. The present study was carried out to isolate and identify protozoan cysts and helminthic eggs transmitted by blowflies. Surveys were carried out at six different sites, viz., butcher shops, fish markets, garbage piles, water bodies, and open vegetation in the Kashmir Himalaya. The flies were collected with the help of a sweeping net and using day-old beef liver as bait from March 2021 to February 2023. A total of 968 blowflies were collected, out of which 83 were found carrying at least one protozoan cyst and helminthic egg with six identified species of parasites. Garbage piles were recorded with the highest number of positive cases (10.81%), while human habitation had the highest transmission rate (3.3%). Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) was reported to have the highest number of parasitic cysts and ova (one protozoan cyst and three helminthic eggs), while Ascaris lumbricoides and Entamoeba coli were found to be the most abundant parasites reported from the surface of these flies. The number of parasites isolated from the surface of the blowflies was statistically significant (F = 9.073, df = 1, and p = 0.014), indicating a positive association between the number of parasites isolated from blowflies and the collection sites.
