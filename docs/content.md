The Virus-X-Viral Metagenomics for Innovation Value-project was a scientific expedition to explore and exploit uncharted territory of genetic diversity in extreme natural environments such as geothermal hot springs and deep-sea ocean ecosystems. Specifically, the project was set to analyse and exploit viral metagenomes with the ultimate goal of developing new gene products with high innovation value for applications in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical, and the life science sectors. Viral gene pool analysis is also essential to obtain fundamental insight into ecosystem dynamics and to investigate how viruses influence the evolution of microbes and multicellular organisms. The Virus-X Consortium, established in 2016, included experts from eight European countries. The unique approach based on high throughput bioinformatics technologies combined with structural and functional studies resulted in the development of a biodiscovery pipeline of significant capacity and scale. The activities within the Virus-X consortium cover the entire range from bioprospecting and methods development in bioinformatics to protein production and characterisation, with the final goal of translating our results into new products for the bioeconomy. The significant impact the consortium made in all of these areas was possible due to the successful cooperation between expert teams that worked together to solve a complex scientific problem using state-of-the-art technologies as well as developing novel tools to explore the virosphere, widely considered as the last great frontier of life.

## Cultivating Healthy Connections: Exploring and Engineering the Microbial Flow That Shapes Microbiomes.
 05.10.2021, _TJ Wiles_


Our view of the microbial world has undergone a radical transformation over the past decade. For most of the 20th century, medical microbiological research was focused on understanding the virulent nature of disease-causing pathogens. More recently, advances in DNA sequencing methodologies have exposed a wider diversity of microscopic wildlife that associate with our bodies and the environments around us, and the unexpected roles they play in supporting our health. Our expanding view of the microbial world is now motivating therapeutic interventions that are based not just on the elimination of nefarious pathogens but the nurturing of beneficial microbiomes. In this Commentary, I consider how our historically pathogen-based view of host-microbe interactions may be limiting the scope of new and alternative strategies for engineering microbiomes. I suggest that recognizing the therapeutic potential of the ongoing microbial transmission that connects microbiomes could illuminate unexplored opportunities for cultivating healthy host-microbe relationships.

## Presence of distinctive microbiome in the first-pass meconium of newborn infants.
 05.10.2021, _J Turunen, MV Tejesvi, N Paalanne, J Hekkala, O Lindgren, M Kaakinen, T Pokka, A Kaisanlahti, J Reunanen, T Tapiainen_


We critically evaluated the fetal microbiome concept in 44 neonates with placenta, amniotic fluid, and first-pass meconium samples. Placental histology showed no signs of inflammation. Meconium samples were more often bacterial culture positive after vaginal delivery. In next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S gene, before and after removal of extracellular and PCR contaminant DNA, the median number of reads was low in placenta (48) and amniotic fluid (46) and high in meconium samples (14,556 C-section, 24,860 vaginal). In electron microscopy, meconium samples showed extracellular vesicles. Utilizing the analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) against water, meconium samples had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Escherichia-Shigella. Our results did not support the existence of the placenta and amniotic fluid microbiota in healthy pregnancies. The first-pass meconium samples, formed in utero, appeared to harbor a microbiome that may be explained by perinatal colonization or intrauterine colonization via bacterial extracellular vesicles.

## Effects of X-ray, electron beam and gamma irradiation on PE/EVOH/PE multilayer film properties.
 05.10.2021, _N Girard-Perier, M Claeys-Bruno, SRA Marque, N Dupuy, F Gaston, S Dorey_


To increase sterilization capacity, X-ray and e-beam irradiation modalities are more and more attractive for the indutrial sterilization of heathcare products (medical devices and biopharmaceutical goods). However, no study comparing these different techniques are available concerning multi-layer films. Thus, with the PE/EVOH/PE multilayer film as a model, we show that, whatever the modality of irradiation, the thermal properties are not significantly changed as shown by DSC, and, as such, the physical and mechanical properties of this material are also expected to behave similarly. On the other hand, chemical properties such as oxidation ability are strikingly modified, i.e., the same oxidation level for X-ray and γ-irradiation and twice weaker for e-beam irradiation.

## Metabolic modulation of tumours with engineered bacteria for immunotherapy.

The availability of L-arginine in tumours is a key determinant of an efficient anti-tumour T cell response1-4. Consequently, increases of typically low L-arginine concentrations within the tumour may greatly potentiate the anti-tumour responses of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-blocking antibodies5. However, currently no means are available to locally increase intratumoural L-arginine levels. Here we used a synthetic biology approach to develop an engineered probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 strain that colonizes tumours and continuously converts ammonia, a metabolic waste product that accumulates in tumours6, to L-arginine. Colonization of tumours with these bacteria increased intratumoural L-arginine concentrations, increased the number of tumour-infiltrating T cells and had marked synergistic effects with PD-L1 blocking antibodies in the clearance of tumours. The anti-tumour effect of these bacteria was mediated by L-arginine and was dependent on T cells. These results show that engineered microbial therapies enable metabolic modulation of the tumour microenvironment leading to enhanced efficacy of immunotherapies.

## Effects of prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin on gut-derived uremic toxins and disease progression in rats with adenine-induced chronic kidney disease.
 06.10.2021, _E Melekoglu, MA Cetinkaya, SE Kepekci-Tekkeli, O Kul, G Samur_


Recent studies suggest that dysbiosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases gut-derived uremic toxins (GDUT) generation, leads to systemic inflammation, reactive oxygen species generation, and poor prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation on GDUT levels, inflammatory and antioxidant parameters, renal damage, and intestinal barrier function in adenine-induced CKD rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control group (CTL, n = 12) fed with standard diet; and CKD group (n = 16) given adenine (200 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 3-weeks to induce CKD. At the 4th week, CKD rats were subdivided into prebiotic supplementation (5g/kg/day) for four consecutive weeks (CKD-Pre, n = 8). Also, the control group was subdivided into two subgroups; prebiotic supplemented (CTL-Pre, n = 6) and non-supplemented group (CTL, n = 6). Results showed that prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation did not significantly reduce serum indoxyl sulfate (IS) but did significantly reduce serum p-Cresyl sulfate (PCS) (p = 0.002) in CKD rats. Prebiotic supplementation also reduced serum urea (p = 0.008) and interleukin (IL)-6 levels (p = 0.001), ameliorated renal injury, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (p = 0.002) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p = 0.001) in renal tissues of CKD rats. No significant changes were observed in colonic epithelial tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin in the CKD-Pre group. In adenine-induced CKD rats, oligofructose-enriched inulin supplementation resulted in a reduction in serum urea and PCS levels, enhancement of the antioxidant activity in the renal tissues, and retardation of the disease progression.

## Prevalence and Specificity of Chemoreceptor Profiles in Plant-Associated Bacteria.
 21.09.2021, _C Sanchis-López, JP Cerna-Vargas, S Santamaría-Hernando, C Ramos, T Krell, P Rodríguez-Palenzuela, E López-Solanilla, J Huerta-Cepas, JJ Rodríguez-Herva_


Chemosensory pathways are among the most abundant prokaryotic signal transduction systems, allowing bacteria to sense and respond to environmental stimuli. Signaling is typically initiated by the binding of specific molecules to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of chemoreceptor proteins (CRs). Although CRs play a central role in plant-microbiome interactions such as colonization and infection, little is known about their phylogenetic and ecological specificity. Here, we analyzed 82,277 CR sequences from 11,806 representative microbial species covering the whole prokaryotic phylogeny, and we classified them according to their LBD type using a de novo homology clustering method. Through phylogenomic analysis, we identified hundreds of LBDs that are found predominantly in plant-associated bacteria, including several LBDs specific to phytopathogens and plant symbionts. Functional annotation of our catalogue showed that many of the LBD clusters identified might constitute unknown types of LBDs. Moreover, we found that the taxonomic distribution of most LBD types that are specific to plant-associated bacteria is only partially explained by phylogeny, suggesting that lifestyle and niche adaptation are important factors in their selection. Finally, our results show that the profile of LBD types in a given genome is related to the lifestyle specialization, with plant symbionts and phytopathogens showing the highest number of niche-specific LBDs. The LBD catalogue and information on how to profile novel genomes are available at https://github.com/compgenomicslab/CRs. IMPORTANCE Considering the enormous variety of LBDs at sensor proteins, an important question resides in establishing the forces that have driven their evolution and selection. We present here the first clear demonstration that environmental factors play an important role in the selection and evolution of LBDs. We were able to demonstrate the existence of LBD families that are highly enriched in plant-associated bacteria but show a wide phylogenetic spread. These findings offer a number of research opportunities in the field of single transduction, such as the exploration of similar relationships in chemoreceptors of bacteria with a different lifestyle, like those inhabiting or infecting the human intestine. Similarly, our results raise the question whether similar LBD types might be shared by members of different sensor protein families. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive catalogue of CRs classified by their LBD region that includes a large number of putative new LBD types.

## metaGEM: reconstruction of genome scale metabolic models directly from metagenomes.
 06.10.2021, _F Zorrilla, F Buric, KR Patil, A Zelezniak_


Metagenomic analyses of microbial communities have revealed a large degree of interspecies and intraspecies genetic diversity through the reconstruction of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Yet, metabolic modeling efforts mainly rely on reference genomes as the starting point for reconstruction and simulation of genome scale metabolic models (GEMs), neglecting the immense intra- and inter-species diversity present in microbial communities. Here, we present metaGEM (https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/metaGEM), an end-to-end pipeline enabling metabolic modeling of multi-species communities directly from metagenomes. The pipeline automates all steps from the extraction of context-specific prokaryotic GEMs from MAGs to community level flux balance analysis (FBA) simulations. To demonstrate the capabilities of metaGEM, we analyzed 483 samples spanning lab culture, human gut, plant-associated, soil, and ocean metagenomes, reconstructing over 14,000 GEMs. We show that GEMs reconstructed from metagenomes have fully represented metabolism comparable to isolated genomes. We demonstrate that metagenomic GEMs capture intraspecies metabolic diversity and identify potential differences in the progression of type 2 diabetes at the level of gut bacterial metabolic exchanges. Overall, metaGEM enables FBA-ready metabolic model reconstruction directly from metagenomes, provides a resource of metabolic models, and showcases community-level modeling of microbiomes associated with disease conditions allowing generation of mechanistic hypotheses.

## Phasor-based hyperspectral snapshot microscopy allows fast imaging of live, three-dimensional tissues for biomedical applications.
 10.08.2021, _PN Hedde, R Cinco, L Malacrida, A Kamaid, E Gratton_


_Animals, Colon, Hyperspectral Imaging, Imaging, Three-Dimensional, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Microscopy, NIH 3T3 Cells, Organelles, Retina, Zebrafish_
Hyperspectral imaging is highly sought after in many fields including mineralogy and geology, environment and agriculture, astronomy and, importantly, biomedical imaging and biological fluorescence. We developed ultrafast phasor-based hyperspectral snapshot microscopy based on sine/cosine interference filters for biomedical imaging not feasible with conventional hyperspectral detection methods. Current approaches rely on slow spatial or spectral scanning limiting their application in living biological tissues, while faster snapshot methods such as image mapping spectrometry and multispectral interferometry are limited in spatial and/or spectral resolution, are computationally demanding, and imaging devices are very expensive to manufacture. Leveraging light sheet microscopy, phasor-based hyperspectral snapshot microscopy improved imaging speed 10-100 fold which, combined with minimal light exposure and high detection efficiency, enabled hyperspectral metabolic imaging of live, three-dimensional mouse tissues not feasible with other methods. As a fit-free method that does not require any a priori information often unavailable in complex and evolving biological systems, the rule of linear combinations of the phasor could spectrally resolve subtle differences between cell types in the developing zebrafish retina and spectrally separate and track multiple organelles in 3D cultured cells over time. The sine/cosine snapshot method is adaptable to any microscope or imaging device thus making hyperspectral imaging and fit-free analysis based on linear combinations broadly available to researchers and the public.

## Antithrombotic Study and Identification of Metabolites in Leaf Extracts of Chaya [Cnidoscolus aconitifolius (Mill.) I.M. Johnst.].
 07.10.2021, _JP Quintal-Martínez, IG Quintal-Ortiz, LG Alonzo-Salomón, D Muñoz-Rodríguez, MR Segura-Campos_


In Mexico, Cnidoscolus aconitifolius (chaya) has been used to treat cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Because CVD are the number one cause of mortality, chaya use has become a health strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antithrombotic activity and identify the metabolites in the most active extract. Aqueous (Aq), ethanolic (EtOH), acetonic (An), ethyl acetate (AcOEt), diethyl ether (Et2O), and hexanic (Hx) extracts were obtained. Platelet aggregation, phospholipase A2, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and clot lysis were evaluated. Metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). EtOH showed the greatest inhibition of platelet aggregation and phospholipase A2. Ac had the greatest effect on PT and aPTT. AcOEt had the greatest effect on clot lysis. EtOH, with the highest potential, was analyzed by GC-MS; fatty acids and triterpenes were identified. Thus, EtOH showed greater antiplatelet activity and other extracts showed moderate activity. This is a preliminary antithrombotic study. Future research will allow the development of nutraceuticals or functional ingredients for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis.

## Breech Presentation in Twins as a Risk Factor for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip.
 07.10.2021, _EJ Oh, JJ Min, SS Kwon, SB Kim, CW Choi, YH Jung, KJ Oh, JY Park, MS Park_


Identifying risk factors associated with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is essential for early diagnosis and treatment. Breech presentation is a major DDH risk factor, possibly because of crowding of the fetus within the uterus. In multifetal pregnancy, fetuses are generally smaller than singletons, which may obscure the effect of breech presentation on fetal hips. Only a few studies have investigated the occurrence of DDH in multifetal pregnancies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether the breech presentation is a major risk factor of DDH in twin pregnancies.

## The remarkable viral portal vertex: structure and a plausible model for mechanism.
 07.10.2021, _VB Rao, A Fokine, Q Fang_


Many icosahedral viruses including tailed bacteriophages and herpes viruses have a unique portal vertex where a dodecameric protein ring is associated with a fivefold capsid shell. While the peripheral regions of the portal ring are involved in capsid assembly, its central channel is used to transport DNA into and out of capsid during genome packaging and infection. Though the atomic structure of this highly conserved, turbine-shaped, portal is known for nearly two decades, its molecular mechanism remains a mystery. Recent high-resolution in situ structures reveal various conformational states of the portal and the asymmetric interactions between the 12-fold portal and the fivefold capsid. These lead to a valve-like mechanism for this symmetry-mismatched portal vertex that regulates DNA flow through the channel, a critical function for high fidelity assembly of an infectious virion.
