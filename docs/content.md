The gut microbiome has been implicated in a variety of physiological states, but controversy over causality remains unresolved. Here, we performed bidirectional Mendelian randomization analyses on 3,432 Chinese individuals with whole-genome, whole-metagenome, anthropometric and blood metabolic trait data. We identified 58 causal relationships between the gut microbiome and blood metabolites, and replicated 43 of them. Increased relative abundances of fecal Oscillibacter and Alistipes were causally linked to decreased triglyceride concentration. Conversely, blood metabolites such as glutamic acid appeared to decrease fecal Oxalobacter, and members of Proteobacteria were influenced by metabolites such as 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, alanine, glutamate and selenium. Two-sample Mendelian randomization with data from Biobank Japan partly corroborated results with triglyceride and with uric acid, and also provided causal support for published fecal bacterial markers for cancer and cardiovascular diseases. This study illustrates the value of human genetic information to help prioritize gut microbial features for mechanistic and clinical studies.

## Determine independent gut microbiota-diseases association by eliminating the effects of human lifestyle factors.
 04.01.2022, _C Zhu, X Wang, J Li, R Jiang, H Chen, T Chen, Y Yang_


Lifestyle and physiological variables on human disease risk have been revealed to be mediated by gut microbiota. Low concordance between case-control studies for detecting disease-associated microbe existed due to limited sample size and population-wide bias in lifestyle and physiological variables. To infer gut microbiota-disease associations accurately, we propose to build machine learning models by including both human variables and gut microbiota. When the model's performance with both gut microbiota and human variables is better than the model with just human variables, the independent gut microbiota -disease associations will be confirmed. By building models on the American Gut Project dataset, we found that gut microbiota showed distinct association strengths with different diseases. Adding gut microbiota into human variables enhanced the classification performance of IBD significantly; independent associations between occurrence information of gut microbiota and irritable bowel syndrome, C. difficile infection, and unhealthy status were found; adding gut microbiota showed no improvement on models' performance for diabetes, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, cardiovascular disease. Our results suggested that although gut microbiota was reported to be associated with many diseases, a considerable proportion of these associations may be very weak. We proposed a list of microbes as biomarkers to classify IBD and unhealthy status. Further functional investigations of these microbes will improve understanding of the molecular mechanism of human diseases.

## A Comprehensive Review on the Role of the Gut Microbiome in Human Neurological Disorders.
 05.01.2022, _SG Sorboni, HS Moghaddam, R Jafarzadeh-Esfehani, S Soleimanpour_


The human body is full of an extensive number of commensal microbes, consisting of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively termed the human microbiome. The initial acquisition of microbiota occurs from both the external and maternal environments, and the vast majority of them colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These microbial communities play a central role in the maturation and development of the immune system, the central nervous system, and the GIT system and are also responsible for essential metabolic pathways. Various factors, including host genetic predisposition, environmental factors, lifestyle, diet, antibiotic or nonantibiotic drug use, etc., affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Recent publications have highlighted that an imbalance in the gut microflora, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Moreover, characterization of the microbiome-host cross talk pathways provides insight into novel therapeutic strategies. Novel preclinical and clinical research on interventions related to the gut microbiome for treating neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke, hold significant promise. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the potential involvement of the human gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, with a particular emphasis on the potential of microbe-based therapies and/or diagnostic microbial biomarkers. This review also discusses the potential health benefits of the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation in neurological disorders.

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in women, in whom it reaches 20% of the total neoplasia incidence. Most BCs are considered sporadic and a number of factors, including familiarity, age, hormonal cycles and diet, have been reported to be BC risk factors. Also the gut microbiota plays a role in breast cancer development. In fact, its imbalance has been associated to various human diseases including cancer although a consequential cause-effect phenomenon has never been proven.

## Urogenital Microbiota:Potentially Important Determinant of PD-L1 Expression in Male Patients with Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.
 05.01.2022, _C Chen, Z Huang, P Huang, K Li, J Zeng, Y Wen, B Li, J Zhao, P Wu_


Urogenital microbiota may be associated with the recurrence of bladder cancer, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The notion that microbiota can upregulate PD-L1 expression in certain epithelial tumors to promote immune escape has been demonstrated. Thus, we hypothesized that the urogenital microbiota may be involved in the recurrence and progression of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) by upregulating the PD-L1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between urogenital microbial community and PD-L1 expression in male patients with NMIBC.

## Destabilization of the Bacterial Interactome Identifies Nutrient Restriction-Induced Dysbiosis in Insect Guts.
 05.01.2022, _R Marasco, M Fusi, M Callegari, C Jucker, F Mapelli, S Borin, S Savoldelli, D Daffonchio, E Crotti_


Stress-associated dysbiosis of microbiome can have several configurations that, under an energy landscape conceptual framework, can change from one configuration to another due to different alternating selective forces. It has been proposed-according to the Anna Karenina Principle-that in stressed individuals the microbiome are more dispersed (i.e., with a higher within-beta diversity), evidencing the grade of dispersion as indicator of microbiome dysbiosis. We hypothesize that although dysbiosis leads to different microbial communities in terms of beta diversity, these are not necessarily differently dispersed (within-beta diversity), but they form disrupted networks that make them less resilient to stress. To test our hypothesis, we select nutrient restriction (NR) stress that impairs host fitness but does not introduce overt microbiome selectors, such as toxic compounds and pathogens. We fed the polyphagous black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens, with two NR diets and a control full-nutrient (FN) diet. NR diets were dysbiotic because they strongly affected insect growth and development, inducing significant microscale changes in physiochemical conditions of the gut compartments. NR diets established new configurations of the gut microbiome compared to FN-fed guts but with similar dispersion. However, these new configurations driven by the deterministic changes induced by NR diets were reflected in rarefied, less structured, and less connected bacterial interactomes. These results suggested that while the dispersion cannot be considered a consistent indicator of the unhealthy state of dysbiotic microbiomes, the capacity of the community members to maintain network connections and stability can be an indicator of the microbial dysbiotic conditions and their incapacity to sustain the holobiont resilience and host homeostasis. IMPORTANCE Changes in diet play a role in reshaping the gut microbiome in animals, inducing dysbiotic configurations of the associated microbiome. Although studies have reported on the effects of specific nutrient contents on the diet, studies regarding the conditions altering the microbiome configurations and networking in response to diet changes are limited. Our results showed that nutrient poor diets determine dysbiotic states of the host with reduction of insect weight and size, and increase of the times for developmental stage. Moreover, the poor nutrient diets lead to changes in the compositional diversity and network interaction properties of the gut microbial communities. Our study adds a new component to the understanding of the ecological processes associated with dysbiosis, by disentangling consequences of diets on microbiome dysbiosis that is manifested with the disruption of microbiome networking properties rather than changes in microbiome dispersion and beta diversity.

## Characterization of captive and wild 13-lined ground squirrel cecal microbiotas using Illumina-based sequencing.
 04.01.2022, _E Chiang, CL Deblois, HV Carey, G Suen_


Hibernating animals experience extreme changes in diet that make them useful systems for understanding host-microbial symbioses. However, most of our current knowledge about the hibernator gut microbiota is derived from studies using captive animals. Given that there are substantial differences between captive and wild environments, conclusions drawn from studies with captive hibernators may not reflect the gut microbiota's role in the physiology of wild animals. To address this, we used Illumina-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to compare the bacterial cecal microbiotas of captive and wild 13-lined ground squirrels (TLGS) in the summer. As the first study to use Illumina-based technology to compare the microbiotas of an obligate rodent hibernator across the year, we also reported changes in captive TLGS microbiotas in summer, winter, and spring.

## Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses reveal minor-yet-crucial roles of gut microbiome in deep-sea hydrothermal vent snail.
 04.01.2022, _Y Yang, J Sun, C Chen, Y Zhou, CL Van Dover, C Wang, JW Qiu, PY Qian_


Marine animals often exhibit complex symbiotic relationship with gut microbes to attain better use of the available resources. Many animals endemic to deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems host chemoautotrophic bacteria endocellularly, and they are thought to rely entirely on these symbionts for energy and nutrition. Numerous investigations have been conducted on the interdependence between these animal hosts and their chemoautotrophic symbionts. The provannid snail Alviniconcha marisindica from the Indian Ocean hydrothermal vent fields hosts a Campylobacterial endosymbiont in its gill. Unlike many other chemosymbiotic animals, the gut of A. marisindica is reduced but remains functional; yet the contribution of gut microbiomes and their interactions with the host remain poorly characterised.

## Host, microbiome, and complex space: applying population and landscape genetic approaches to gut microbiome research in wild populations.
 04.01.2022, _CE Couch, CW Epps_


In recent years, emerging sequencing technologies and computational tools have driven a tidal wave of research on host-associated microbiomes, particularly the gut microbiome. These studies demonstrate numerous connections between the gut microbiome and vital host functions, primarily in humans, model organisms, and domestic animals. As the adaptive importance of the gut microbiome becomes clearer, interest in studying the gut microbiomes of wild populations has increased, in part due to the potential for discovering conservation applications. The study of wildlife gut microbiomes holds many new challenges and opportunities due to the complex genetic, spatial, and environmental structure of wild host populations, and the potential for these factors to interact with the microbiome. The emerging picture of adaptive coevolution in host-microbiome relationships highlights the importance of understanding microbiome variation in the context of host population genetics and landscape heterogeneity across a wide range of host populations. We propose a conceptual framework for understanding wildlife gut microbiomes in relation to landscape variables and host population genetics, including the potential of approaches derived from landscape genetics. We use this framework to review current research, synthesize important trends, highlight implications for conservation, and recommend future directions for research. Specifically, we focus on how spatial structure and environmental variation interact with host population genetics and microbiome variation in natural populations, and what we can learn from how these patterns of covariation differ depending on host ecological and evolutionary traits.

## Antibiotic resistance and potential bacterial pathogens identified in red deer's faecal DNA.
 04.01.2022, _D Dias, A Cruz, C Fonseca, S Mendo, TS Caetano_


In the last decades, the wildlife-human interface has been increasing due to several anthropogenic factors. Therefore, it is crucial to be aware of the impact of these new dynamics on the health of wild animals and its associated zoonotic disease risks. This study aimed to characterise the faecal microbiota of two populations of red deer (Cervus elaphus) by metabarcoding, with a particular focus on potential human and veterinary pathogens, and to perform an assessment of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) ocorrence. The faecal microbiota of red deer was assessed by metabarcoding using the 16S rRNA marker, and OTUs of the genera Treponema, Yersinia, Clostridium, Mycobacterium and Rickettsia were identified. Two of them affiliated with species more commonly regarded as pathogens (Clostridium piliforme and Yersinia enterocolitica). The quantification of ARGs was performed by quantitative real-time PCR, using a metagenomic approach, and the most abundant genes were found to be blaTEM , sul1, tetracycline resistance genes (tetW, tetO and tetQ) and ermF. From these, tetO and tetW are rank II ARGs, which were recently considered future threats for human health. Our results suggest the need for screening programs for the occurrence of pathogens and ARGs in wildlife and particularly in game species. This article is protected by copyright.

## Contrasting Effects of Local Environmental and Biogeographic Factors on the Composition and Structure of Bacterial Communities in Arid Monospecific Mangrove Soils.
 05.01.2022, _T Thomson, M Fusi, MF Bennett-Smith, N Prinz, E Aylagas, S Carvalho, CE Lovelock, BH Jones, JI Ellis_


Mangrove forests are important biotic sinks of atmospheric CO2 and play an integral role in nutrient-cycling and decontamination of coastal waters, thereby mitigating climatic and anthropogenic stressors. These services are primarily regulated by the activity of the soil microbiome. To understand how environmental changes may affect this vital part of the ecosystem, it is key to understand the patterns that drive microbial community assembly in mangrove forest soils. High-throughput amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA) was applied on samples from arid Avicennia marina forests across different spatial scales from local to regional. Alongside conventional analyses of community ecology, microbial co-occurrence networks were assessed to investigate differences in composition and structure of the bacterial community. The bacterial community composition varied more strongly along an intertidal gradient within each mangrove forest, than between forests in different geographic regions (Australia/Saudi Arabia). In contrast, co-occurrence networks differed primarily between geographic regions, illustrating that the structure of the bacterial community is not necessarily linked to its composition. The local diversity in mangrove forest soils may have important implications for the quantification of biogeochemical processes and is important to consider when planning restoration activities. IMPORTANCE Mangrove ecosystems are increasingly being recognized for their potential to sequester atmospheric carbon, thereby mitigating the effects of anthropogenically driven greenhouse gas emissions. The bacterial community in the soils plays an important role in the breakdown and recycling of carbon and other nutrients. To assess and predict changes in carbon storage, it is important to understand how the bacterial community is shaped by its environment. Here, we compared the bacterial communities of mangrove forests on different spatial scales, from local within-forest to biogeographic comparisons. The bacterial community composition differed more between distinct intertidal zones of the same forest than between forests in distant geographic regions. The calculated network structure of theoretically interacting bacteria, however, differed most between the geographic regions. Our findings highlight the importance of local environmental factors in shaping the microbial soil community in mangroves and highlight a disconnect between community composition and structure in microbial soil assemblages.

_Endophytes, Microbiota, Oryza, Plant Development, Plant Roots, Symbiosis_
Endophytic microbiota mainly includes positive modulator of plant growth, productivity, stress tolerance and ability to control the phytopathogens. Rice endophytes colonize in different parts like roots, shoots, leaves, seeds, flowers, ovules, etc. The diversity and colonization of endophytes depend on several factors like host specificity, environment specificity, chemotaxis, motility, etc. A mutualistic relationship between rice plant and their endophytes improves the host health. Several crucial activities of rice plants are influenced by the presence of endophytes as they endorse plant growth by producing different phytohormones, solubilized minerals, or mitigating various environmental adverse conditions. Endophytes also protect rice plants from various phytopathogen by the production of secondary metabolites, lytic enzymes, antibiotics and induced systemic acquired resistance. Furthermore, the endophytes from rice and major crops are recently been shown useful in environmental waste management and also for the synthesis of green nanoparticles. This study highlights the beneficial interaction between rice plants and their endophytic microbiota with special emphasis on highlighting their application for sustainable agricultural and environmental practices in order to enhance the agro-economy in an eco-friendly manner.

## Spaceflight Virology: What Do We Know about Viral Threats in the Spaceflight Environment?
 04.01.2022, _B Pavletić, K Runzheimer, K Siems, S Koch, M Cortesão, A Ramos-Nascimento, R Moeller_


Viruses constitute a significant part of the human microbiome, so wherever humans go, viruses are brought with them, even on space missions. In this mini review, we focus on the International Space Station (ISS) as the only current human habitat in space that has a diverse range of viral genera that infect microorganisms from bacteria to eukaryotes. Thus, we have reviewed the literature on the physical conditions of space habitats that have an impact on both virus transmissibility and interaction with their host, which include UV radiation, ionizing radiation, humidity, and microgravity. Also, we briefly comment on the practices used on space missions that reduce virus spread, that is, use of antimicrobial surfaces, spacecraft sterilization practices, and air filtration. Finally, we turn our attention to the health threats that viruses pose to space travel. Overall, even though efforts are taken to ensure safe conditions during human space travel, for example, preflight quarantines of astronauts, we reflect on the potential risks humans might be exposed to and how those risks might be aggravated in extraterrestrial habitats.
