Childhood is considered crucial in the establishment of future oral microbiota. However, the precise period of oral microbiota development remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the progression of oral microbiota formation in children. We longitudinally investigated the salivary microbiota of 54 children across 13 time points from 1 wk to 60 mo (5 y) old and their parents at 2 time points as a representative sample of the adult microbiota. Using next-generation sequencing, we obtained 10,000 gene sequences of the 16s rRNA V1-V2 region for each sample. The detection rate in children of 110 operational taxonomic units commonly detected in more than 85% of mothers and fathers, defined as the main constituent bacteria, was 25% at 1 wk old, increased to 80% between 6 and 18 mo old, and reached approximately 90% by 36 mo old. Early main constituent bacteria detected at 1 wk old were limited to Streptococcus, Rothia, and Gemella. At 6 to 18 mo old, the detection rates of various main constituent bacteria, including Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Fusobacterium, increased. UniFrac distance analysis showed that the oral microbiota of children approached that of adults at 6 to 18 mo old. In the weighted UniFrac distance index, unlike the unweighted index, there were no significant changes in children between 36 and 60 mo old from adults, and microbiota formation at 60 mo old was sufficiently advanced to be included within the range of adult individual differences. Our findings suggest that the initial 36 mo, particularly the period from 6 to 18 mo old, consists of a time window for oral microbiota maturation. In addition, the development of microbiota during this period may be critical for future oral disease prevention.

Pre-diagnostic disturbances in the microbiome-derived metabolome have been associated with an increased risk of diabetes in non-pregnant populations. However, the roles of microbiome-derived metabolites, the end-products of microbial metabolism, in gestational diabetes (GDM) remain understudied. We examined the prospective association of microbiome-derived metabolites in early to mid-pregnancy with GDM risk in a diverse population.

Progression of chronic lung disease may lead to the requirement for lung transplant (LTx). Despite improvements in short-term survival after LTx, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains a critical challenge for long-term survival. This study investigates the molecular and microbial relationships between underlying lung disease and the development of CLAD in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from subjects post-LTx, which is crucial for tailoring treatment strategies specific to allograft dysfunctions.

Candida spp. are members of the human mucosal microbiota that can cause opportunistic diseases ranging from superficial infections to life-threatening invasive candidiasis. In humans, the most common infection caused by Candida spp. is vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), which affects &gt;70% of women at least once in their lifetime. Of those women, ∼5%-10% develop recurrent VVC (RVVC). In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the host and fungal factors that contribute to susceptibility to VVC and RVVC. We synthesize key findings that support the notion that disease symptoms are driven by neutrophil-associated dysfunction and immunopathology and describe how antifungal immune mechanisms in the vagina are distinct from other mucosal barrier sites. Finally, we highlight key, unanswered research areas within the field that can help us better understand the immunopathogenesis of this infection and facilitate the development of novel preventive, therapeutic, and/or vaccination strategies to combat these common, poorly understood diseases.

## Balancing act: counteracting adverse drug effects on the microbiome.
 12.10.2024, _J de la Cuesta-Zuluaga, P Müller, L Maier_


The human gut microbiome, a community of microbes that plays a crucial role in our wellbeing, is highly adaptable but also vulnerable to drug treatments. This vulnerability can have serious consequences for the host, for example, increasing susceptibility to infections, immune, metabolic, and cognitive disorders. However, the microbiome's adaptability also provides opportunities to prevent, protect, or even reverse drug-induced damage. Recently, several innovative approaches have emerged aimed at minimizing the collateral damage of drugs on the microbiome. Here, we outline these approaches, discuss their applicability in different treatment scenarios, highlight current challenges, and suggest avenues that may lead to an effective protection of the microbiome.

A recent Nature paper1 reveals that gut microbes metabolize N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) into the bladder carcinogen N-n-butyl-N-(3-carboxypropyl)-nitrosamine (BCPN) in the intestines, establishing a direct link between gut microbial activity and the development of bladder cancer.

Gynecologic cancers develop from the female reproductive organs. Microbial dysbiosis in the gut and oral cavity can communicate with each other through various ways, leading to mucosal destruction, inflammatory response, genomic instability, and ultimately inducing cancer and worsening. Here, we introduce the mechanisms of interactions between gut and oral microbiota and their changes in the development of gynecologic tumors. In addition, new therapeutic approaches based on microbiota modulation are discussed.

## Microbiome-based therapeutics for Parkinson's disease.
 11.10.2024, _AM Hamilton, IN Krout, AC White, TR Sampson_


Recent experimental and clinical data demonstrate a significant dysregulation of the gut microbiome in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). With an immense influence on all aspects of physiology, this dysregulation has potential to directly or indirectly contribute to disease pathology. Experimental models have bridged these associations toward defined contributions, identifying various microbiome-dependent impacts to PD pathology. These studies have laid the foundation for human translation, examining whether certain members of the microbiome and/or whole restoration of the gut microbiome community can provide therapeutic benefit for people living with PD. Here, we review recent and ongoing clinically-focused studies that use microbiome-targeted therapies to limit the severity and progression of PD. Fecal microbiome transplants, prebiotic interventions, and probiotic supplementation are each emerging as viable methodologies to augment the gut microbiome and potentially limit PD symptoms. While still early, the data in the field to date support continued cross-talk between experimental systems and human studies to identify key microbial factors that contribute to PD pathologies.

## Gut bacteria of lepidopteran herbivores facilitate digestion of plant toxins.

Lepidopterans commonly feed on plant material, being the most significant insect herbivores in nature. Despite plant resistance to herbivory, such as producing toxic secondary metabolites, herbivores have developed mechanisms encoded in their genomes to tolerate or detoxify plant defensive compounds. Recent studies also highlight the role of gut microbiota in mediating detoxification in herbivores; however, convincing evidence supporting the significant contribution of gut symbionts is rare in Lepidoptera. Here, we show that the growth of various lepidopteran species was inhibited by a mulberry-derived secondary metabolite, 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ); as expected, the specialist silkworm Bombyx mori grew well, but interestingly, gut microbiota of early-instar silkworms was affected by the DNJ level, and several bacterial species responded positively to enriched DNJ. Among these, a bacterial strain isolated from the silkworm gut (Pseudomonas fulva ZJU1) can degrade and utilize DNJ as the sole energy source, and after inoculation into nonspecialists (e.g., beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua), P. fulva ZJU1 increased host resistance to DNJ and significantly promoted growth. We used genomic and transcriptomic analyses to identify genes potentially involved in DNJ degradation, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis verified the function of ilvB, a key binding protein, in metabolizing DNJ. Furthermore, the ilvB deletion mutant, exhibiting normal bacterial growth, could no longer enhance nonspecialist performance, supporting a role in DNJ degradation in vivo. Therefore, our study demonstrated causality between the gut microbiome and detoxification of plant chemical defense in Lepidoptera, facilitating a mechanistic understanding of host-microbe relationships across this complex, abundant insect group.

Sea cucumbers are predominant deposit feeders in benthic ecosystems, providing protective benefits to coral reefs by reducing disease prevalence. However, how they receive sufficient nutrition from seabed sediments remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate Holothuria leucospilota, an ecologically significant tropical sea cucumber, to elucidate digestive mechanisms underlying marine deposit-feeding. Genomic analysis reveals intriguing evolutionary adaptation characterized by an expansion of digestive carbohydrase genes and a contraction of digestive protease genes, suggesting specialization in digesting microalgae. Developmentally, two pivotal dietary shifts, namely, from endogenous nutrition to planktonic feeding, and from planktonic feeding to deposit feeding, induce changes in digestive tract enzyme profiles, with adults mainly expressing carbohydrases and lipases. A nuanced symbiotic relationship exists between gut microbiota and the host, namely, specific resident bacteria supply crucial enzymes for food digestion, while other bacteria are digested and provide assimilable nutrients. Our study further identifies Holothuroidea lineage-specific lysozymes that are restrictedly expressed in the intestines to support bacterial digestion. Overall, this work advances our knowledge of the evolutionary innovations in the sea cucumber digestive system which enable them to efficiently utilize nutrients from seabed sediments and promote food recycling within marine ecosystems.

The gut microbiome of companion animals is relatively underexplored, despite its relevance to animal health, pet owner health, and basic microbial community biology. Here, we provide the most comprehensive analysis of the canine and feline gut microbiomes to date, incorporating 2639 stool shotgun metagenomes (2272 dog and 367 cat) spanning 14 publicly available datasets (n = 730) and 8 new study populations (n = 1909). These are compared with 238 and 112 baseline human gut metagenomes from the Human Microbiome Project 1-II and a traditionally living Malagasy cohort, respectively, processed in a manner identical to the animal metagenomes. All microbiomes were characterized using reference-based taxonomic and functional profiling, as well as de novo assembly yielding metagenomic assembled genomes clustered into species-level genome bins. Companion animals shared 184 species-level genome bins not found in humans, whereas 198 were found in all three hosts. We applied novel methodology to distinguish strains of these shared organisms either transferred or unique to host species, with phylogenetic patterns suggesting host-specific adaptation of microbial lineages. This corresponded with functional divergence of these lineages by host (e.g., differences in metabolic and antibiotic resistance genes) likely important to companion animal health. This study provides the largest resource to date of companion animal gut metagenomes and greatly contributes to our understanding of the "One Health" concept of a shared microbial environment among humans and companion animals, affecting infectious diseases, immune response, and specific genetic elements.

## Quantitative Synthesis of Microbe-Driven Acclimation and Adaptation in Wild Vertebrates.
 12.10.2024, _G Martin Bideguren, O Razgour, A Alberdi_


Microorganisms associated with animals harbour a unique set of functional traits pivotal for the normal functioning of their hosts. This realisation has led researchers to hypothesise that animal-associated microbial communities may boost the capacity of their hosts to acclimatise and adapt to environmental changes, two eco-evolutionary processes with significant applied relevance. Aiming to assess the importance of microorganisms for wild vertebrate conservation, we conducted a quantitative systematic review to evaluate the scientific evidence for the contribution of gut microorganisms to the acclimation and adaptation capacity of wild vertebrate hosts. After screening 1974 publications, we scrutinised the 109 studies that met the inclusion criteria based on 10 metrics encompassing study design, methodology and reproducibility. We found that the studies published so far were not able to resolve the contribution of gut microorganisms due to insufficient study design and research methods for addressing the hypothesis. Our findings underscore the limited application to date of microbiome knowledge in vertebrate conservation and management, highlighting the need for a paradigm shift in research approaches. Considering these results, we advocate for a shift from observational studies to experimental manipulations, where fitness or related indicators are measured, coupled with an update in molecular techniques used to analyse microbial functions. In addition, closer collaboration with conservation managers and practitioners from the inception of the project is needed to encourage meaningful application of microbiome knowledge in adaptive wildlife conservation management.

Microbial biostalactites and streamers commonly grow at iron seepages in abandoned mines worldwide. This study addresses the diversity and composition of these simple prokaryotic communities, which thrive in pH ranges from 2.4 to 6.6 across six different mines. Our analysis of 85 communities reveals that a pH of approximately 3.2 is a critical threshold where alpha and beta diversity change discretely. Below this pH, the average number of ASVs per sample is 2.91 times lower than above this boundary. Autotrophs, heterotrophs, and symbionts of eukaryotes originate from nearly non-overlapping species pools in the two habitat types that differ only in pH. Communities below pH 3.2 further divide into two distinct groups, differing in diversity, taxonomic, and functional composition. Both types of communities coexist within the same stalactites, likely corresponding to zones where the capillary structure of the stalactite is either perfused or clogged. These findings indicate that microbial community structure can be significantly influenced by the intricate spatial organization of the ecosystem, rather than solely by measurable environmental parameters.

## High accuracy meets high throughput for near full-length 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing on the Nanopore platform.
 11.10.2024, _X Lin, K Waring, H Ghezzi, C Tropini, J Tyson, RM Ziels_


Small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing is a foundational method in microbial ecology. Currently, short-read platforms are commonly employed for high-throughput applications of SSU rRNA amplicon sequencing, but at the cost of poor taxonomic classification due to limited fragment lengths. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform can sequence full-length SSU rRNA genes, but its lower raw-read accuracy has so-far limited accurate taxonomic classification and de novo feature generation. Here, we present a sequencing workflow, termed ssUMI, that combines unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based error correction with newer (R10.4+) ONT chemistry and sample barcoding to enable high throughput near full-length SSU rRNA (e.g. 16S rRNA) amplicon sequencing. The ssUMI workflow generated near full-length 16S rRNA consensus sequences with 99.99% mean accuracy using a minimum subread coverage of 3×, surpassing the accuracy of Illumina short reads. The consensus sequences generated with ssUMI were used to produce error-free de novo sequence features with no false positives with two microbial community standards. In contrast, Nanopore raw reads produced erroneous de novo sequence features, indicating that UMI-based error correction is currently necessary for high-accuracy microbial profiling with R10.4+ ONT sequencing chemistries. We showcase the cost-competitive scalability of the ssUMI workflow by sequencing 87 time-series wastewater samples and 27 human gut samples, obtaining quantitative ecological insights that were missed by short-read amplicon sequencing. ssUMI, therefore, enables accurate and low-cost full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on Nanopore, improving accessibility to high-resolution microbiome science.
