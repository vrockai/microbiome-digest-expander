Metabolomic data processing pipelines have been improving in recent years, allowing for greater feature extraction and identification. Lately, machine learning and robust statistical techniques to control false discoveries are being incorporated into metabolomic data analysis. In this paper, we introduce one such recently developed technique called aggregate knockoff filtering to untargeted metabolomic analysis. When applied to a publicly available dataset, aggregate knockoff filtering combined with typical p-value filtering improves the number of significantly changing metabolites by 25% when compared to conventional untargeted metabolomic data processing. By using this method, features that would normally not be extracted under standard processing would be brought to researchers' attention for further analysis.

## Modeling the temporal dynamics of cervicovaginal microbiota identifies targets that may promote reproductive health.

Cervicovaginal bacterial communities composed of diverse anaerobes with low Lactobacillus abundance are associated with poor reproductive outcomes such as preterm birth, infertility, cervicitis, and risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Women in sub-Saharan Africa have a higher prevalence of these high-risk bacterial communities when compared to Western populations. However, the transition of cervicovaginal communities between high- and low-risk community states over time is not well described in African populations.
