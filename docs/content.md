 17.07.2020, _S Le, A Toussi, N Maverakis, AI Marusina, AA Merleev, G Luxardi, SP Raychaudhuri, E Maverakis_


Psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases of multifactorial etiology. In addition to genetic and environmental factors, evidence supports involvement of a dysregulated human microbiome in the pathogenesis of psoriatic disease. In particular, alterations in the composition of the microbiome, termed dysbiosis, can result in downstream proinflammatory effects in the gut, skin, and joints. Both the cutaneous and intestinal microbial populations are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriatic disease, although exact mechanisms are unclear. Herein, we review the relationship between the human microbiome and psoriatic disease. Further insight into the functions of the microbiome may allow for greater understanding of inflammatory disease processes and identification of additional therapeutic targets.

## A 4-strain Probiotic Supplement Influences Gut Microbiota Composition and Gut Wall Function in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis.
 17.07.2020, _J Ghyselinck, L Verstrepen, F Moens, P Van den Abbeele, J Said, B Smith, I Bjarnason, AW Basit, S Gaisford_


Symprove, a multi-strain probiotic, has been shown to exert a mild anti-inflammatory effect in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). We examined stool samples from 3 patients with UC in order to create microbiotas in an in-vitro gut model. The effects of Symprove on bacterial diversity and metabolic activity in the microbiotas was evaluated over 48h. In addition, the influence of probiotic dosing on epithelial tight-junction integrity, production of inflammatory markers and wound healing were evaluated in cell culture models. The relative proportions of the main bacterial phyla in UC patients differed from those of healthy subjects studied previously; levels of Firmicutes were lowered and levels of Bacteroidetes were raised. Addition of Symprove changed the bacterial composition in the microbiotas over a 48h period. Several other factors generally implicated in good gut health changed after dosing with probiotic; production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lactate was stimulated, levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) increased, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (MCP-1 and IL-8) decreased, epithelial tight junction integrity improved and wound healing occurred faster than a control. The results imply it is not the simple addition of probiotic bacteria that improves gut health. Rather, the probiotic bacteria generate lactate, which then stimulates growth of commensal gut bacteria, raising SCFA levels (particularly butyrate). The increased butyrate concentration positively influences inflammation response and time of wound healing.

## Host Genotype and Colonist Arrival Order Jointly Govern Plant Microbiome Composition and Function.
 17.07.2020, _DR Leopold, PE Busby_


The composition of host-associated microbiomes can have important consequences for host health and fitness [1-3]. Yet we still lack understanding of many fundamental processes that determine microbiome composition [4, 5]. There is mounting evidence that historical contingency during microbiome assembly may overshadow more deterministic processes, such as the selective filters imposed by host traits [6-8]. More specifically, species arrival order has been frequently shown to affect microbiome composition [9-12], a phenomenon known as priority effects [13-15]. However, it is less clear whether priority effects during microbiome assembly are consequential for the host [16] or whether intraspecific variation in host traits can alter the trajectory of microbiome assembly under priority effects. In a greenhouse inoculation experiment using the black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) foliar microbiome, we manipulated host genotype and the colonization order of common foliar fungi. We quantified microbiome assembly outcomes using fungal marker gene sequencing and measured susceptibility of the colonized host to a leaf rust pathogen, Melampsora Ã— columbiana. We found that the effect of species arrival order on microbiome composition, and subsequent disease susceptibility, depended on the host genotype. Additionally, we found that microbiome assembly history can affect host disease susceptibility independent of microbiome composition at the time of pathogen exposure, suggesting that the interactive effects of species arrival order and host genotype can decouple community composition and function. Overall, these results highlight the importance of a key process underlying stochasticity in microbiome assembly while also revealing which hosts are most likely to experience these effects.

## Characterization of gut contractility and microbiota in patients with severe chronic constipation.

Chronic constipation (CC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide. Its pathogenesis, however, remains largely unclear. The purpose of the present work was to gain an insight into the role of contractility and microbiota in the etiology of CC. To this end, we studied spontaneous and evoked contractile activity of descending colon segments from patients that have undergone surgery for refractory forms of CC. The juxta-mucosal microbiota of these colon samples were characterized with culture-based and 16S rRNA sequencing techniques. In patients with CC the spontaneous colonic motility remained unchanged compared to the control group without dysfunction of intestinal motility. Moreover, contractions induced by potassium chloride and carbachol were increased in both circular and longitudinal colonic muscle strips, thus indicating preservation of contractile apparatus and increased sensitivity to cholinergic nerve stimulation in the constipated intestine. In the test group, the gut microbiota composition was assessed as being typically human, with four dominant bacterial phyla, namely Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, as well as usual representation of the most prevalent gut bacterial genera. Yet, significant inter-individual differences were revealed. The phylogenetic diversity of gut microbiota was not affected by age, sex, or colonic anatomy (dolichocolon, megacolon). The abundance of butyrate-producing genera Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Faecalibacterium was low, whereas conventional probiotic genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria were not decreased in the gut microbiomes of the constipated patients. As evidenced by our study, specific microbial biomarkers for constipation state are absent. The results point to a probable role played by the overall gut microbiota at the functional level. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive characterization of CC pathogenesis, finding lack of disruption of motor activity of colonic smooth muscle cells and insufficiency of particular members of gut microbiota usually implicated in CC.

## A high-resolution transcriptome map identifies small RNA regulation of metabolism in the gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
 17.07.2020, _D Ryan, L Jenniches, S Reichardt, L Barquist, AJ Westermann_


Bacteria of the genus Bacteroides are common members of the human intestinal microbiota and important degraders of polysaccharides in the gut. Among them, the species Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has emerged as the model organism for functional microbiota research. Here, we use differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) to generate a single-nucleotide resolution transcriptome map of B. thetaiotaomicron grown under defined laboratory conditions. An online browser, called 'Theta-Base' ( www.helmholtz-hiri.de/en/datasets/bacteroides ), is launched to interrogate the obtained gene expression data and annotations of ~4500 transcription start sites, untranslated regions, operon structures, and 269 noncoding RNA elements. Among the latter is GibS, a conserved, 145 nt-long small RNA that is highly expressed in the presence of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine as sole carbon source. We use computational predictions and experimental data to determine the secondary structure of GibS and identify its target genes. Our results indicate that sensing of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine induces GibS expression, which in turn modifies the transcript levels of metabolic enzymes.

Altered microbiome composition and aberrant promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are two important hallmarks of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we performed concurrent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and methyl-CpG binding domain-based capture sequencing in 33 tissue biopsies (5 normal colonic mucosa tissues, 4 pairs of adenoma and adenoma-adjacent tissues, and 10 pairs of CRC and CRC-adjacent tissues) to identify significant associations between TSG promoter hypermethylation and CRC-associated bacteria, followed by functional validation of the methylation-associated bacteria.

## Vaginal microbiome analysis of healthy women during different periods of gestation.
 17.07.2020, _D Li, XZ Chi, L Zhang, R Chen, JR Cao, XY Sun, HQ Yang, QP Liao_


To assess the vaginal microbiome throughout full-term uncomplicated pregnancy. A longitudinal study was designed for twelve healthy women who had prepared to become pregnant and then delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications. The vaginal microbial community was studied at pre-pregnancy, 8-12, 24-28, 37-38 weeks of gestation, and puerperium, using hypervariable tag sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Sequencing produced approximately 10 million reads on the Illumina MiSeq. Members of the Firmicutes phyla were prevailing before and during pregnancy periods, and the proportion was quite as Proteobacteria until puerperium. Lactobacillus genus was abundant before and during pregnancy, but post-delivery vaginal microflora variety turned diverse. The species-level analysis revealed that a healthy vaginal microbiome before or during pregnancy was prominently dominated by L. crispatus. Furthermore, PCoA analysis revealed for differences in the bacterial community composition between the two levels of Lactobacillus species in pre-pregnancy and pregnancy period (PC1 contribution of 58.46%, PC3 contribution of 8.64%). Based on the taxonomic and PCoA analysis, we found that L. crispatus was dominant in the vagina microflora of healthy women before or during pregnancy, but at the puerperium, the status changed leading to decreased abundance of protective Lactobacillus species that made vaginal micro ecological barrier vulnerable to diseases. Additionally, vaginal pH was important environmental properties affecting the vaginal microbial community.

## The Effect of Gut Microbiome on Carcinogenic DNA Damage.
 17.07.2020, _YC Hsiao, CW Liu, L Chi, Y Yang, K Lu_


The human intestine is host to a vast microbial community, the gut microbiome (GM). The GM has been considered as a key modulator of human health in the past decade. In particular, several studies have supported that altered GM is associated with cancer, such as colorectal cancer, adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic cancer. Formation of DNA adduct is one of the key events in carcinogenesis, and whether GM can influence DNA adducts has yet been examined. This study analyzed 10 DNA adducts, attributed to various endogenous processes and physiological stressors, using highly sensitive LC-MS/MS in germ-free (GF) and conventionally-raised (CONV-R) mice. Our results showed that significant differences in specific DNA adducts appeared in liver, colon, and small intestine samples between GF and CONV-R mice. The differences in adduct levels may indicate that GM can locally or systemically regulate endogenous processes including neutrophil bactericidal activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), oxidative stress generation, and endogenous aldehyde metabolism. Further studies are warranted to elucidate how GM influences endogenous process, DNA damage and the risks of developing cancer.

## Probiotics for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.
 17.07.2020, _BN Limketkai, AK Akobeng, M Gordon, AA Adepoju_


Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, in which the pathogenesis is believed to be partly influenced by the gut microbiome. Probiotics can be used to manipulate the microbiome and have therefore been considered as a potential therapy for CD. There is some evidence that probiotics benefit other gastrointestinal conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome and ulcerative colitis, but their efficacy in CD is unclear. This is the first update of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2008.

## Human milk and mucosa-associated disaccharides impact on cultured infant fecal microbiota.
 17.07.2020, _A Rubio-Del-Campo, C AlcÃ¡ntara, MC Collado, J RodrÃ­guez-DÃ­az, MJ Yebra_


Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a mixture of structurally diverse carbohydrates that contribute to shape a healthy gut microbiota composition. The great diversity of the HMOs structures does not allow the attribution of specific prebiotic characteristics to single milk oligosaccharides. We analyze here the utilization of four disaccharides, lacto-N-biose (LNB), galacto-N-biose (GNB), fucosyl-Î±1,3-GlcNAc (3FN) and fucosyl-Î±1,6-GlcNAc (6FN), that form part of HMOs and glycoprotein structures, by the infant fecal microbiota. LNB significantly increased the total levels of bifidobacteria and the species Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium bifidum. The Lactobacillus genus levels were increased by 3FN fermentation and B. breve by GNB and 3FN. There was a significant reduction of Blautia coccoides group with LNB and 3FN. In addition, 6FN significantly reduced the levels of Enterobacteriaceae family members. Significantly higher concentrations of lactate, formate and acetate were produced in cultures containing either LNB or GNB in comparison with control cultures. Additionally, after fermentation of the oligosaccharides by the fecal microbiota, several Bifidobacterium strains were isolated and identified. The results presented here indicated that each, LNB, GNB and 3FN disaccharide, might have a specific beneficial effect in the infant gut microbiota and they are potential prebiotics for application in infant foods.

Progression of Colorectal cancer (CRC) is influenced by single or compounded environmental factors. Accumulating evidence shows that microbiota can influence the outcome of cancer immunotherapy. T cell, one of the main populations of effector immune cells in antitumor immunity, has been considered as a double-edged sword during the progression of CRC. Our previous studies indicate that traditional Chinese herbs (TCM) have potential anticancer effects in improving quality of life and therapeutic effect. However, little is known about the mechanism of TCM formula in cancer prevention.

## Challenges of Screening Prospective Stool Donors for Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.
 17.07.2020, _NE Dubois, CY Read, K O'Brien, K Ling_


Despite high efficacy rates, significant costs and logistical challenges associated with procuring stool from healthy donors for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have presented barriers to broader institutional adoption and limited the availability of this life-saving treatment. Published outcomes for donor screening programs report donor deferral rates between 90% and 96%. Due to the paucity of FMT donor screening data, a secondary analysis on a cohort of previously screened donors (n = 7,968) was conducted to provide a synopsis of the observed trends and rationales for prospective stool donor deferrals. Upon completion of the evaluation, 1.7% of prospective donors (n = 134) qualified for stool donation. Over 50% of donors who completed the online pre-screen were deferred, primarily for a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater (n = 1,516, 37.0%), logistics (n = 841, 20.5%), and travel history (n = 638, 15.5%). Despite pre-screening, 569 donors (72.8%) who completed the in-person clinical assessment were ultimately deferred due primarily to potentially microbiome-mediated diseases (n = 187, 32.9%). A notably small portion of donors (n = 46, 25.6%) were deferred during the laboratory assessment process suggesting the clinical assessment was effective at deferring donors at higher risk for transmissible diseases. Donors lost to follow-up throughout the screening process presented a significant challenge and contributed to a notable (n = 3,117; 39.1%) portion of donor attrition. Findings were used to support recommendations for improving prospective stool donor screening programs and to provide suggestions for future research.

## Effects of banana powder (Musa acuminata Colla) on the composition of human fecal microbiota and metabolic output using in vitro fermentation.
 17.07.2020, _DD Tian, XQ Xu, Q Peng, YW Zhang, PB Zhang, Y Qiao, B Shi_


Bananas are rich in indigestible carbohydrates and are considered potential whole-fruit prebiotics. To investigate banana-induced changes in the composition of the human gut microbiota and the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), ripe banana (Musa acuminata Colla, Degrees Brix: 22.6 Â± 0.2Â° BÃ©), from Hainan, China, was powdered and fermented in vitro for 24 hr with the feces of six Chinese donors. The degradation of banana polysaccharides was observed in all six fecal samples. During in vitro fecal fermentation, banana polysaccharides were gradually degraded up to approximately 80%. The production of SCFAs was also measured. The addition of banana powder increased the concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate, with the production of acetate being higher than that of propionate and butyrate. Changes in the human gut microbiota were assessed using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The results indicated that banana powder significantly altered bacterial diversity, increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroides, while maintaining the proportion of Bifidobacterium in the feces. At the same time, banana powder also increased the proportion of Lactobacillus; however, a significant difference was not observed. In summary, banana powder can be utilized by specific bacteria in human intestines, providing data support for the study of the effects of banana powder on the human intestinal health. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In this study, in vitro batch fermentation was used to evaluate the effect of banana powder on the human intestinal microbial community, and the metabolized products of banana powder were determined. Our study showed that banana powder improved the human intestinal microbial flora and promoted the growth of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides and could produce beneficial SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). This study provided a theoretical basis for the use of banana powder as a potential prebiotic in production applications and our daily diet.
