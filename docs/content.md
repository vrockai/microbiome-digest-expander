Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (&lt;1500 g) are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes depending on gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), and morbidity in early life. The contribution of the gut microbiome is not well understood. Stool samples were collected weekly in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from 24 VLBW infants for 6 weeks after admission and then again at 2 and 4 years of age. The Battelle Development Inventory-2 Screening Test (BDI-2 ST) was administered at 2- and 4-year time points. VLBW infants had dysbiotic microbiota in the NICU that progressed for most to an adult-type microbiota by 4 years of age. The BDI-2 ST results at age of 2 years triggered referral for further testing in 14 toddlers (70%), and by 4 years of age only seven of these 14 continued to require referral. Both NICU infant stool diversity and particular microbial amplicon sequence variants were associated with BDI-2 ST subscales, particularly for cognition, adaptive, and communication subscales, when controlled for GA, BW, and antibiotic exposure. Network analysis of the NICU infant stool microbial ecology showed differences in children needing neurodevelopmental referral. The results of this preliminary study indicate that the neonatal gut microbiome plays a role in early cognitive and behavioral neurodevelopment.

Heat stress is an important issue in dairy cattle feeding management affecting summer health and economic efficiency. This experiment combined 16S rDNA sequencing(3,864,982 tags, 30 sequencing data), metagenomic sequencing(1,269,441,128 reads, 18 sequencing data), metabolomics analysis(72 sequencing data) and blood index analysis. Ten cows in each animal type (growing heifers, heifers, and lactating cows) were selected for sample collection in April and August. Here, we characterized both the changes in metabolites, rumen microbial communities and their functional potential and the effects of heat stress on serum biochemical, immune, oxidative stress, and hormonal indices derived from rumen fluid and serum samples from cows during different growth stages and in different climates. The generated data expand the resources for the rumen microbiome related to heat stress and age and provide useful datasets for research on developing therapeutic strategies to achieve high summer milk production in cows. These datasets will help researchers study the effects of heat stress on the physiological metabolism of Holstein cows and the time-dependent changes associated with growth stages.

## Microbiomes associated with avian malaria survival differ between susceptible Hawaiian honeycreepers and sympatric malaria-resistant introduced birds.
 25.10.2022, _AK Navine, KL Paxton, EH Paxton, PJ Hart, JT Foster, N McInerney, RC Fleischer, E Videvall_


Of the estimated 55 Hawaiian honeycreepers (subfamily Carduelinae) only 17 species remain, 9 of which the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers endangered. Among the most pressing threats to honeycreeper survival is avian malaria, caused by the introduced blood parasite Plasmodium relictum, which is increasing in distribution in Hawai`i as a result of climate change. Preventing further honeycreeper decline will require innovative conservation strategies that confront malaria from multiple angles. Research on mammals revealed strong connections between gut microbiome composition and malaria susceptibility, illuminating a potential novel approach to malaria control through the manipulation of gut microbiota. One honeycreeper species, Hawai`i `amakihi (Chlorodrepanis virens), persists in areas of high malaria prevalence, indicating they have acquired some level of immunity. To investigate if avian host-specific microbes may be associated with malaria survival, we characterized cloacal microbiomes and malaria infection for 174 `amakihi and 172 malaria-resistant warbling white-eyes (Zosterops japonicus) from Hawai`i Island using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding and qPCR. Neither microbial alpha nor beta diversity covaried with infection, but 149 microbes showed positive associations with malaria survivors. Among these were Escherichia and Lactobacillus spp., which appear to mitigate malaria severity in mammalian hosts, revealing promising candidates for future probiotic research for augmenting malaria immunity in sensitive endangered species.

## Dietary Lactobacillus reuteri prevent from inflammation mediated apoptosis of liver via improving intestinal microbiota and bile acid metabolism.
 25.10.2022, _Z Lin, J Wu, J Wang, CL Levesque, X Ma_


Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) has been recognized as a probiotic to improve liver health, whereas the mechanism behind is still unknown. Herein, mice were gavaged with a strain of L. reuteri named SLZX19-12, which was isolated from faeces of healthy Tibetan pigs in our lab to investigate its effects on liver function. The results demonstrated that dietary L. reuteri changed the constituents of bile acid pool, especially influenced on metabolism of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). In addition, L. reuteri reduced content of cholestasis-associated microbiota and effectively prevented liver from inflammatory response and hepatocyte apoptosis under the acute stimulation from LPS. We further revealed UDCA played an important part in protection of liver health during the stimulation of inflammatory factors in vitro. This study provides theoretical support and novel mechanism of action of L. reuteri protects liver from injury and influences on host physical health via regulation of crosstalk between bile acids and gut microbiota.

Process and function that underlie the assembly of a rhizosphere microbial community may be strongly linked to the maintenance of plant health. However, their assembly processes and functional changes in the deterioration of soilborne disease remain unclear. Here, we investigated features of rhizosphere microbiomes related to Fusarium wilt disease and assessed their assembly by comparison pair of diseased/healthy sequencing data. The untargeted metabolomics was employed to explore potential community assembly drivers, and shotgun metagenome sequencing was used to reveal the mechanisms of metabolite-mediated process after soil conditioning.

_Microbiota, Bacteria, Cell Wall, Biomass, Cellulose_
Plant cell walls are interwoven structures recalcitrant to degradation. Native and adapted microbiomes can be particularly effective at plant cell wall deconstruction. Although most understanding of biological cell wall deconstruction has been obtained from isolates, cultivated microbiomes that break down cell walls have emerged as new sources for biotechnologically relevant microbes and enzymes. These microbiomes provide a unique resource to identify key interacting functional microbial groups and to guide the design of specialized synthetic microbial communities.

## Community assembly patterns and processes of microbiome responses to habitats and Mytilopsis sallei invasion in the tidal zones of the Pearl River Estuary.
 24.10.2022, _Y Guo, A Zhang, C Qin, G Yu, H Ma_


The sustainability of estuarine ecosystem functions depends on the stabilization of microbial ecological processes. However, due to the unique and variable habitat characteristics of estuarine areas, in-depth studies on ecological processes such as the spatial distribution and assembly patterns of microbial community structure are lacking. As methods to elucidate this structure, we used 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA and ITS sequencing technologies to study the composition, diversity, spatial pattern and aggregation mechanism of the bacterial, protist and fungal communities in the tidal zones of the Pearl River Estuary (PRETZ). The abundance of bacterial communities was much higher than that of protists and fungi, and the spatial pattern was obvious in PRETZ. The application of neutral and null models revealed the assembly process of three microbial communities dominated by stochastic processes. Among the stochastic processes, undominated processes (64.03 %, 62.45 %, and 59.29 %) were the most critical processes in the assembly of bacterial, fungal and protist communities. Meanwhile, environmental variables, geographic locations, and biological factors were associated with the composition and assembly of bacterial, protist, and fungal communities. Among the environmental variables, dissolved oxygen and salinity were the main predictors that jointly affected the differences in the community structure of the three microorganisms, and geographic location was the second predictor affecting the community structure of the three microorganisms and had a more pronounced effect on the diversity and network structure of the bacterial and fungal communities. However, biological factors exerted a weaker effect on the microbial community structure than spatial factors and only affected bacteria and protists; the invasive species Mytilopsis sallei only affected the process of protist community assembly. In addition, environmental variables affected the relative importance of stochastic processes. In summary, the formation of microbial communities in the PRETZ was affected by random processes, environmental variables, geographic location, and invasive species.

Amplicon sequencing is an established and cost-efficient method for profiling microbiomes. However, many available tools to process this data require both bioinformatics skills and high computational power to process big datasets. Furthermore, there are only few tools that allow for long read amplicon data analysis. To bridge this gap, we developed the LotuS2 (less OTU scripts 2) pipeline, enabling user-friendly, resource friendly, and versatile analysis of raw amplicon sequences.
