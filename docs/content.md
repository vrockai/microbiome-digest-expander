This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Lactobacillus reuteri inhibits Staphylococcus aureus-induced mastitis by regulating oxytocin releasing and gut microbiota in mice.
 10.01.2024, _Z He, W Li, W Yuan, Y He, J Xu, C Yuan, C Zhao, N Zhang, Y Fu, X Hu_


Mastitis is the most frequent disease of cows and has well-recognized detrimental effects on animal wellbeing and dairy farm profitability. With the advent of the postantibiotic era, alternative antibiotic agents, especially probiotics, have received increasing attention in the treatment of mastitis. Based on research showing that Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) has anti-inflammatory effects, this study explored the protective effects and mechanisms of L. reuteri against mastitis induced by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in mice. First, mice with S. aureus-induced mastitis were orally administered L. reuteri, and the inflammatory response in the mammary gland was observed. The results showed that L. reuteri significantly inhibited S. aureus-induced mastitis. Moreover, the concentration of oxytocin (OT) and protein expression of oxytocin receptor (OTR) were measured, and inhibition of OTR or vagotomy reversed the protective effect of L. reuteri or its culture supernatant (LCS) on S. aureus-induced mastitis. In addition, in mouse mammary epithelial cells (MMECs), OT inhibited the inflammation induced by S. aureus by inhibiting the protein expression of OTR. It was suggested that L. reuteri protected against S. aureus-induced mastitis by releasing OT. Furthermore, microbiological analysis showed that the composition of the microbiota was altered, and the relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly increased in gut and mammary gland after treatment with L. reuteri or LCS. In conclusion, our study found the L. reuteri inhibited the mastitis-induced by S. aureus via promoting the release of OT, and treatment with L. reuteri increased the abundance of Lactobacillus in both gut and mammary gland.

Metabolism of haem by-products such as bilirubin by humans and their gut microbiota is essential to human health, as excess serum bilirubin can cause jaundice and even neurological damage. The bacterial enzymes that reduce bilirubin to urobilinogen, a key step in this pathway, have remained unidentified. Here we used biochemical analyses and comparative genomics to identify BilR as a gut-microbiota-derived bilirubin reductase that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen. We delineated the BilR sequences from similar reductases through the identification of key residues critical for bilirubin reduction and found that BilR is predominantly encoded by Firmicutes species. Analysis of human gut metagenomes revealed that BilR is nearly ubiquitous in healthy adults, but prevalence is decreased in neonates and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. This discovery sheds light on the role of the gut microbiome in bilirubin metabolism and highlights the significance of the gut-liver axis in maintaining bilirubin homeostasis.

Establishing the infant's gut microbiota has long-term implications on health and immunity. Breastfeeding is recognized as the best practice of infant nutrition in comparison with formula feeding. We evaluated the effects of the primary feeding practices by analyzing the infant growth and the potential association with gut diseases. A cross-sectional and observational study was designed. This study included 55 mothers with infants, who were divided according to their feeding practices in breastfeeding (BF), formula feeding (FF), and combined breast and formula feeding (CF). Anthropometric measurements of the participants were recorded. Additionally, non-invasive fecal samples from the infants were collected to analyze the microbiota by sequencing, immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration (ELISA), and volatile organic compounds (gas chromatography with an electronic nose). Results showed that the microbiota diversity in the BF group was the highest compared to the other two groups. The IgA levels in the BF group were twice as high as those in the FF group. Moreover, the child´s growth in the BF group showed the best infant development when the data were compared at birth to the recollection time, as noted by the correlation with a decreased concentration of toxic volatile organic compounds. Interestingly, the CF group showed a significant difference in health status when the data were compared with the FF group. We conclude that early health practices influence children's growth, which is relevant to further research about how those infants' health evolved.

Aquaculture plays an important role in global protein supplies and food security. The ban on antibiotics as feed additive proposes urgent need to develop alternatives. Gut microbiota plays important roles in the metabolism and immunity of fish and has the potential to give rise to novel solutions for challenges confronted by fish culture. However, our understanding of fish gut microbiome is still lacking.

The observation that the intestinal microbiota is central in the development of IBD suggests that dietary fiber, the microbiota's primary source of nourishment, could play a central role in these diseases. Accordingly, enriching diets with specific soluble fibers remodels microbiota and modulates colitis sensitivity. In humans, a recent study suggests that the microbiota of select IBD patients might influence the impacts they would experience upon fiber exposure. We sought here to define the extent to which individual microbiotas varied in their responsiveness to purified soluble fiber inulin and psyllium. Moreover, the extent to which such variance might impact proneness to colitis.

The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.

## Spinal cord abnormal autophagy and mitochondria energy metabolism are modified by swim training in SOD1-G93A mice.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may result from the dysfunctions of various mechanisms such as protein accumulation, mitophagy, and biogenesis of mitochondria. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the molecular mechanisms in ALS development and the impact of swim training on these processes. In the present study, an animal model of ALS, SOD1-G93A mice, was used with the wild-type mice as controls. Mice swam five times per week for 30 min. Mice were analyzed before ALS onset (70 days old), at ALS 1 disease onset (116 days old), and at the terminal stage of the disease ALS (130 days old), and compared with the corresponding ALS untrained groups and normalized to the wild-type group. Enzyme activity and protein content were analyzed in the spinal cord homogenates. The results show autophagy disruptions causing accumulation of p62 accompanied by low PGC-1α and IGF-1 content in the spinal cord of SOD1-G93A mice. Swim training triggered a neuroprotective effect, attenuation of NF-l degradation, less accumulated p62, and lower autophagy initiation. The IGF-1 pathway induces pathophysiological adaptation to maintain energy demands through anaerobic metabolism and mitochondrial protection. KEY MESSAGES: The increased protein content of p62 in the spinal cord of SOD1-G93A mice suggests that autophagic clearance and transportation are disrupted. Swim training attenuates neurofilament light destruction in the spinal cord of SOD1-G93A mice. Swim training reducing OGDH provokes suppression of ATP-consuming anabolic pathways. Swim training induces energy metabolic changes and mitochondria protection through the IGF-1 signaling pathway.

Nanodecoy systems based on analogues of viral cellular receptors assembled onto fluid lipid-based membranes of nano/extravescicles are potential new tools to complement classic therapeutic or preventive antiviral approaches. The need for lipid-based membranes for transmembrane receptor anchorage may pose technical challenges along industrial translation, calling for alternative geometries for receptor multimerization. Here we developed a semisynthetic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanodecoy by multimerizing the biotin labelled virus cell receptor -ACE2- ectodomain onto a poly-avidin nanoparticle (NP) based on the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly-ANANAS. The ability of the assembly to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and the affinity of the ACE2:viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction were measured at different ACE2:NP ratios. At ACE2:NP = 30, 90 % SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition at ACE2 nanomolar concentration was registered on both Wuhan and Omicron variants, with ten-fold higher potency than the monomeric protein. Lower and higher ACE2 densities were less efficient suggesting that functional recognition between multi-ligand NPs and multi-receptor virus surfaces requires optimal geometrical relationships. In vivo studies in mice showed that the biodistribution and safety profiles of the nanodecoy are potentially suitable for preventing viral infection upon nasal instillation. Viral receptor multimerization using ANANAS is a convenient process which, in principle, could be rapidly adapted to counteract also other viral infections.

The rhizosheath, a cohesive soil layer firmly adhering to plant roots, plays a vital role in facilitating water and mineral uptake. In pearl millet, rhizosheath formation is genetically controlled and influenced by root exudates. Here, we investigated the impact of root exudates on the microbiota composition, interactions, and assembly processes, and rhizosheath structure in pearl millet using four distinct lines with contrasting soil aggregation abilities.

## mEnrich-seq: methylation-guided enrichment sequencing of bacterial taxa of interest from microbiome.
 04.01.2024, _L Cao, Y Kong, Y Fan, M Ni, A Tourancheau, M Ksiezarek, EA Mead, T Koo, M Gitman, XS Zhang, G Fang_


Metagenomics has enabled the comprehensive study of microbiomes. However, many applications would benefit from a method that sequences specific bacterial taxa of interest, but not most background taxa. We developed mEnrich-seq (in which 'm' stands for methylation and seq for sequencing) for enriching taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self versus nonself differentiation by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, individually or in combination, to deplete host and background taxa while enriching targeted taxa. This idea is integrated with library preparation procedures and applied in several applications to enrich (up to 117-fold) pathogenic or beneficial bacteria from human urine and fecal samples, including species that are hard to culture or of low abundance. We assessed 4,601 bacterial strains with mapped methylomes so far and showed broad applicability of mEnrich-seq. mEnrich-seq provides microbiome researchers with a versatile and cost-effective approach for selective sequencing of diverse taxa of interest.

## Host genetic determinants drive compartment-specific assembly of tea plant microbiomes.

_Soil Microbiology, Camellia sinensis, Genome-Wide Association Study, Bacteria, Plant Roots, Microbiota, Tea_
Diverse host factors drive microbial variation in plant-associated environments, whereas their genetic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. To address this, we coupled the analyses of plant genetics and microbiomes in this study. Using 100 tea plant (Camellia sinensis) cultivars, the microbiomes of rhizosphere, root endosphere and phyllosphere showed clear compartment-specific assembly, whereas the subpopulation differentiation of tea cultivars exhibited small effects on microbial variation in each compartment. Through microbiome genome-wide association studies, we examined the interactions between tea genetic loci and microbial variation. Notably, genes related to the cell wall and carbon catabolism were heavily linked to root endosphere microbial composition, whereas genes related to the metabolism of metal ions and small organic molecules were overrepresented in association with rhizosphere microbial composition. Moreover, a set of tea genetic variants, including the cytoskeleton-related formin homology interacting protein 1 gene, were strongly associated with the β-diversity of phyllosphere microbiomes, implying their interactions with the overall structure of microbial communities. Our results create a catalogue of tea genetic determinants interacting with microbiomes and reveal the compartment-specific microbiome assembly driven by host genetics.

Background To assess the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) screening, staging, and management in a single health care system. Materials and Methods From November 2015 to December 2020, a total of 1,547 NSCLC cases was reported at our institution including 1,329 cases pre-COVID-19 and 218 cases during COVID-19. Pre-COVID-19 was defined as November 2015 to February 2020, while during COVID-19 was March 2020 to December 2020. Data were collected from tumor registry and medical record review. Patients with mesothelioma, lymphoma, small cell, or mixed small cell cancer were excluded from the study. Results Both pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 cohorts had similar comorbidities including age (70 vs. 71 years), current smokers (35 vs. 32%), and chronic obstructive lung disease (32 vs. 28%). The number of low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening scans decreased by 25% during COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 era. There were more cases of stage 1A NSCLC pre-COVID-19 (31 vs. 25%) and more stage 4 cancer during COVID-19 (42 vs. 33%); p = 0.01. The proportion of patients treated with radiotherapy was similar between pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 (49 vs. 50%), but fewer patients underwent surgery during COVID-19 (17 vs. 27%; p = 0.004). The median time to radiotherapy (67 days) and surgery (29 days) was similar between the groups. The unadjusted overall 6-month mortality after lung cancer diagnoses was higher during COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 (28 vs. 22%; p = 0.04). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in delayed lung cancer screening scans, and more patients had diagnosis of advanced NSCLC; however, short-term mortality was unchanged.
