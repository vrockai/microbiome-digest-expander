This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Host-microbiota interactions play a crucial role in oyster adaptation to rising seawater temperature in summer.
 30.11.2022, _M Liu, Q Li, L Tan, L Wang, F Wu, L Li, G Zhang_

Climate change, represented by rising and fluctuating temperature, induces systematic changes in marine organisms and in their bacterial symbionts. However, the role of host-microbiota interactions in the host's response to rising temperature and the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood in marine organisms. Here, the symbiotic intestinal microbiota and transcriptional responses between diploid and triploid oysters that displayed susceptible and resistant performance under the stress of rising temperature during a summer mortality event were compared to investigate the host-microbiota interactions. The rising and fluctuating temperatures triggered an earlier onset and higher mortality in susceptible oysters (46.7%) than in resistant oysters (17.3%). Correlation analysis between microbial properties and environmental factors showed temperature was strongly correlated with indices of α-diversity and the abundance of top 10 phyla, indicating that temperature significantly shaped the intestinal microbiota of oysters. The microbiota structure of resistant oysters exhibited more rapid changes in composition and diversity compared to susceptible oysters before peak mortality, indicating that resistant oysters possessed a stronger ability to regulate their symbiotic microbiota. Meanwhile, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LefSe) analysis found that the probiotics Verrucomicrobiales and Clostridiales were highly enriched in resistant oysters, and that potential pathogens Betaproteobacteriales and Acidobacteriales were enriched in susceptible oysters. These results implied that the symbiotic microbiota played a significant role in the oysters' adaptation to rising temperature. Accompanying the decrease in unfavorable bacteria before peak mortality, genes related to phagocytosis and lysozymes were upregulated and the xenobiotics elimination pathway was exclusively expressed in resistant oysters, demonstrating the validity of these immunological functions in controlling proliferation of pathogens driven by rising temperature. Compromised immunological functions might lead to proliferation of pathogens in susceptible oysters. This study might uncover a conserved mechanism of adaptation to rising temperature in marine invertebrates from the perspective of interactions between host and symbiotic microbiota.

Although edaphic antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) pose serious threats to human well-being, their spatially explicit patterns and responses to environmental constraints at the global scale are not well understood. This knowledge gap is hindering the global action plan on antibiotic resistance launched by the World Health Organization. Here, a global analysis of 1088 soil metagenomic samples detected 558 ARGs in soils, where ARG abundance in agricultural habitats was higher than that in nonagricultural habitats. Soil ARGs were mostly carried by clinical pathogens and gut microbes that mediated the control of climatic and anthropogenic factors to ARGs. We generated a global map of soil ARG abundance, where the identified microbial hosts, agricultural activities, and anthropogenic factors explained ARG hot spots in India, East Asia, Western Europe, and the United States. Our results highlight health threats from soil clinical pathogens carrying ARGs and determine regions prioritized to control soil antibiotic resistance worldwide.

## Wastewater-based surveillance in Italy leading to the first detection of mcr-10-positive Klebsiella quasipneumoniae.

Wastewater-based surveillance enabled the first detection of the mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-10 in Italy. This plasmid-borne resistance gene was found in strains of Klebsiella quasipneumoniae isolated from samples of human raw sewage collected over several months. Although the isolates were phenotypically susceptible to colistin, the emergence of mcr-10 is concerning due to the highly variable expression of the gene and the potential for horizontal transfer to other species. In addition, the strains also carried an extended-spectrum β-lactamase gene and were phenotypically resistant to several beta-lactams. This study highlights the value of wastewater-based surveillance as an effective tool to monitor the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in strains circulating in the community and the environment.

## A comprehensive study of the source, occurrence, and spatio-seasonal dynamics of 12 target antibiotics and their potential risks in a cold semi-arid catchment.
 09.12.2022, _H Ju, L Liu, X Liu, Y Wu, L Li, KY Gin, G Zhang, J Zhang_


Antibiotics are widely consumed and are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems, such as in agricultural and fishery lake catchments, for prophylactic treatment. However, there are very few comprehensive studies reporting all seasonal occurrences, spatiotemporal dynamics, and risk assessments of antibiotics in agricultural lake catchments, especially in cold regions during the winter season. This study measured seasonality in the concentrations of 12 antibiotics belonging to seven different classes in the surface waters (tributary rivers and lakes) of the Chagan lake catchment in northeast China. All antibiotics were detected in most of the water samples across most seasons, with concentrations varying for different compounds, locations, and seasons. These levels were discussed in terms of the main sources at different sampling sites, including agriculture, fish farming, municipal wastewater, and others. In general, the highest concentrations of most compounds were observed during the freeze-thaw periods. The number of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) correlated with compound lipophilicity and half-life. Based on the ecological risks of antibiotics and the relative abundance of ARGs, a hierarchical control priority list (HCPL) of antibiotics was determined, considering four levels (critical, high, medium, and low). To further strengthen the control and effectively manage antibiotics, we highly recommend the reduction and selective use of veterinary antibiotics in winter and spring during the freeze-thaw periods in the Chagan lake catchment.

## Effects of dog ownership on the gut microbiota of elderly owners.
 08.12.2022, _C Jiang, Z Cui, P Fan, G Du_


Dog owners are usually in close contact with dogs. Whether dogs can affect the gut microbiota of elderly dog owners is worth studying. Data from 54 elderly (over 65 years of age) dog owners were screened from the American Gut Project. Owning a dog did not affect the α-diversity of the gut microbiota of the dog owner. Dog ownership significantly modulated the composition of the gut microbiota of the dog owner. The abundance of Actinobacteria was significantly increased. The abundances of Bifidobacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae were significantly increased, while the abundance of Moracellaceae was significantly suppressed. In general, dog ownership can regulate the composition of gut microbiota and has a more significant effect on elderly males.

Depression is one of the most poorly understood diseases due to its elusive pathogenesis. There is an urgency to identify molecular and biological mechanisms underlying depression and the gut microbiome is a novel area of interest. Here we investigate the relation of fecal microbiome diversity and composition with depressive symptoms in 1,054 participants from the Rotterdam Study cohort and validate these findings in the Amsterdam HELIUS cohort in 1,539 subjects. We identify association of thirteen microbial taxa, including genera Eggerthella, Subdoligranulum, Coprococcus, Sellimonas, Lachnoclostridium, Hungatella, Ruminococcaceae (UCG002, UCG003 and UCG005), LachnospiraceaeUCG001, Eubacterium ventriosum and Ruminococcusgauvreauiigroup, and family Ruminococcaceae with depressive symptoms. These bacteria are known to be involved in the synthesis of glutamate, butyrate, serotonin and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), which are key neurotransmitters for depression. Our study suggests that the gut microbiome composition may play a key role in depression.

## Gut Microbiome and Its Impact on Obesity and Obesity-Related Disorders.
 05.12.2022, _S Sankararaman, K Noriega, S Velayuthan, T Sferra, R Martindale_


The prevalence of overweight and obesity has been increasing worldwide at an alarming rate. Gut microbiota intimately influence host energy metabolism, and immune response. Studies indicate a prominent role of gut dysbiosis in propagating inflammation that is associated with the development of obesity and obesity-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This article will review the current literature on gut microbiome and its impact on obesity and obesity-related disorders.

## The microbiome's fiber degradation profile and its relationship with the host diet.
 07.12.2022, _Y Cohen, E Borenstein_

The relationship between the gut microbiome and diet has been the focus of numerous recent studies. Such studies aim to characterize the impact of diet on the composition of the microbiome, as well as the microbiome's ability to utilize various compounds in the diet and produce metabolites that may be beneficial for the host. Consumption of dietary fibers (DFs)-polysaccharides that cannot be broken down by the host's endogenous enzymes and are degraded primarily by members of the microbiome-is known to have a profound effect on the microbiome. Yet, a comprehensive characterization of microbiome compositional and functional shifts in response to the consumption of specific DFs is still lacking.

## Development of a live biotherapeutic throat spray with lactobacilli targeting respiratory viral infections.

Respiratory viruses such as influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and coronaviruses initiate infection at the mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract (URT), where the resident respiratory microbiome has an important gatekeeper function. In contrast to gut-targeting administration of beneficial bacteria against respiratory viral disease, topical URT administration of probiotics is currently underexplored, especially for the prevention and/or treatment of viral infections. Here, we report the formulation of a throat spray with live lactobacilli exhibiting several in vitro mechanisms of action against respiratory viral infections, including induction of interferon regulatory pathways and direct inhibition of respiratory viruses. Rational selection of Lactobacillaceae strains was based on previously documented beneficial properties, up-scaling and industrial production characteristics, clinical safety parameters, and potential antiviral and immunostimulatory efficacy in the URT demonstrated in this study. Using a three-step selection strategy, three strains were selected and further tested in vitro antiviral assays and in formulations: Lacticaseibacillus casei AMBR2 as a promising endogenous candidate URT probiotic with previously reported barrier-enhancing and anti-pathogenic properties and the two well-studied model strains Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum WCFS1 that display immunomodulatory capacities. The three strains and their combination significantly reduced the cytopathogenic effects of RSV, influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses, and HCoV-229E coronavirus in co-culture models with bacteria, virus, and host cells. Subsequently, these strains were formulated in a throat spray and human monocytes were employed to confirm the formulation process did not reduce the interferon regulatory pathway-inducing capacity. Administration of the throat spray in healthy volunteers revealed that the lactobacilli were capable of temporary colonization of the throat in a metabolically active form. Thus, the developed spray with live lactobacilli will be further explored in the clinic as a potential broad-acting live biotherapeutic strategy against respiratory viral diseases.

## The phosphorus harvest from low-temperature mainstream wastewater through iron phosphate crystallization in a pilot-scale partial nitritation/anammox reactor.
 09.12.2022, _Y Guo, EH Sanjaya, T Wang, C Rong, Z Luo, Y Xue, H Chen, YY Li_


The phosphorus harvest along nitrogen removal in the partial nitritation/anammox (PNA) reactor is promising for saving space and simplifying the management of mainstream wastewater treatment facilities. In this study, the phosphorus recovery from the low-temperature mainstream wastewater was explored through iron phosphate crystallization in a pilot-scale PNA reactor. With the COD-alleviated municipal wastewater as the influent, the ammonium concentration of about 50 mg/L and the phosphorus concentration ranged from 5.4 to 7.1 mg/L, under the temperature of 15 °C and the addition of external ferrous iron of 14 mg/L, the achieved nitrogen removal efficiency and the phosphorus removal efficiency were 37.6 % and 62.7 %, respectively. The good settleability of sludge indicated that the formed iron phosphate was well combined with the biomass. The quantitative analysis confirmed that the main iron phosphate in dry sludge was graftonite, and qualitative analysis confirmed that the equivalent of P2O5 content in the sludge was 5.8 %, which was suitable as fertilizer on agricultural land to realize the direct recycle of discharged phosphorus. In all, this study proposed a pioneering scheme to realize the nitrogen removal and phosphorus cycle in human society and given a meaningful reference for further research and application.
