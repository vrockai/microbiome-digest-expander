Dental implants are installed in an increasing number of patients. Mucositis and peri-implantitis are common microbial-biofilm-associated diseases affecting the tissues that surround the dental implant and are a major medical and socioeconomic burden. By metagenomic sequencing of the plaque microbiome in different peri-implant health and disease conditions (113 samples from 72 individuals), we found microbial signatures for peri-implantitis and mucositis and defined the peri-implantitis-related complex (PiRC) composed by the 7 most discriminative bacteria. The peri-implantitis microbiome is site specific as contralateral healthy sites resembled more the microbiome of healthy implants, while mucositis was specifically enriched for Fusobacterium nucleatum acting as a keystone colonizer. Microbiome-based machine learning showed high diagnostic and prognostic power for peri-implant diseases and strain-level profiling identified a previously uncharacterized subspecies of F. nucleatum to be particularly associated with disease. Altogether, we associated the plaque microbiome with peri-implant diseases and identified microbial signatures of disease severity.

## Delayed bowel perforation in electrocution: An unpredictable foe.
 23.11.2020, _D Goyal, A Dhiman, N Jagne, A Rattan_


Electrocution injuries, particularly high voltage, are uncommon, but can be devastating. Thermal burns, arrhythmias and myonecrosis are commonly known and monitored complications of electrical injuries. Direct thermal trauma to internal viscera is also known and almost all internal organs have been reported to be affected, bowel being the most common. However, bowel perforation occurring in a delayed fashion is one rare, dreaded and erratic complication of electrocution, making it a dangerous pitfall if missed. Alimentary tract perforations can present on a delayed basis in high voltage electrocution injuries; advise for clinical follow up must incorporate this possibility at the time of discharge. Presentation of delayed visceral injuries is subtle &amp; atypical, and post burn immunosuppression may play a part for such presentation. We suggest that all victims of high voltage electrocution with abdominal wall burns receive diagnostic laparoscopy and/or CECT abdomen as part of workup of their injuries. Any non-enhancing segment of bowel on CECT, howsoever small, should be prudently evaluated with laparoscopy.
