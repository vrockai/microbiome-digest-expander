 10.07.2020, _G Cammarota, G Ianiro, A Ahern, C Carbone, A Temko, MJ Claesson, A Gasbarrini, G Tortora_


The gut microbiome has been implicated in cancer in several ways, as specific microbial signatures are known to promote cancer development and influence safety, tolerability and efficacy of therapies. The 'omics' technologies used for microbiome analysis continuously evolve and, although much of the research is still at an early stage, large-scale datasets of ever increasing size and complexity are being produced. However, there are varying levels of difficulty in realizing the full potential of these new tools, which limit our ability to critically analyse much of the available data. In this Perspective, we provide a brief overview on the role of gut microbiome in cancer and focus on the need, role and limitations of a machine learning-driven approach to analyse large amounts of complex health-care information in the era of big data. We also discuss the potential application of microbiome-based big data aimed at promoting precision medicine in cancer.

## Co-evolution and Co-speciation of Host-Gut Bacteria Systems.
 09.07.2020, _M Groussin, F Mazel, EJ Alm_


Mammalian gut microbiomes profoundly influence host fitness, but the processes that drive the evolution of host-microbiome systems are poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that mammals and their individual gut symbionts can have parallel evolutionary histories, as represented by their congruent phylogenies. These "co-phylogenetic" patterns are signatures of ancient co-speciation events and illustrate the cohesiveness of the mammalian host-gut microbiome entity over evolutionary times. Theory predicts that co-speciation between mammals and their gut symbionts could result from their co-evolution. However, there is only limited evidence of such co-evolution. Here, we propose a model that explains cophylogenetic patterns without relying on co-evolution. Specifically, we suggest that individual gut bacteria are likely to diverge in patterns recapitulating host phylogeny when hosts undergo allopatric speciation, limiting inter-host bacterial dispersal and genomic recombination. We provide evidence that the model is empirically grounded and propose a series of observational and experimental approaches to test its validity.

## Dietary Strategies for Maintenance of Clinical Remission in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Are We There Yet?
 10.07.2020, _K Gkikas, K Gerasimidis, S Milling, UZ Ijaz, R Hansen, RK Russell_


The etiopathogenesis of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a result of a complex interaction between host immune response, the gut microbiome and environmental factors, such as diet. Although scientific advances, with the use of biological medications, have revolutionized IBD treatment, the challenge for maintaining clinical remission and delaying clinical relapse is still present. As exclusive enteral nutrition has become a well-established treatment for the induction of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease, the scientific interest regarding diet in IBD is now focused on the development of follow-on dietary strategies, which aim to suppress colonic inflammation and delay a disease flare. The objective of this review is to present an extensive overview of the dietary strategies, which have been used in the literature to maintain clinical remission in both Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, and the evidence surrounding the association of dietary components with clinical relapse. We also aim to provide study-related recommendations to be encompassed in future research studies aiming to investigate the role of diet during remission periods in IBD.

## The duodenal microbiome is altered in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
 09.07.2020, _G Leite, W Morales, S Weitsman, S Celly, G Parodi, R Mathur, GM Barlow, R Sedighi, MJV Millan, A Rezaie, M Pimentel_


Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is highly prevalent and is associated with numerous gastrointestinal disorders, but the microbes involved remain poorly defined. Moreover, existing studies of microbiome alterations in SIBO have utilized stool samples, which are not representative of the entire gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we aimed to determine and compare the duodenal microbiome composition in SIBO and non-SIBO subjects, using duodenal aspirates from subjects undergoing standard-of-care esophagogastroduodenoscopy without colon preparation. Using the recently-redefined cutoff for SIBO of &gt;103 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), 42 SIBO and 98 non-SIBO subjects were identified. Duodenal samples from SIBO subjects had 4x103-fold higher counts than non-SIBO subjects when plated on MacConkey agar (P&lt;0.0001), and 3.8-fold higher counts when plated on blood agar (P&lt;0.0001). Twenty subjects had also undergone lactulose hydrogen breath tests (LHBTs), of whom 7/20 had SIBO. At the 90-minute timepoint, 4/7 SIBO subjects had positive LHBTs (rise in hydrogen (H2) ≥ 20 ppm above baseline), as compared to 2/13 non-SIBO subjects. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing revealed that SIBO subjects had 4.31-fold higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria (FDR P&lt;0.0001) and 1.64-fold lower Firmicutes (P&lt;0.0003) than non-SIBO subjects. This increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria correlated with decreased α-diversity in SIBO subjects (Spearman R = 0.4866, P&lt;0.0001) Specific increases in class Gammaproteobacteria correlated with the area-under-the-curve for H2 for 0-90 mins during LHBT (R = 0.630, P = 0.002). Increases in Gammaproteobacteria resulted primarily from higher relative abundances of the family Enterobacteriaceae (FDR P&lt;0.0001), which correlated with the symptom of bloating (Spearman R = 0.185, 2-tailed P = 0.028). Increases in family Aeromonadaceae correlated with urgency with bowel movement (Spearman R = 0.186, 2-tailed P = 0.028). These results validate the &gt;103 CFU/mL cutoff for the definition of SIBO, and also reveal specific overgrowth of Proteobacteria in SIBO vs. non-SIBO subjects, coupled with an altered Proteobacterial profile that correlates with symptom severity. Future research may elucidate host-microbiome interactions underlying these symptoms in SIBO patients.

## Faecal microbiota transplantation: A life-saving therapy challenged by commercial claims for exclusivity.
 10.07.2020, _CL Hvas, SMD Baunwall, C Erikstrup_


Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an innovative treatment which is challenged by a regulatory struggle in Europe. A recent publication in EClinicalMedicine describes the successful adaptation of FMT to a National drug legislation, but this approach fails to take into account the donor-related aspects. The European tissue and cells directive and affiliated technical guide provide extensive safety and quality standards which may readily be adopted in an FMT service to provide patients with this life-saving treatment embedded in a public blood centre.

## Prototypical pacemaker neurons interact with the resident microbiota.
 10.07.2020, _A Klimovich, S Giacomello, Å Björklund, L Faure, M Kaucka, C Giez, AP Murillo-Rincon, AS Matt, D Willoweit-Ohl, G Crupi, J de Anda, GCL Wong, M D'Amato, I Adameyko, TCG Bosch_


Pacemaker neurons exert control over neuronal circuit function by their intrinsic ability to generate rhythmic bursts of action potential. Recent work has identified rhythmic gut contractions in human, mice, and hydra to be dependent on both neurons and the resident microbiota. However, little is known about the evolutionary origin of these neurons and their interaction with microbes. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized prototypical ANO/SCN/TRPM ion channel-expressing pacemaker cells in the basal metazoan Hydra by using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics, immunochemistry, and functional experiments. Unexpectedly, these prototypical pacemaker neurons express a rich set of immune-related genes mediating their interaction with the microbial environment. Furthermore, functional experiments gave a strong support to a model of the evolutionary emergence of pacemaker cells as neurons using components of innate immunity to interact with the microbial environment and ion channels to generate rhythmic contractions.

## Gut microbiota dysbiosis and altered tryptophan catabolism contribute to autoimmunity in lupus-susceptible mice.
 09.07.2020, _SC Choi, J Brown, M Gong, Y Ge, M Zadeh, W Li, BP Croker, G Michailidis, TJ Garrett, M Mohamadzadeh, L Morel_


The autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. It has been postulated that gut microbial dysbiosis may be one of the mechanisms involved in SLE pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the dysbiotic gut microbiota of triple congenic (TC) lupus-prone mice (B6.Sle1.Sle2.Sle3) stimulated the production of autoantibodies and activated immune cells when transferred into germfree congenic C57BL/6 (B6) mice. Fecal transfer to B6 mice induced autoimmune phenotypes only when the TC donor mice exhibited autoimmunity. Autoimmune pathogenesis was mitigated by horizontal transfer of the gut microbiota between co-housed lupus-prone TC mice and control congenic B6 mice. Metabolomic screening identified an altered distribution of tryptophan metabolites in the feces of TC mice including an increase in kynurenine, which was alleviated after antibiotic treatment. Low dietary tryptophan prevented autoimmune pathology in TC mice, whereas high dietary tryptophan exacerbated disease. Reducing dietary tryptophan altered gut microbial taxa in both lupus-prone TC mice and control B6 mice. Consequently, fecal transfer from TC mice fed a high tryptophan diet, but not a low tryptophan diet, induced autoimmune phenotypes in germfree B6 mice. The interplay of gut microbial dysbiosis, tryptophan metabolism and host genetic susceptibility in lupus-prone mice suggest that aberrant tryptophan metabolism may contribute to autoimmune activation in this disease.

## The relationship between gut microbiota and short chain fatty acids in the renal calcium oxalate stones disease.
 09.07.2020, _Y Liu, X Jin, HG Hong, L Xiang, Q Jiang, Y Ma, Z Chen, L Cheng, Z Jian, Z Wei, J Ai, S Qi, Q Sun, H Li, Y Li, K Wang_


The relationship of gut microbiota and calcium oxalate stone has been limited investigated, especially with no study of gut microbiota and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in nephrolithiasis. We provided Sprague Dawley rats of renal calcium oxalate stones with antibiotics and examined the renal crystals deposition. We also performed a case-control study by analyzing 16S rRNA microbial profiling, shotgun metagenomics and SCFAs in 153 fecal samples from non-kidney stone (NS) controls, patients with occasional renal calcium oxalate stones (OS) and patients with recurrent stones (RS). Antibiotics reduced bacterial load in feces and could promote the formation of renal calcium crystals in model rats. In addition, both OS and RS patients exhibited higher fecal microbial diversity than NS controls. Several SCFAs-producing gut bacteria, as well as metabolic pathways associated with SCFAs production, were considerably lower in the gut microbiota among the kidney stone patients compared with the NS controls. Representation of genes involved in oxalate degradation showed no significance difference among groups. However, fecal acetic acid concentration was the highest in RS patients with high level of urinary oxalate, which was positively correlated with genes involvement in oxalate synthesis. Administration of SCFAs reduced renal crystals. These results shed new light on bacteria and SCFAs, which may promote the development of treatment strategy in nephrolithiasis.

## Sodium Butyrate Alleviates Mouse Colitis by Regulating Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis.
 10.07.2020, _X Dou, N Gao, D Yan, A Shan_


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) develops as a result of complicated interactions between genetic susceptibility, excessive innate immunity, and environmental factors, which are mainly related to the gut microbiota. The present study aimed to elucidate the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of a short-chain fatty acid salt, sodium butyrate, on colonic inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Pretreatment with sodium butyrate attenuated colitis, as demonstrated by the decreased disease activity index (DAI), colon length shortening, spleen tumidness, and histopathology scores, while maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, as observed by H&amp;E staining and electron microscopy. 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that sodium butyrate caused a remarkable alteration of the gut microbiota. Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, the Lachnospiraceae NK4A136group, and Ruminiclostridium 6 presented dramatic differences after sodium butyrate supplementation. This work verifies that sodium butyrate can improve mouse colitis via microbe-host interactions by regulating the microbial community. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that sodium butyrate shows great potential as a probiotic agent for ameliorating colitis.

## Dietary sphinganine is selectively assimilated by members of the mammalian gut microbiome.
 10.07.2020, _MT Lee, HH Le, EL Johnson_


Functions of the gut microbiome have a growing number of implications for host metabolic health, with diet being one of the most significant influences on microbiome composition. Compelling links between diet and the gut microbiome suggest key roles for various macronutrients, including lipids, yet how individual classes of dietary lipids interact with the microbiome remains largely unknown. Sphingolipids are bioactive components of most foods and are also produced by prominent gut microbes. This makes sphingolipids intriguing candidates for shaping diet-microbiome interactions. Here, we used a click chemistry-based approach to track the incorporation of bioorthogonal dietary omega-alkynyl sphinganine (sphinganine alkyne [SAA]) into the murine gut microbial community (Bioorthogonal labeling). We identified microbial and SAA-specific metabolic products through fluorescence-based sorting of SAA-containing microbes (Sort), 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the sphingolipid-interacting microbes (Seq), and comparative metabolomics to identify products of SAA assimilation by the microbiome (Spec). Together, this approach, termed Bioorthogonal labeling-Sort-Seq-Spec (BOSSS), revealed that SAA assimilation is nearly exclusively performed by gut Bacteroides, indicating that sphingolipid-producing bacteria play a major role in processing dietary sphinganine. Comparative metabolomics of cecal microbiota from SAA-treated mice revealed conversion of SAA to a suite of dihydroceramides, consistent with metabolic activities of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Additionally, other sphingolipid-interacting microbes were identified with a focus on an uncharacterized ability of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium to metabolize dietary sphingolipids. We conclude that BOSSS provides a platform to study the flux of virtually any alkyne-labeled metabolite in diet-microbiome interactions.

## Quantitative comparison between the rhizosphere effect of Arabidopsis thaliana and co-occurring plant species with a longer life history.
 09.07.2020, _M Schneijderberg, X Cheng, C Franken, M de Hollander, R van Velzen, L Schmitz, R Heinen, R Geurts, WH van der Putten, TM Bezemer, T Bisseling_


As a model for genetic studies, Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) offers great potential to unravel plant genome-related mechanisms that shape the root microbiome. However, the fugitive life history of this species might have evolved at the expense of investing in capacity to steer an extensive rhizosphere effect. To determine whether the rhizosphere effect of Arabidopsis is different from other plant species that have a less fugitive life history, we compared the root microbiome of Arabidopsis to eight other, later succession plant species from the same habitat. The study included molecular analysis of soil, rhizosphere, and endorhizosphere microbiome both from the field and from a laboratory experiment. Molecular analysis revealed that the rhizosphere effect (as quantified by the number of enriched and depleted bacterial taxa) was ~35% lower than the average of the other eight species. Nevertheless, there are numerous microbial taxa differentially abundant between soil and rhizosphere, and they represent for a large part the rhizosphere effects of the other plants. In the case of fungal taxa, the number of differentially abundant taxa in the Arabidopsis rhizosphere is 10% of the other species' average. In the plant endorhizosphere, which is generally more selective, the rhizosphere effect of Arabidopsis is comparable to other species, both for bacterial and fungal taxa. Taken together, our data imply that the rhizosphere effect of the Arabidopsis is smaller in the rhizosphere, but equal in the endorhizosphere when compared to plant species with a less fugitive life history.

## Anthropogenic dissolved organic carbon and marine microbiomes.
 10.07.2020, _M Vila-Costa, E Cerro-Gálvez, A Martínez-Varela, G Casas, J Dachs_


Thousands of synthetic chemicals and hydrocarbons are released to the marine environment composing the anthropogenic dissolved organic carbon (ADOC). Most ADOC is disproportionally hydrophobic, and consequently, its concentrations in the cell membranes are between a thousand and hundred million fold higher than those in the dissolved phase. Marine microorganisms respond to ADOC by multiple strategies ranging from ADOC degradation to detoxifying metabolisms. We argue that the increasing concentrations of ADOC in the oceans deriving from rivers, atmospheric deposition, and plastic leachates can have an effect on the health of the oceans and influence the major biogeochemical cycles, thus influencing the Earth system during the Anthropocene.

## SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via contact and via the air between ferrets.

SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that emerged in late 2019, has spread rapidly worldwide, and information about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among humans is critical to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and/or aerosols) between ferrets, 1 to 3 days and 3 to 7 days after exposure respectively. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets is similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus is isolated from all positive animals, showing that ferrets are productively infected via either route. This study provides experimental evidence of robust transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the air, supporting the implementation of community-level social distancing measures currently applied in many countries in the world and informing decisions on infection control measures in healthcare settings.
