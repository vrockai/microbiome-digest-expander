## Effects of Urbanization and Landscape on Gut Microbiomes in White-Crowned Sparrows.
 17.08.2020, _M Berlow, JN Phillips, EP Derryberry_


Habitats are changing rapidly around the globe and urbanization is one of the primary drivers. Urbanization changes food availability, environmental stressors, and the prevalence of disease for many species. These changes can lead to divergence in phenotypic traits, including behavioral, physiological, and morphological features between urban and rural populations. Recent research highlights that urbanization is also changing the gut microbial communities found in a diverse group of host species. These changes have not been uniform, leaving uncertainty as to how urban habitats are shaping gut microbial communities. To better understand these effects, we investigated the gut bacterial communities of White-Crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys) populations along an urbanization gradient in the San Francisco Bay area. We examined how gut bacterial communities vary with the local environment and host morphological characteristics. We found direct effects of environmental factors, including urban noise levels and territory land cover, as well as indirect effects through body size and condition, on alpha and beta diversity of gut microbial communities. We also found that urban and rural birds' microbiomes differed in which variables predicted their diversity, with urban communities driven by host morphology, and rural communities driven by environmental factors. Elucidating these effects provides a better understanding of how urbanization affects wild avian physiology.

## Passenger-surface microbiome interactions in the subway of Mexico City.
 19.08.2020, _D Vargas-Robles, C Gonzalez-Cedillo, AM Hernandez, LD Alcaraz, M Peimbert_


Interaction between hands and the environment permits the interchange of microorganisms. The Mexico City subway is used daily by millions of passengers that get in contact with its surfaces. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbiomes of frequently touched surfaces and compare regular and women-only wagons. We also explored the effect of surface cleaning on microbial resettling. Finally, we studied passenger behavior and characterized microbial changes after traveling. Most passengers (99%), showed some type of surface interaction during a wagon trip, mostly with the hands (92%). We found microbiome differences associated with surfaces, probably reflecting diverse surface materials and usage frequency. The platform floor was the most bacterial diverse surface, while the stair handrail and pole were the least diverse ones. After pole cleaning, the resettling of microbial diversity was fast (5-30 minutes); however, it did not resemble the initial composition. After traveling, passengers significantly increased their hand microbial diversity and converged to a similar microbial composition among passengers. Additionally, passenger hand microbiomes resembled subway surfaces in diversity. However, microbial fingerprints were preserved within passengers after traveling.

## Plant resistance and leaf chemical characteristic jointly shape phyllosphere bacterial community.
 18.08.2020, _T Xueliang, X Dan, S Tingting, Z Songyu, L Ying, W Diandong_


Phyllosphere bacteria have an important role in plant growth and resistance to pathogen infection and are partially influenced by plant genotype and leaf environment. How plant resistance to pathogens and leaf chemical characteristics shape the phyllosphere bacterial communities is unclear. In this study, the phyllosphere bacterial communities of maize hybrids with various resistance to Setosphaeria turcica were compared using the high-throughput sequencing and large-scale culturing methods. The results showed that Shannon and Simpson indices of phyllosphere bacterial communities were markedly higher in the highly resistant hybrid (HR) compared with the susceptible one. Hierarchical clustering analysis, unweighted UniFrac principal component analysis (PCoA) and the analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) demonstrated that the phyllosphere bacterial communities were significantly distinct between resistant and susceptible hybrids. The redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that leaf chemical characteristics, including nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, and disease resistance play an important role in shaping the phyllosphere bacterial community. Linear discriminant effect size (LEfSe) analysis indicated that Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Tumebacillus were the biomarker species in the phyllosphere of HR. Biocontrol bacteria against S. turcica (such as Pseudomonas and Bacillus) were isolated from the phyllosphere of HR by large-scale culturing. The work contributes to understanding of the phyllosphere bacterial community assembly and provides a new clue to screening for strong biocontrol bacteria from HR and to facilitating future breeding efforts for enhancing disease resistance.
