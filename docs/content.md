## Predictive values of colon microbiota in the treatment response to colorectal cancer.
 08.09.2020, _J Galan-Ros, V Ramos-Arenas, P Conesa-Zamora_


The crosstalk between the colon mucosa and the microbiota represents a complex and delicate equilibrium. Gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer (CRC) are associated with a state of altered microbiota composition known as dysbiosis, which seems to play a causative role in some of these illnesses. Recent reports have shown that the colorectal microbiome is responsible for the response and safety to treatments against CRC, especially immunotherapy, hence opening the possibility to use bacteria as a predictive marker and also as a therapeutic agent. The review objective is to summarize updated reports about the the implication of the colorectal microbiome in the development of CRC, in treatment response and its potential as a therapeutic approach.

## Long-term effects of western diet consumption in male and female mice.
 08.09.2020, _Y Hasegawa, SY Chen, L Sheng, PK Jena, KM Kalanetra, DA Mills, YY Wan, CM Slupsky_


Long-term consumption of a diet with excessive fat and sucrose (Western diet, WD) leads to an elevated risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome in both males and females. However, there are sexual dimorphisms in metabolism which are apparent when considering the prevalence of complications of metabolic syndrome, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of a WD on the metabolome and the gut microbiota of male and female mice at 5, 10, and 15 months to capture the dynamic and comprehensive changes brought about by diet at different stages of life. Here we show that there are important considerations of age and sex that should be considered when assessing the impact of diet on the gut microbiome and health.

## Young versus aged microbiota transplants to germ-free mice: increased short-chain fatty acids and improved cognitive performance.
 08.09.2020, _J Lee, VR Venna, DJ Durgan, H Shi, J Hudobenko, N Putluri, J Petrosino, LD McCullough, RM Bryan_


Aging is associated with cognitive decline and decreased concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the gut. SCFAs are significant in that they are protective to the gut and other organs. We tested the hypothesis that the aged gut microbiome alone is sufficient to decrease SCFAs in the host and produces cognitive decline. Fecal transplant gavages (FTGs) from aged (18-20 months) or young (2-3 months) male C57BL/6 mice into germ-free male C57BL/6 mice (N = 11 per group) were initiated at ~3 months of age. Fecal samples were collected and behavioral testing was performed over the study period. Bacterial community structures and relative abundances were measured in fecal samples by sequencing the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Mice with aged and young microbiomes showed clear differences in bacterial β diversity at 30, 60, and 90 d (P = .001 for each) after FTGs. The fecal SCFAs, acetate, propionate, and butyrate (microbiome effect, P &lt; .01 for each) were decreased in mice with an aged microbiome. Mice with an aged microbiome demonstrated depressive-like behavior, impaired short-term memory, and impaired spatial memory over the 3 months following the initial FTG as assessed by the tail suspension (P = .008), the novel object recognition (P &lt; .001), and the Barnes Maze (P = .030) tests, respectively. We conclude that an aged microbiome alone is sufficient to decrease SCFAs in the host and to produce cognitive decline.

## Temporal changes in the fecal bacterial community in Holstein dairy calves from birth through the transition to a solid diet.

The development of a robust microbiome is critical to the health of dairy calves, but relatively little is known about the progression of the microbiome through the weaning transition. In this study, fecal samples were obtained from ten female Holstein calves at 6 timepoints between 2-13 weeks of age. Calves were fed acidified milk until weaning at 8 weeks old and had access to starter grain throughout the study. Fecal samples were extracted for genomic DNA, PCR-amplified for the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene, sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform, and analyzed using the QIIME2 pipeline. Bacterial richness, estimated by number of observed species, and bacterial diversity, estimated by Shannon diversity index, both differed significantly between timepoints and both increased over time (P &lt;0.05), with the largest increases occurring during weaning. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac analysis showed significant differences (P &lt;0.05) between bacterial communities across timepoints; betadisper analysis revealed that the microbiomes of individual calves became more similar with time. Throughout the study, Firmicutes was the dominant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes. Thirteen bacterial genera were found to be significantly influenced by time, including Faecalibacterium, Clostridium, unclassified S24-7, Collinsella, Sharpea, and Treponema. Unclassified Ruminococcaceae was the most prevalent genus at timepoints 1, 3, 5, and 6, but different amplicon sequence variants were detected at each timepoint suggesting the presence of different species of Ruminococcaceae at different times. Bacteroides was the most prevalent genus at timepoint 2, and Prevotella was most prevalent at timepoint 4. Our results indicate that there is considerable variation in the calf microbiome pre-weaning, but the microbial community stabilizes and becomes similar to the adult microbiome at weaning. Further studies to describe the phylogeny and functionality of core microbiota through the weaning transition are needed to improve health and reduce diarrhea in the neonatal period.

## Comparison of the microbial diversity during two different wine fermentation processes.

Wine production is a complex procedure in which an important role is played by many microorganisms, particularly yeasts and bacteria. In modern wineries, alcoholic fermentation is usually carried out by adding microbial starter cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains for precisely controlled production. Nowadays, in Slovak republic, autochthonous vinification is getting more popular. The presented article deals with the comparison of two vinification approaches, namely spontaneous and controlled by a standard commercial S. cerevisiae starter, from the point of view of microbiota dynamics and the chemical characteristics of the produced wines. The dynamics of microbial populations were determined during the fermentation process by 16S and 28S rRNA next-generation sequencing approach. Profile of the volatile compounds during these fermentation processes was identified by SPME-GC/MS analysis. In summary, the microbial diversity in the m1 phase (initial must) was higher, despite the presence of the starter culture. In the m3 phase (young wine), the microbiome profiles of both batches were very similar. It seems that the crucial phase in order to study the relationship of the microbiome and the resulting product should be based on the m2 phase (fermented must), where the differences between autochthonous and inoculated batch were more evident.
