## Human microbiome and allergy.
 25.11.2020, _V Montecchiani, V Fanos_


Human microbiome contributes to critical functions that impact health and disease. It influences the development of the immune system, and the pathogenesis of immunological disorders included allergy. While it is easy to understand how airway microbiome, influencing local inflammation and immune activity, could contribute to shaping asthma phenotype, it is not so obvious to understand the influence by the gut microbiome, but there is growing evidence about it. The increase of allergic disorders in western countries led to investigate the role environment is playing and how it may change our microbiome and immune system, with the hope of finding new preventive approaches for allergy.

 27.11.2020, _K Schei, MR Simpson, E Avershina, K Rudi, T Øien, PB Júlíusson, D Underhill, S Salamati, RA Ødegård_


Introduction: Childhood growth is a sensitive marker of health. Animal studies show increased height and weight velocity in the presence of fungal as well as antibiotic supplement in feed. Human studies on early gut microbiota and anthropometrics have mainly focused on bacteria only and overweight, with diverging results. We thus aimed to investigate the associations between childhood growth [height and body mass index (BMI)] and early fungal and bacterial gut microbiota. Methods: In a population-based cohort, a subset of 278 pregnant mothers was randomized to drink milk with or without probiotic bacteria during and after pregnancy. We obtained fecal samples in offspring at four time points between 0 and 2 years and anthropometric measurements 0 and 9 years. By quantitative PCR and 16S/ITS rRNA gene sequencing, children's gut microbiota abundance and diversity were analyzed against height standard deviation score (SDS) and BMI-SDS and presented as effect estimate (β) of linear mixed models. Results: From 278 included children (149 girls), 1,015 fecal samples were collected. Maternal probiotic administration did not affect childhood growth, and the groups were pooled. Fungal abundance at 2 years was positively associated with height-SDS at 2-9 years (β = 0.11 height-SDS; 95% CI, 0.00, 0.22) but not with BMI-SDS. Also, higher fungal abundance at 1 year was associated with a lower BMI-SDS at 0-1 year (β = -0.09 BMI-SDS; 95% CI, -0.18, -0.00), and both bacterial abundance and bacterial alpha diversity at 1 year were associated with lower BMI-SDS at 0-1 year (β = -0.13 BMI-SDS; 95% CI, -0.22, -0.04; and β = -0.19 BMI-SDS; 95% CI, -0.39, -0.00, respectively). Conclusions: In this prospective cohort following 0-9-year-old children, we observed that higher gut fungal abundances at 2 years were associated with taller children between 2 and 9 years. Also, higher gut fungal and bacterial abundances and higher gut bacterial diversity at 1 year were associated with lower BMI in the first year of life. The results may indicate interactions between early gut fungal microbiota and the human growth-regulating physiology, previously not reported.

## A Pilot Study: Changes of Intestinal Microbiota of Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in Response to Osimertinib Therapy.
 27.11.2020, _J Cong, Y Zhang, Y Xue, C Zhang, M Xu, D Liu, R Zhang, H Zhu_


Osimertinib contributes to the higher efficacy and few intestinal side effects in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with T790M mutation. Previous studies has reported that intestinal microbiota play important roles in drug efficacy and toxicity. However, we have known less about the changes of intestinal microbiota in response to osimertinib therapy. In this pilot study, we used longitudinal sampling with 6 weeks sampling collection intervals for about 1 year to model intestinal microbial changes based on the 16S rRNA genes sequencing in fecal samples from NSCLC patients in response to osimertinib therapy. The results showed that there was no significantly different on the intestinal microbial composition at the phylum, family, and genus level among NSCLC patients with different treatment cycles (P &gt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in alpha diversity characterized by the richness, Shannon diversity, and phylogenetic diversity based on the Welch's t-test among NSCLC patients in response to osimertinib therapy (P &gt; 0.05). However, the dissimilarity test and principal coordination analysis showed a few differences among NSCLC patients. The intestinal microbial markers were changed in post-therapy (Sutterella, Peptoniphilus, and Anaeroglobus) compared to that in pre-therapy (Clostridium XIVa). Furthermore, the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks (MENs) were influenced by osimertinib therapy based on the module number, link number, and module taxa composition of the first six groups. Overall, it indicated that osimertinib therapy changed the intestinal microbiota to some extent, though not completely. In all, this pilot study provides an understanding of changes of intestinal microbiota from NSCLC patients in response to osimertinib therapy. No complete changes in intestinal microbiota seem to be closely linked with the few intestinal side effects and higher efficacy in response to osimertinib therapy.

## What connection is there between intestinal microbiota and heart disease?
 27.11.2020, _A Poli_


Information on the correlation between intestinal microbiota and cardiovascular risk is growing. Some species of the microbiota influence the metabolism of specific food components (such as carnitine, choline, phosphatidyl-choline), synthesizing the precursor of trimethylamine oxide, a molecule with documented harmful activity on the vascular wall. Other strains, on the other hand, metabolize dietary fibre by synthesizing short-chain fatty acids, which have a significant anti-inflammatory activity, or produce secondary metabolites originating from molecules present in food (such as enterodiol, which derives from lignin), characterized by a vascular protection activity. Prebiotic effects from plant compounds (such as berberine or resveratrol) are also documented, which would induce favourable changes in the composition of the microbiota. The possibility of influencing the composition and activity of the intestinal microbiota will probably represent, in the future, an important component of cardiovascular prevention strategies.

## The Student-Centered Classroom: The New Gut Feeling.
 24.11.2020, _JK Lyles, M Oli_


A student-centered, interactive course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) was implemented in a microbiology course in order to provide an authentic research experience and to stimulate student interest and improve understanding of fermentation, probiotics, the human microbiome, and related topics. Students were immersed in the scientific process as they used fundamental techniques to investigate the probiotic composition of a fermented milk beverage, kefir-an unknown question with no predetermined outcomes. In order to assess the benefits and effect of this learning experience on the students, pre- and post-study surveys were administered using Qualtrics. Post-study, 93% of participants agreed that fermented foods are beneficial to human health (compared to 52% pre-study), and notably, 100% of participants indicated that they plan to apply this material in both their personal and professional lives and would suggest consuming probiotics or fermented products to alleviate gastrointestinal issues. As evidenced by demographic data, this CURE is suitable for implementation at both large and small institutions with diverse student populations. Collectively, these data indicate that this collaborative, discovery-based learning experience is a powerful educational tool, encouraging students to make real-life connections between microbiology, medicine, and their own health.

## Comparison of the fecal microbiota composition between the blue Sheep (Pseudois nayaur) fed with Lolium perenne and Sorghum sudanense.
 26.11.2020, _H Wu, Y Yuan, H Pan_


Lolium perenne L. and Sorghum sudanense (Piper) Stapf. are two common forages fed to the captive blue sheep. However, the effect of these two forages on the gastrointestinal microbiota is largely unknown. We analyzed the microbiota diversity in feces of the captive blue sheep fed with L. perenne (F1) and S. sudanense (F2) by 16S rRNA sequencing. A total number of 20 major phyla and 29 genera fecal bacterial communities were detected in the two groups. The F1 and F2 groups shared common microbiota at the phylum level, which mainly consisted of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013 and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 were top four dominant taxa at the genus level. The percentage of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 in F2 was significantly higher than that in F1 (~2.75 fold). The diversity and abundance of the microbial community in F2 were higher than that in F1. Although both of the L. perenne and S. sudanense effect the blue sheep gastrointestinal microbiota metabolism, the S. sudanense improves more aspects in metabolism and biogenesis. In summary, our results demonstrated that the L. perenne and S. sudanense effect the blue sheep gastrointestinal microbiota in different ways. But S. sudanense efficiently improved the blue sheep gastrointestinal microbiota.
