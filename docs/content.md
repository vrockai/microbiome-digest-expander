## Prokaryotic names: the bold and the beautiful.
 16.09.2020, _A Oren_


In recent years, names of ∼170 new genera and ∼1020 new species were added annually to the list of prokaryotic names with standing in the nomenclature. These names were formed in accordance with the Rules of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes. Most of these names are not very interesting as specific epithets and word elements from existing names are repeatedly recycled. The rules of the Code provide many opportunities to create names in far more original ways. A survey of the lists of names of genera and species of prokaryotes shows that there is no lack of interesting names. The annotated selection presented here proves that at least some authors have exploited the possibilities allowed by the rules of the Code to name novel organisms in ways that are more attractive. I here call upon all colleagues who describe new taxa to devote more thought to the naming of new genera and species. It takes some effort, and it requires proper use of the lexicon of Classical Greek and Latin as well as an understanding of the Code and the guidelines of its orthography appendix. Creation of attractive names will boost the general interest in prokaryotic nomenclature.

## Understanding the impact of antibiotic perturbation on the human microbiome.
 02.10.2020, _DJ Schwartz, AE Langdon, G Dantas_


The human gut microbiome is a dynamic collection of bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses that performs essential functions for immune development, pathogen colonization resistance, and food metabolism. Perturbation of the gut microbiome's ecological balance, commonly by antibiotics, can cause and exacerbate diseases. To predict and successfully rescue such perturbations, first, we must understand the underlying taxonomic and functional dynamics of the microbiome as it changes throughout infancy, childhood, and adulthood. We offer an overview of the healthy gut bacterial architecture over these life stages and comment on vulnerability to short and long courses of antibiotics. Second, the resilience of the microbiome after antibiotic perturbation depends on key characteristics, such as the nature, timing, duration, and spectrum of a course of antibiotics, as well as microbiome modulatory factors such as age, travel, underlying illness, antibiotic resistance pattern, and diet. In this review, we discuss acute and chronic antibiotic perturbations to the microbiome and resistome in the context of microbiome stability and dynamics. We specifically discuss key taxonomic and resistance gene changes that accompany antibiotic treatment of neonates, children, and adults. Restoration of a healthy gut microbial ecosystem after routine antibiotics will require rationally managed exposure to specific antibiotics and microbes. To that end, we review the use of fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics to direct recolonization of the gut ecosystem. We conclude with our perspectives on how best to assess, predict, and aid recovery of the microbiome after antibiotic perturbation.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, especially those with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD), exhibit high prevalence of periodontitis. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the periodontal status of HD patients and its relationship with salivary microbiome.

## Phytochemicals as modifiers of gut microbial communities.
 30.09.2020, _G Dingeo, A Brito, H Samouda, M Iddir, MR La Frano, T Bohn_


A healthy gut microbiota (GM) is paramount for a healthy lifestyle. Alterations of the GM have been involved in the aetiology of several chronic diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. In pathological conditions, the diversity of the GM is commonly reduced or altered, often toward an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. The colonic fermentation of dietary fiber has shown to stimulate the fraction of bacteria purported to have beneficial health effects, acting as prebiotics, and to increase the production of short chain fatty acids, e.g. propionate and butyrate, while also improving gut epithelium integrity such as tight junction functionality. However, a variety of phytochemicals, often associated with dietary fiber, have also been proposed to modulate the GM. Many phytochemicals possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may positively affect the GM, including polyphenols, carotenoids, phytosterols/phytostanols, lignans, alkaloids, glucosinolates and terpenes. Some polyphenols may act as prebiotics, while carotenoids have been shown to alter immunoglobulin A expression, an important factor for bacteria colonization. Other phytochemicals may interact with the mucosa, another important factor for colonization, and prevent its degradation. Certain polyphenols have shown to influence bacterial communication, interacting with quorum sensing. Finally, phytochemicals can be metabolized in the gut into bioactive constituents, e.g. equol from daidzein and enterolactone from secoisolariciresinol, while bacteria can use glycosides for energy. In this review, we strive to highlight the potential interactions between prominent phytochemicals and health benefits related to the GM, emphasizing their potential as adjuvant strategies for GM-related diseases.

## Relationship between the bacterial community structures on human hair and scalp.
 30.09.2020, _K Watanabe, A Yamada, Y Nishi, Y Tashiro, K Sakai_


In this study, we investigated and compared characteristics of the bacterial community structures on hair (scalp hair) and scalp in 18 individuals. Significant differences were found between the sites, in terms of cell density, alpha and beta diversity, and relative abundance of the phyla, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, whereas no difference was found in relative abundance of the phylum Actinobacteria. Bacteria of the genus Cutibacterium showed similar relative abundance at both sites, whereas those of genus Pseudomonas were highly abundant on hair, and those of genus Staphylococcus were significantly lesser in abundance on hair than on scalp. Statistical correlations between the sites were high for the individual relative abundance of five major operational taxonomic units (OTUs). This suggests that the bacterial community structure on hair is composed of hair-specific genus, Pseudomonas, and skin-derived genera, Cutibacterium and Staphylococcus, and is distinguishable from other human skin microbiomes.
