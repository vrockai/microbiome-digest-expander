## The pneumococcal social network.
 03.11.2020, _SD Aggarwal, H Yesilkaya, S Dawid, NL Hiller_


Gram-positive bacteria employ an array of secreted peptides to control population-level behaviors in response to environmental cues. We review mechanistic and functional features of secreted peptides produced by the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. We discuss sequence features, mechanisms of transport, and receptors for 3 major categories of small peptides: the double-glycine peptides, the Rap, Rgg, NprR, PlcR, and PrgX (RRNPP)-binding peptides, and the lanthionine-containing peptides. We highlight the impact of factors that contribute to carriage and pathogenesis, specifically genetic diversity, microbial competition, biofilm development, and environmental adaptation. A recent expansion in pneumococcal peptide studies reveals a complex network of interacting signaling systems where multiple peptides are integrated into the same signaling pathway, allowing multiple points of entry into the pathway and extending information content in new directions. In addition, since peptides are present in the extracellular milieu, there are opportunities for crosstalk, quorum sensing (QS), as well as intra- and interstrain and species interactions. Knowledge on the manner that population-level behaviors contribute to disease provides an avenue for the design and development of anti-infective strategies.

## Low-cost biofuel-powered autoclaving machine for use in rural health care centres.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) in developing countries have been linked to inadequate availability of sterilising equipment. Existing autoclaves are mostly unaffordable by rural healthcare practitioners, and when they managed to procure them, the electricity supply to power the autoclaves is epileptic. The solar-powered autoclave alternatives are too bulky with a very high initial cost. Hence, low-cost biofuel-powered autoclave becomes an attractive option, and this study sought to present the design, development and clinical evaluation of the device performance. With the global drive for the adoption of green energy, biofuel will not only reduce greenhouse gas emission but also provide revenue for local producers and reduce biomass associated health complications. The theoretical energy requirement for the sterilisation process was calculated. The standard pressure and temperature needed for sterilisation were tested to be 121 °C and 15 psi. The device was also clinically tested with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria obtained from the Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital using Brain heart Infusion Broth, MacConkey and Blood agar as cultured media. No bacteria growth was observed when the samples containing the bacteria colony were autoclaved by the designed autoclave and incubated at 37 °C for 2 d. Hence, the device met the mechanical and biological validation standards for effective sterilisation.

## Harnessing the power of eDNA metabarcoding for the detection of deep-sea fishes.
 04.11.2020, _B McClenaghan, N Fahner, D Cote, J Chawarski, A McCarthy, H Rajabi, G Singer, M Hajibabaei_


The deep ocean is the largest biome on Earth and faces increasing anthropogenic pressures from climate change and commercial fisheries. Our ability to sustainably manage this expansive habitat is impeded by our poor understanding of its inhabitants and by the difficulties in surveying and monitoring these areas. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has great potential to improve our understanding of this region and to facilitate monitoring across a broad range of taxa. Here, we evaluate two eDNA sampling protocols and seven primer sets for elucidating fish diversity from deep sea water samples. We found that deep sea water samples (&gt; 1400 m depth) had significantly lower DNA concentrations than surface or mid-depth samples necessitating a refined protocol with a larger sampling volume. We recovered significantly more DNA in large volume water samples (1.5 L) filtered at sea compared to small volume samples (250 mL) held for lab filtration. Furthermore, the number of unique sequences (exact sequence variants; ESVs) recovered per sample was higher in large volume samples. Since the number of ESVs recovered from large volume samples was less variable and consistently high, we recommend the larger volumes when sampling water from the deep ocean. We also identified three primer sets which detected the most fish taxa but recommend using multiple markers due the variability in detection probabilities and taxonomic resolution among fishes for each primer set. Overall, fish diversity results obtained from metabarcoding were comparable to conventional survey methods. While eDNA sampling and processing need be optimized for this unique environment, the results of this study demonstrate that eDNA metabarcoding can facilitate biodiversity surveys in the deep ocean, require less dedicated survey effort per unit identification, and are capable of simultaneously providing valuable information on other taxonomic groups.
