We developed a gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model colonised with defined commensal microbiota (DMF) to provide a simplified and controlled system to study the interactions between intestinal commensals, antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, CIP), probiotics (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, EcN) and virulent human rotavirus (VirHRV). The DMF included seven gut commensal species of porcine origin that mimic the predominant species in the infant gut. Gn piglets were divided into four groups: DMF control (non-treated), DMF+CIP (CIP treated), DMF+CIP+EcN (CIP/EcN treated), DMF+EcN (EcN treated) and inoculated orally with 105 cfu of each DMF strain. The pig gut was successfully colonised by all DMF species and established a simplified bacterial community by post-bacteria colonisation day (PBCD) 14/post-VirHRV challenge day (PCD) 0. Overall, Bifidobacterium adolescentis was commonly observed in faeces in all groups and time points. At PCD0, after six days of CIP treatment (DMF+CIP), we observed significantly decreased aerobic and anaerobic bacteria counts especially in jejunum (P&lt;0.001), where no DMF species were detected in jejunum by T-RFLP. Following HRV challenge, 100% of pigs in DMF+CIP group developed diarrhoea with higher diarrhoea scores and duration as compared to all other groups. However, only 33% of pigs treated with EcN plus CIP developed diarrhoea. EcN treatment also enhanced the bacterial diversity and all seven DMF species were detected with a higher proportion of Bifidobacterium longum in jejunum in the DMF+CIP+EcN group on PBCD14/PCD0. Our results suggest that EcN increased the proportion of B. longum especially in jejunum and mitigated adverse impacts of antibiotic use during acute-infectious diarrhoea. The DMF model with a simplified gut commensal community can further our knowledge of how commensals and probiotics promote intestinal homeostasis and contribute to host health.
