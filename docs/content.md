## Advancing microbiome research in M훮ori populations: insights from recent literature exploring the gut microbiomes of underrepresented and Indigenous peoples.

The gut microbiome plays vital roles in human health, including mediating metabolism, immunity, and the gut-brain axis. Many ethnicities remain underrepresented in gut microbiome research, with significant variation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples due to dietary, socioeconomic, health, and urbanization differences. Although research regarding the microbiomes of Indigenous peoples is increasing, M훮ori microbiome literature is lacking despite widespread inequities that M훮ori populations face. These inequities likely contribute to gut microbiome differences that exacerbate negative health outcomes. Characterizing the gut microbiomes of underrepresented populations is necessary to inform efforts to address health inequities. However, for microbiome research to be culturally responsible and meaningful, study design must improve to better protect the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples. Here, we discuss barriers to Indigenous participation in research and the role disparities may play in shaping the gut microbiomes of Indigenous peoples, with a particular focus on implications for M훮ori and areas for improvement.
