Depression is highly prevalent in individuals on hemodialysis, but it is infrequently identified and remains undertreated. In this paper, we present details of the methodology of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at testing the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 5-week positive psychological intervention in individuals on hemodialysis with comorbid depression delivered using immersive virtual reality (VR) technology.

_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Determination of Tr1 cell populations correlating with distinct activation states in acute IAV infection.
 15.06.2023, _CA Abbott, EL Freimayer, TS Tyllis, TS Norton, M Alsharifi, A H S Heng, SM Pederson, Z Qu, M Armstrong, GR Hill, SR McColl, I Comerford_


Type I regulatory (Tr1) cells are defined as FOXP3-IL-10-secreting CD4+ T cells that contribute to immune suppression and typically express the markers LAG-3 and CD49b and other co-inhibitory receptors. These cells have not been studied in detail the context of the resolution of acute infection in the lung. Here, we identify FOXP3-IL-10+ CD4+ T cells transiently accumulating in the lung parenchyma during resolution of the response to sublethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice. These cells were dependent on IL-27Rα, which was required for timely recovery from IAV-induced weight loss. LAG-3 and CD49b were not generally co-expressed by FOXP3- IL-10+ CD4+ T cells in this model and four populations of these cells based on LAG-3 and CD49b co-expression were apparent (LAG-3-CD49b- [DN], LAG-3+CD49b+ [DP], LAG-3+CD49b- [LAG-3+], LAG-3-CD49b+ [CD49b+]). However, each population exhibited suppressive potential consistent with the definition of Tr1 cells. Notably, differences between these populations of Tr1 cells were apparent including differential dependence on IL-10 to mediate suppression and expression of markers indicative of different activation states and terminal differentiation. Sort-transfer experiments indicated that LAG-3+ Tr1 cells exhibited the capacity to convert to DN and DP Tr1 cells, indicative of plasticity between these populations. Together, these data determine the features and suppressive potential of Tr1 cells in the resolution of IAV infection and identify four populations delineated by LAG-3 and CD49b, which likely correspond to different Tr1 cell activation states.

## Obesity: Policy and Practice Recommendations for High-Risk Populations Influenced by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
 22.12.2022, _KN Robinson, DA Saber_


_Humans, United States, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Pandemics, Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype, Obesity, Policy_
Obesity has been linked to higher morbidity and mortality in those that contract novel viruses, such as H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. Loss of life and the high cost of obesity highlight the need to focus on preventative measures. The state of Maine (United States) is profiled as a rural state with high rates of obesity and low health literacy that benefits from programs to improve health. However, more multidirectional efforts are needed. Four recommendations for building a healthier, more resilient patient population are discussed here: (i) state incentives and subsidies, (ii) employers to incentivize healthy living, (iii) federal incentives and initiatives, and (iv) personal responsibility for health and wellness.

## Globally consistent response of plant microbiome diversity across hosts and continents to soil nutrients and herbivores.

_Herbivory, Biomass, Microbiota, Nutrients, Soil_
All multicellular organisms host a diverse microbiome composed of microbial pathogens, mutualists, and commensals, and changes in microbiome diversity or composition can alter host fitness and function. Nonetheless, we lack a general understanding of the drivers of microbiome diversity, in part because it is regulated by concurrent processes spanning scales from global to local. Global-scale environmental gradients can determine variation in microbiome diversity among sites, however an individual host's microbiome also may reflect its local micro-environment. We fill this knowledge gap by experimentally manipulating two potential mediators of plant microbiome diversity (soil nutrient supply and herbivore density) at 23 grassland sites spanning global-scale gradients in soil nutrients, climate, and plant biomass. Here we show that leaf-scale microbiome diversity in unmanipulated plots depended on the total microbiome diversity at each site, which was highest at sites with high soil nutrients and plant biomass. We also found that experimentally adding soil nutrients and excluding herbivores produced concordant results across sites, increasing microbiome diversity by increasing plant biomass, which created a shaded microclimate. This demonstration of consistent responses of microbiome diversity across a wide range of host species and environmental conditions suggests the possibility of a general, predictive understanding of microbiome diversity.

## Body Mass Index Trajectories and Biomarkers of Cardiometabolic Risk in Children from Low-Income and Racially and Ethnically Diverse Households.
 16.06.2023, _JN de Brito, MA Pereira, AS Kelly, DJ Erickson, NE Sherwood, SM Mason, KA Loth, SA French, NG Evanoff, DR Dengel, AS Kunin-Batson_


Background: This study examined the associations between BMI trajectories and emerging cardiometabolic risk (CMR) in children living in low-income and racially and ethnically diverse households in the United States. Methods: Data were drawn from NET-Works randomized intervention trial and NET-Works 2 prospective follow-up study (N = 338). BMI was measured across 6 follow-up visits and biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) at the sixth visit. Group-based trajectory modeling identified child BMI trajectories. Adjusted multivariable linear regressions evaluated the associations between BMI trajectories and CMR. Results: We identified two BMI trajectories: 25% followed a trajectory of steep BMI increase, and 75% followed a moderate decreasing BMI trajectory over time. Relative to children in the moderate decreasing trajectory, children in the increasing trajectory had higher adjusted mean levels of C-reactive protein [CRP; 3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6 to 5.0], leptin (63.1; 95% CI: 44.3 to 81.8), triglycerides (35.4; 95% CI: 22.1 to 48.6), triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (1.2; 95% CI: 0.8 to 1.6), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C; 0.1; 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.2), fasting glucose (1.8; 0.1 to 3.5) and insulin (8.8; 95% CI: 6.5 to 11.0), overall CMR score (0.7; 95% CI: 0.5 to 0.9), and lower adiponectin (-1.3; 95% CI: -2.5 to -0.1) and HDL (-10.8; 95% CI: -14.3 to -7.4). Conclusions: Children with high BMIs early in childhood were more likely to maintain an accelerated BMI trajectory throughout childhood, which was associated with adverse CMR in pre-adolescence. To advance health equity and support children's healthy weight and cardiovascular health trajectories, public health efforts are needed to address persistent disparities in childhood obesity and CMR.

## Accelerated mineral bio-carbonation of coarse residue kimberlite material by inoculation with photosynthetic microbial mats.
 16.06.2023, _TR Jones, J Poitras, E Gagen, DJ Paterson, G Southam_


Microbiological weathering of coarse residue deposit (CRD) kimberlite produced by the Venetia Diamond Mine, Limpopo, South Africa enhanced mineral carbonation relative to untreated material. Cultures of photosynthetically enriched biofilm produced maximal carbonation conditions when mixed with kimberlite and incubated under near surface conditions. Interestingly, mineral carbonation also occurred in the dark, under water-saturated conditions. The examination of mineralized biofilms in ca. 150 µm-thick-sections using light microscopy, X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) and backscatter electron-scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry demonstrated that microbiological weathering aided in producing secondary calcium/magnesium carbonates on silicate grain boundaries. Calcium/magnesium sulphate(s) precipitated under vadose conditions demonstrating that evaporites formed upon drying. In this system, mineral carbonation was only observed in regions possessing bacteria, preserved within carbonate as cemented microcolonies. 16S rDNA molecular diversity of bacteria in kimberlite and in natural biofilms growing on kimberlite were dominated by Proteobacteria that are active in nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur cycling. Cyanobacteria based enrichment cultures provided with nitrogen &amp; phosphorus (nutrients) to enhance growth, possessed increased diversity of bacteria, with Proteobacteria re-establishing themselves as the dominant bacterial lineage when incubated under dark, vadose conditions consistent with natural kimberlite. Overall, 16S rDNA analyses revealed that weathered kimberlite hosts a diverse microbiome consistent with soils, metal cycling and hydrocarbon degradation. Enhanced weathering and carbonate-cemented microcolonies demonstrate that microorganisms are key to mineral carbonation of kimberlite.

## Methodological considerations for aqueous environmental RNA collection, preservation, and extraction.
 16.06.2023, _TS Jo_


Environmental RNA (eRNA) analysis is expected to infer species' physiological information (health status, developmental stage, and environmental stress response) and their distribution and composition more correctly than environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis. With the prospect of such eRNA applications, there is an increasing need for technological development for efficient eRNA detection because of its physicochemical instability. The present study conducted a series of aquarium experiments using zebrafish (Danio rerio) and validated the methodologies for capture, preservation, and extraction of eRNA in a water sample. In the eRNA extraction experiment, an approximately 1.5-fold increase in lysis buffer volume resulted in a more than sixfold increase in target eRNA concentration. In the eRNA capture experiment, although GF/F and GF/A filters yielded similar eRNA concentrations, a GF/A filter may be capable of passing through more volume of water samples and consequently collecting more eRNA particles, given the time required for water filtration. In the eRNA preservation experiment, the use of RNA stabilization reagent (RNAlater) allowed for stably preserving target eRNA on a filter sample at - 20 and even 4 °C for 6 days at least. Altogether, the findings enable the improvement of eRNA availability from the field and easily preserve eRNA samples without deep-freezing, which will contribute to the refinement of eRNA analysis for biological and physiological monitoring in aquatic ecosystems.
