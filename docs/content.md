The maintenance of human health is dependent on a symbiotic relationship between humans and associated bacteria. The diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes vary widely among body areas and among them the oral microbiome plays a key role. Significant changes in the oral cavity, predominantly at salivary and periodontal level, have been associated with changes in estrogen levels. However, whether the oral microbiome is affected by hormonal level alterations is understudied. Hence the main objective pursued by AMICA project was to characterize the oral microbiome (saliva) in healthy women through: profiling studies using "omics" technologies (NMR-based metabolomics, targeted lipidomics by LC-MS, metagenomics by NGS); SinglePlex ELISA assays; glycosidase activity analyses and bioinformatic analysis. For this purpose, thirty-nine medically healthy women aged 26-77 years (19 with menstrual cycle and 20 in menopause) were recruited. Participants completed questionnaires assessing detailed medical and medication history and demographic characteristics. Plasmatic and salivary levels of sexual hormones were assessed (FSH, estradiol, LH and progesteron) at day 3 and 14 for women with menstrual cycle and only once for women in menopause. Salivary microbiome composition was assessed through meta-taxonomic 16S sequencing and overall, the salivary microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle and in menopause. Targeted lipidomics and untargeted metabolomics profiling were assessed through the use of LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy technologies, respectively and significant changes in terms of metabolites were identified in saliva of post-menopausal women in comparison to cycle. Moreover, glycosyl hydrolase activities were screened and showed that the β-D-hexosaminidase activity was the most present among those analyzed. Although this study has not identified significant alterations in the composition of the oral microbiome, multiomics analysis have revealed a strong correlation between 2-AG and α-mannosidase. In conclusion, the use of a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the oral microbiome of healthy women provided some indication about microbiome-derived predictive biomarkers that could be used in the future for developing new strategies to help to re-establish the correct hormonal balance in post-menopausal women.

## Butyrate Ameliorates Insufficient Sleep-Induced Intestinal Mucosal Damage in Humans and Mice.

Insufficient sleep is a key factor in the occurrence of intestinal diseases. This study was performed to clarify how sleep deficiency mediates the intestinal microbiota, metabolite butyrate disturbance induces intestinal mucosal damage, and butyrate ameliorates it. A questionnaire was launched for sleep and intestinal health issues. Twenty-two healthy volunteers were interviewed, and the influence of insufficient sleep on the gut microbiota and metabolite composition was explored. Moreover, a 72-h sleep deprivation (SD) mouse model with or without butyrate supplementation was used to reveal the effect of butyrate on ameliorating small intestines damage caused by SD. The questionnaire survey of 534 college students showed that among 85.39% of the students who slept less than 7 h, 41.76% were suffering from various bowel disorders. High-throughput 16S rRNA pyrosequencing demonstrated that SD and sleep restriction (SR) resulted in downregulation of Faecalibacterium and butyrate abundance in the feces of college students. Furthermore, we observed that butyrate supplementation markedly reversed sleep-deprivation-induced small intestinal mucosal injury in mice. Meanwhile, butyrate supplementation inverted the SD-caused inflammation response and oxidative stress and the decline of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (p-GSK-3β), β-catenin, Nrf2, and cyclin D1 and the increase in histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and phospho-P65 (p-P65) proteins in the small intestines. Furthermore, in vitro, the ameliorative effects of butyrate were blocked by treatment with the HDAC3 agonist ITSA-1 and the Nrf2 antagonist ML385 and mimicked by treatment with the HDAC3 antagonist RGFP966 and p-P65 antagonist PDTC. Our study revealed that SD and SR downregulated butyrate production, further causing intestinal homeostasis dysfunction via the HDAC3-p-GSK-3β-β-catenin-Nrf2-NF-κB pathway. IMPORTANCE Radical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) induced by sleep deficiency is a serious global public health threat. Butyrate, a member of the short-chain fatty acids, exerts multiple effects on it. However, existing research focuses on injury to the colon caused by insufficient sleep, while the changes in the small intestines are often overlooked. This study focused on revealing the influence of insufficient sleep on the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites and further revealed the ameliorative effect of butyrate on sleep deprivation (SD)-induced small intestinal mucosal damage in human and mice. Our studies suggest that butyrate can be used as a probiotic to restore SD-induced IBD and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern the beneficial effects of butyrate.

## Multidisciplinary Perinatal Care in IBD.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] are often affected during their reproductive years and may have many perinatal queries that require the comprehensive perspectives of a multidisciplinary team [MDT]. The purpose of this topical review is to assess the scientific evidence and provide expert opinion related to nutritional, psychological, and supportive care of women and their infants throughout the prenatal, antenatal, and infant periods.

## A multi-omic brain gut microbiome signature differs between IBS subjects with different bowel habits.

Alterations of the brain-gut-microbiome system (BGM) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), yet bowel habit-specific alterations have not been elucidated. In this cross-sectional study, we apply a systems biology approach to characterize BGM patterns related to predominant bowel habit. Fecal samples and resting state fMRI were obtained from 102 premenopausal women (36 constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), 27 diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), 39 healthy controls (HCs)). Data integration analysis using latent components (DIABLO) was used to integrate data from the phenome, microbiome, metabolome, and resting-state connectome to predict HCs vs IBS-C vs IBS-D. Bloating and visceral sensitivity, distinguishing IBS from HC, were negatively associated with beneficial microbes and connectivity involving the orbitofrontal cortex. This suggests that gut interactions may generate aberrant central autonomic and descending pain pathways in IBS. The connection between IBS symptom duration, key microbes, and caudate connectivity may provide mechanistic insight to the chronicity of pain in IBS. IBS-D had higher levels of many key metabolites including tryptophan and phenylalanine, and increased connectivity between the sensorimotor and default mode networks; thus, suggesting an influence on diarrhea, self-related thoughts, and pain perception in IBS-D ('bottom-up' mechanism). IBS-C's microbiome and metabolome resembled HCs, but had increased connectivity in the default mode and salience networks compared to IBS-D, which may indicate importance of visceral signals, suggesting a more 'top-down' BGM pathophysiology. These BGM characteristics highlight possible mechanistic differences for variations in the IBS bowel habit phenome.
