## Effects of Tourniquet Application on Faster Recovery after Surgery and Ischemia-Reperfusion Post-Total Knee Arthroplasty, Cementation through Closure versus Full-Course and Nontourniquet Group.
 15.05.2021, _Q Cao, Q Wu, Y Liu, Z He, Y Cong, J Meng, J Zhao, N Bao_


Pneumatic tourniquets are used in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for surgical field visualization and improved cementation; however, their use is controversial. This study aimed to assess the effects of tourniquet application on faster recovery post-TKA. Our hypothesis was that inflammation and limb function would be similar with different tourniquet applications. A prospective randomized double-blinded trial assessed tourniquets effects on postoperative pain, swelling, and early outcome in TKA. In present study, 50 TKAs were enrolled in each group as follows: full course (FC), cementation through closure (CTC), and no tourniquet (NT), CTC as treatment group while FC and NT as control groups. Topical blood samples of 3 mL from the joint cavity and drainage bags were obtained at special time point. At last, all samples such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and myoglobin (Mb) were detected by ELISA. Active and passive range of motion (ROM) values, pain score by the visual analog scale (VAS), change of thigh circumference were recorded at special time point as well. In topical blood, the change of inflammatory factors, such as TNF-a, PTX3, CCL2, PGE2, SOD1, and Mb, was lower in CTC and NT groups than in FC group (p &lt; 0.01 and 0.05). Although VAS and ROM were comparable preoperatively in three groups (p &gt; 0.05), the perimeter growth rate was lower, pain scores (VAS) were reduced, and ROM values were improved in CTC and NT groups compared with FC group at T4, T5, and T6 postoperatively (p &lt; 0.01 and 0.05). Improved therapeutic outcome was observed in the CTC group, indicating patients should routinely undergo TKA with cementation through closure tourniquet application.

## Enhancing supports to children of incarcerated parents: Introducing trauma informed training to church mentors.
 14.05.2021, _K Hays, K Flores-Carter, J Costello, R Ellis_


A child who has a parent incarcerated is likely to experience a number of life challenges including school failure, poverty, substance abuse, and justice system involvement. The negative outcomes associated with having a parent incarcerated disproportionately expose children to adverse childhood events (ACE's) which have been associated with higher morbidity and mortality. However, engagement with caring adults who can provide both practical and spiritual mentorship can increase a child's resilience and buffer the impact of these negative outcomes. Church-based mentors have the capacity to provide support to this population when adequately trained in trauma-informed responses. This study describes Camp Agape California (CAC), a church-based mentoring program for children with an incarcerated parent. Specifically, this study describes the development and implementation of a trauma focused mentorship training purposed to equip church members to better meet the needs of this vulnerable population. Seventy-six volunteer mentors from various churches participated in the training and completed the post-training survey. Results suggest that the trauma informed training was effective at increasing knowledge and self-efficacy and was identified as being relevant to the mentor role. Implications for the utility of church-based mentorship for vulnerable populations are explored.

## Reconstruction of ancient microbial genomes from the human gut.
 13.05.2021, _MC Wibowo, Z Yang, M Borry, A Hübner, KD Huang, BT Tierney, S Zimmerman, F Barajas-Olmos, C Contreras-Cubas, H García-Ortiz, A Martínez-Hernández, JM Luber, P Kirstahler, T Blohm, FE Smiley, R Arnold, SA Ballal, SJ Pamp, J Russ, F Maixner, O Rota-Stabelli, N Segata, K Reinhard, L Orozco, C Warinner, M Snow, S LeBlanc, AD Kostic_


Loss of gut microbial diversity1-6 in industrial populations is associated with chronic diseases7, underscoring the importance of studying our ancestral gut microbiome. However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000-2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.

## The therapeutic role of lactobacillus and montelukast in combination with metformin in diabetes mellitus complications through modulation of gut microbiota and suppression of oxidative stress.
 15.05.2021, _AM El-Baz, A Shata, HM Hassan, MMA El-Sokkary, AE Khodir_


Male reproductive dysfunction is one of the overlooked findings of diabetes mellitus (DM) that deserves greater scientific attention. This study is designed to explore the therapeutic potential of metformin and montelukast, in combination with Lactobacillus, for modulation of intestinal flora and suppression of oxidative stress in testicular and liver damage in diabetic male rats. A DM model was induced by streptozotocin (STZ)which caused functional, biochemical, and inflammatory injuries to the testicular and liver tissues. The experimental panel included nine rat groups: normal control, normal control plus metformin, normal control plus montelukast, DM control, DM plus montelukast, DM plus a combination of metformin and Lactobacillus, DM plus a combination of montelukast and Lactobacillus, and DM plus a combination of metformin and montelukast. In parallel, clinical evaluation of microscopic examination scoring, and hepatic and testicular injuries, were evaluated. Biochemical markers including glucose level, lipid profile, inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-α) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), Caspase-3, and Bax proteins expressions were measured. The change in the microbiota abundance was investigated using conventional and real-time PCR. The current study revealed a significant difference in the relative abundance of microbiota, where DM is associated with an enormous increase of Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., E. coli, and Fusobacterium spp., and a significant decrease in Bifidobacteria spp., and Lactobacillus spp., in contrast with normal control. Metformin and montelukast, in combination with Lactobacillus, significantly reversed the testicular and liver damage caused by STZ. Moreover, the drugs significantly reduced the oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic activities induced by STZ.

## Mechanical biofilm disruption causes microbial and immunological shifts in periodontitis patients.
 11.05.2021, _W Johnston, BT Rosier, A Artacho, M Paterson, K Piela, C Delaney, JL Brown, G Ramage, A Mira, S Culshaw_


Periodontitis is characterized by subgingival biofilm dysbiosis, inflammation and tissue destruction. Current treatment involves mechanical biofilm disruption known as non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). This study sought to characterise the impact of treatment on microbial diversity and overall community, and the parallel impact on host inflammation in the oral cavity. Fourty-two periodontitis patients were included in this study, with periodontal clinical parameters, subgingival plaque and saliva samples collected at baseline and 90 days after treatment. Salivary cytokines were quantified, and subgingival plaque was analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing. After treatment, there were marked health-associated alterations in microbial composition and diversity, including differential abundance of 42 genera and 61 species. These changes were accompanied by substantial clinical improvement (pockets ≥ 5 mm, 27.50% to 9.00%, p &lt; 0.001) and a decrease in salivary IL-1β (p &lt; 0.001)-a putative marker of periodontal inflammation. Despite significant reductions in disease associated anaerobes, several genera (Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Tanenerella, Treponema) remained present and formed a distinct subnetwork associated with residual disease. Collectively, this study shows that current periodontal treatment results in partial restoration of a healthy microbial ecosystem, but features of biofilm dysbiosis and host inflammation remain in some patients, which were surprisingly independent of clinical response.

## The Complex Link between the Female Genital Microbiota, Genital Infections, and Inflammation.
 04.05.2021, _S Dabee, JS Passmore, R Heffron, HB Jaspan_


The female genital tract microbiota is part of a complex ecosystem influenced by several physiological, genetic, and behavioral factors. It is uniquely linked to a woman's mucosal immunity and plays a critical role in the regulation of genital inflammation. A vaginal microbiota characterized by a high abundance of lactobacilli and low overall bacterial diversity is associated with lower inflammation. On the other hand, a more diverse microbiota is linked to high mucosal inflammation levels, a compromised genital epithelial barrier, and an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections and other conditions. Several bacterial taxa such as Gardnerella spp., Prevotella spp., Sneathia spp., and Atopobium spp. are well known to have adverse effects; however, the definitive cause of this microbial dysbiosis is yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of this review is to discuss the multiple ways in which the microbiota influences the overall genital inflammatory milieu and to explore the causes and consequences of this inflammatory response. While there is abundant evidence linking a diverse genital microbiota to elevated inflammation, understanding the risk factors and mechanisms through which it affects genital health is essential. A robust appreciation of these factors is important for identifying effective prevention and treatment strategies.

## Urinary prostaglandin E2 as a biomarker for recurrent UTI in postmenopausal women.
 11.05.2021, _T Ebrahimzadeh, A Kuprasertkul, ML Neugent, KC Lutz, JL Fuentes, J Gadhvi, F Khan, C Zhang, BM Sharon, K Orth, Q Li, PE Zimmern, NJ De Nisco_


Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common adult bacterial infections and exhibits high recurrence rates, especially in postmenopausal women. Studies in mouse models suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-mediated inflammation sensitizes the bladder to recurrent UTI (rUTI). However, COX-2-mediated inflammation has not been robustly studied in human rUTI. We used human cohorts to assess urothelial COX-2 production and evaluate its product, PGE2, as a biomarker for rUTI in postmenopausal women. We found that the percentage of COX-2-positive cells was elevated in inflamed versus uninflamed bladder regions. We analyzed the performance of urinary PGE2 as a biomarker for rUTI in a controlled cohort of 92 postmenopausal women and PGE2 consistently outperformed all other tested clinical variables as a predictor of rUTI status. Furthermore, time-to-relapse analysis indicated that the risk of rUTI relapse was 3.6 times higher in women with above median urinary PGE2 levels than with below median levels. Taken together, these data suggest that urinary PGE2 may be a clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for rUTI in postmenopausal women.

Long-read sequencing in metagenomics facilitates the assembly of complete genomes out of complex microbial communities. These genomes include essential biologic information such as the ribosomal genes or the mobile genetic elements, which are usually missed with short-reads. We applied long-read metagenomics with Nanopore sequencing to retrieve high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (HQ MAGs) from a dog fecal sample.

## Perinatal exposure to tetracycline contributes to lasting developmental effects on offspring.
 14.05.2021, _EM Hill, CD Howard, TL Bale, E Jašarević_


For more than 30 years, the tetracycline on/off system of inducible gene expression has been leveraged to study disease mechanisms across many research areas, especially that of metabolism and neuroscience. This system requires acute or chronic exposure to tetracycline derivatives, such as doxycycline, to manipulate gene expression in a temporal and tissue-specific manner, with exposure often being restricted to gestational and early developmental windows. Despite evidence showing that early life antibiotic exposure has adverse effects on gut microbiota, metabolism, physiology, immunity and behavior, little is known regarding the lasting impact of doxycycline treatment on relevant outcomes in experimental offspring.

## Improving metagenomic binning results with overlapped bins using assembly graphs.
 08.05.2021, _VG Mallawaarachchi, AS Wickramarachchi, Y Lin_


Metagenomic sequencing allows us to study the structure, diversity and ecology in microbial communities without the necessity of obtaining pure cultures. In many metagenomics studies, the reads obtained from metagenomics sequencing are first assembled into longer contigs and these contigs are then binned into clusters of contigs where contigs in a cluster are expected to come from the same species. As different species may share common sequences in their genomes, one assembled contig may belong to multiple species. However, existing tools for binning contigs only support non-overlapped binning, i.e., each contig is assigned to at most one bin (species).

## A method for achieving complete microbial genomes and improving bins from metagenomics data.
 07.05.2021, _LM Lui, TN Nielsen, AP Arkin_


Metagenomics facilitates the study of the genetic information from uncultured microbes and complex microbial communities. Assembling complete genomes from metagenomics data is difficult because most samples have high organismal complexity and strain diversity. Some studies have attempted to extract complete bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes and often focus on species with circular genomes so they can help confirm completeness with circularity. However, less than 100 circularized bacterial and archaeal genomes have been assembled and published from metagenomics data despite the thousands of datasets that are available. Circularized genomes are important for (1) building a reference collection as scaffolds for future assemblies, (2) providing complete gene content of a genome, (3) confirming little or no contamination of a genome, (4) studying the genomic context and synteny of genes, and (5) linking protein coding genes to ribosomal RNA genes to aid metabolic inference in 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. We developed a semi-automated method called Jorg to help circularize small bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes using iterative assembly, binning, and read mapping. In addition, this method exposes potential misassemblies from k-mer based assemblies. We chose species of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) to focus our initial efforts because they have small genomes and are only known to have one ribosomal RNA operon. In addition to 34 circular CPR genomes, we present one circular Margulisbacteria genome, one circular Chloroflexi genome, and two circular megaphage genomes from 19 public and published datasets. We demonstrate findings that would likely be difficult without circularizing genomes, including that ribosomal genes are likely not operonic in the majority of CPR, and that some CPR harbor diverged forms of RNase P RNA. Code and a tutorial for this method is available at https://github.com/lmlui/Jorg and is available on the DOE Systems Biology KnowledgeBase as a beta app.

## Taxonomic annotation of 16S rRNA sequences of pig intestinal samples using MG-RAST and QIIME2 generated different microbiota compositions.
 11.05.2021, _J Lima, T Manning, KM Rutherford, ET Baima, RJ Dewhurst, P Walsh, R Roehe_


Environmental microbiome studies rely on fast and accurate bioinformatics tools to characterize the taxonomic composition of samples based on the 16S rRNA gene. MetaGenome Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (MG-RAST) and Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2) are two of the most popular tools available to perform this task. Their underlying algorithms differ in many aspects, and therefore the comparison of the pipelines provides insights into their best use and interpretation of the outcomes. Both of these bioinformatics tools are based on several specialized algorithms pipelined together, but whereas MG-RAST is a user-friendly webserver that clusters rRNA sequences based on their similarity to create Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU), QIIME2 employs DADA2 in the construction of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) by applying an error model that considers the abundance of each sequence and its similarity to other sequences. Taxonomic compositions obtained from the analyses of amplicon sequences of DNA from swine intestinal gut and faecal microbiota samples using MG-RAST and QIIME2 were compared at domain-, phylum-, family- and genus-levels in terms of richness, relative abundance and diversity. We found significant differences between the microbiota profiles obtained from each pipeline. At domain level, bacteria were relatively more abundant using QIIME2 than MG-RAST; at phylum level, seven taxa were identified exclusively by QIIME2; at family level, samples processed in QIIME2 showed higher evenness and richness (assessed by Shannon and Simpson indices). The genus-level compositions obtained from each pipeline were used in partial least squares-discriminant analyses (PLS-DA) to discriminate between sample collection sites (caecum, colon and faeces). The results showed that different genera were found to be significant for the models, based on the Variable Importance in Projection, e.g. when using sequencing data processed by MG-RAST, the three most important genera were Acetitomaculum, Ruminococcus and Methanosphaera, whereas when data was processed using QIIME2, these were Candidatus Methanomethylophilus, Sphaerochaeta and Anaerorhabdus. Furthermore, the application of differential filtering procedures before the PLS-DA revealed higher accuracy when using non-restricted datasets obtained from MG-RAST, whereas datasets obtained from QIIME2 resulted in more accurate discrimination of sample collection sites after removing genera with low relative abundances (&lt;1%) from the datasets. Our results highlight the differences in taxonomic compositions of samples obtained from the two separate pipelines, while underlining the impact on downstream analyses, such as biomarkers identification.

_Adolescent, Adult, Bayes Theorem, Child, Data Mining, Female, Humans, Hyoid Bone, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Laryngeal Cartilages, Male, Tomography, X-Ray Computed_
Objective To explore the feasibility of the CT image reconstruction of laryngeal cartilage and hyoid bone in adult age estimation using data mining methods. Methods The neck thin slice CT scans of 413 individuals aged 18 to &lt;80 years were collected and divided into test set and train set, randomly. According to grading methods such as TURK et al., all samples were graded comprehensively. The process of thyroid cartilage ossification was divided into 6 stages, the process of cricoid cartilage ossification was divided into 5 stages, and the synosteosis between the greater horn of hyoid and hyoid body was divided into 3 stages. Multiple linear regression model, support vector regression model, and Bayesian ridge regression model were developed for adult age estimation by scikit-learn 0.17 machine learning kit （Python language）. Leave-one-out cross-validation and the test set were used to further evaluate performance of the models. Results All indicators were moderately or poorly associated with age. The model with the highest accuracy in male age estimation was the support vector regression model, with a mean absolute error of 8.67 years, much higher than the other two models. The model with the highest accuracy in female adult age estimation was the support vector regression model, with a mean absolute error of 12.69 years, but its accuracy differences with the other two models had no statistical significance. Conclusion Data mining technology can improve the accuracy of adult age estimation, but the accuracy of adult age estimation based on laryngeal cartilage and hyoid bone is still not satisfactory, so it should be combined with other indicators in practice.

## Migrating from partial least squares discriminant analysis to artificial neural networks: a comparison of functionally equivalent visualisation and feature contribution tools using jupyter notebooks.
 30.12.2020, _KM Mendez, DI Broadhurst, SN Reinke_


_Discriminant Analysis, Least-Squares Analysis, Metabolomics, Neural Networks, Computer, Software_
Metabolomics data is commonly modelled multivariately using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Its success is primarily due to ease of interpretation, through projection to latent structures, and transparent assessment of feature importance using regression coefficients and Variable Importance in Projection scores. In recent years several non-linear machine learning (ML) methods have grown in popularity but with limited uptake essentially due to convoluted optimisation and interpretation. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a non-linear projection-based ML method that share a structural equivalence with PLS, and as such should be amenable to equivalent optimisation and interpretation methods.

## DNA methylation and gene expression integration in cardiovascular disease.
 14.04.2021, _G Palou-Márquez, I Subirana, L Nonell, A Fernández-Sanlés, R Elosua_


The integration of different layers of omics information is an opportunity to tackle the complexity of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and to identify new predictive biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. Our aim was to integrate DNA methylation and gene expression data in an effort to identify biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease risk in a community-based population. We accessed data from the Framingham Offspring Study, a cohort study with data on DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip; Illumina) and gene expression (Human Exon 1.0 ST Array; Affymetrix). Using the MOFA2 R package, we integrated these data to identify biomarkers related to the risk of presenting a cardiovascular event.

## Prediction of Dermal Exposure to Chemical Substances Using a Fluorescence Method within the SysDEA Project.
 15.05.2021, _R Franken, J Turkenburg, KM Kasiotis, N Shandilya, J Baan, AN Tsakirakis, I Chartzala, P Anastasiadou, K Machera, D Rother, M Roitzsch, U Poppek, J Meyer, U Schlüter, RM Gerritsen-Ebben, S Spaan_


Dermal exposure is an important exposure route for occupational exposure and risk assessment. A fluorescence method has been developed to quantify occupational dermal exposure based on a visualization technique, using Tinopal SWN as a fluorescent tracer. The method was developed within the framework of a large experimental study, the SysDEA project. In SysDEA, dermal exposure was measured with different methods for 10 simulated exposure situations by sampling powder and liquid formulations containing Tinopal SWN on coveralls and patches and subsequently chemically analysing them. For the fluorescence method, photographs of exposed volunteers who performed the experiments were taken inside a room which consisted of an optimized arrangement of several UV irradiating tube light brackets, reflective and non-reflective backgrounds for maximum light diffusion and a camera. Image processing analysis software processed these photographs to obtain corresponding light intensity in terms of summed pixel values. To be able to estimate the amount of Tinopal SWN, 25% of the measured data from the SysDEA experiments were used to calibrate by correlating the summed pixel values from the photographs to actual measured exposure values using a second order regression model. For spraying both high and low viscosity liquids, showing uniformly distributed exposure patterns, strong Pearson correlation coefficients (R &gt; 0.77) were observed. In contrast, the correlations were either inconsistently poor (R = -0.17 to 0.28 for pouring, rolling high viscosity liquid, manually handling objects immersed in low viscosity liquid and handling objects contaminated with powder), moderate (R = 0.73 for dumping of powder), or strong (R = 0.83 and 0.77 for rolling low viscosity liquid and manually handling objects immersed in high viscosity liquid). A model for spraying was developed and calibrated using 25% of the available experimental data for spraying and validated using the remaining 75%. Under given experimental conditions, the fluorescence method shows promising results and can be used for the quantification of dermal exposure for different body parts (excluding hands) for spraying-like scenarios that have a more uniform exposure pattern, but more research is needed for exposure scenarios with less uniform exposure patterns. For the estimation of exposure levels, the surface loading limit should be lower than 1.5░µg/cm2 (a lower limit could not be quantified based on experiments conducted in this study) on a large surface, like a coverall, which should be ideally perpendicular to the camera.

## Zein based-nanoparticles loaded botanical pesticides in pest control: An enzyme stimuli-responsive approach aiming sustainable agriculture.
 15.05.2021, _RA Monteiro, MC Camara, JL de Oliveira, EVR Campos, LB Carvalho, PLF Proença, M Guilger-Casagrande, R Lima, J do Nascimento, KC Gonçalves, RA Polanczyk, LF Fraceto_


Nanoencapsulation of biopesticides is an important strategy to increase the efficiency of these compounds, reducing losses and adverse effects on non-target organisms. This study describes the preparation and characterisation of zein nanoparticles containing the botanical compounds limonene and carvacrol, responsive to proteolytic enzymes present in the insects guts. The spherical nanoparticles, prepared by the anti-solvent precipitation method, presented in the nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) a concentration of 4.7 × 1012 ± 1.3 × 1011 particles.mL-1 and an average size of 125 ± 2 nm. The formulations showed stability over time, in addition to not being phytotoxic to Phaseolus vulgaris plants. In vivo tests demonstrated that formulations of zein nanoparticles containing botanical compounds showed higher mortality to Spodoptera frugiperda larvae. In addition, the FTIC probe (fluorescein isothiocyanate) showed wide distribution in the larvae midgut, as well as being identified in the feces. The trypsin enzyme, as well as the enzymatic extract from insects midgut, was effective in the degradation of nanoparticles containing the mixture of botanical compounds, significantly reducing the concentration of nanoparticles and the changes in size distribution. The zein degradation was confirmed by the disappearance of the protein band in the electrophoresis gel, by the formation of the lower molecular weight fragments and also by the greater release of FTIC after enzymes incubation. In this context, the synthesis of responsive nanoparticles has great potential for application in pest management, increasing the selectivity and specificity of the system and contributing to a more sustainable agriculture.

## Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: In-Depth Computational Approach Revealing Multiple Sulfur's Reduction Pathways and Hidden Li+ Storage Mechanisms for Extra Discharge Capacity.
 14.01.2021, _S Perez Beltran, PB Balbuena_


Like no other sulfur host material, polyacrylonitrile-derived sulfurized carbon (SPAN) promises improved electrochemical performance for lithium-sulfur batteries, based on its compatibility with carbonate solvents and ability to prevent self-discharge and shuttle effect. However, a complete understanding of the SPAN's lithiation mechanism is still missing because its structural features vary widely with synthesis conditions, and its electrochemical performance deviates from elemental sulfur. This study continues our research on the elucidation of the SPAN's structural characteristics and lithiation mechanisms via computational approaches. Our models reproduce most experimental data regarding carbon's graphitization level and conjugated ordering, sulfur-carbon covalent bonding, sulfur loading, and elemental composition. Our simulations emulate the discharge voltage observed in experiments for the first discharge, which reveals that sulfur follows multiple reduction pathways based on its interaction with the carbon backbone. Sulfur reduction takes place above 1.0 V vs Li/Li+ mostly in the SPAN-like material, with no long-chain lithium polysulfide formation. Below 1.0 V vs Li/Li+, the backbone's electrochemical activity occurs via multiple C-Li and N-Li interactions, mostly with edge carbon atoms and pyridinic nitrogen. Moreover, we identify Li+ binding sites throughout the graphitized backbone that might lead to prohibited energy costs for Li+ deintercalation, which may explain the irreversible capacity loss between the first and second discharges. This work improves understanding of lithiation mechanisms in sulfurized carbon, which is useful for rationally designing SPAN synthesis pathways tailored to increase sulfur loading and enhanced electrochemical performance.
