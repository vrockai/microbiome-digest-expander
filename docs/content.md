Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from gut bacteria are associated with protective roles in diseases ranging from obesity to colorectal cancers. Intake of microbially accessible dietary fibers (prebiotics) lead to varying effects on SCFA production in human studies, and gut microbial responses to nutritional interventions vary by individual. It is therefore possible that prebiotic therapies will require customizing to individuals.

## Oceanospirillales containing the DMSP lyase DddD are key utilisers of carbon from DMSP in coastal seawater.

Ubiquitous and diverse marine microorganisms utilise the abundant organosulfur molecule dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), the main precursor of the climate-active gas dimethylsulfide (DMS), as a source of carbon, sulfur and/or signalling molecules. However, it is currently difficult to discern which microbes actively catabolise DMSP in the environment, why they do so and the pathways used.

## Community structure of coral microbiomes is dependent on host morphology.

The importance of symbiosis has long been recognized on coral reefs, where the photosynthetic dinoflagellates of corals (Symbiodiniaceae) are the primary symbiont. Numerous studies have now shown that a diverse assemblage of prokaryotes also make-up part of the microbiome of corals. A subset of these prokaryotes is capable of fixing nitrogen, known as diazotrophs, and is also present in the microbiome of scleractinian corals where they have been shown to supplement the holobiont nitrogen budget. Here, an analysis of the microbiomes of 16 coral species collected from Australia, Curaçao, and Hawai'i using three different marker genes (16S rRNA, nifH, and ITS2) is presented. These data were used to examine the effects of biogeography, coral traits, and ecological life history characteristics on the composition and diversity of the microbiome in corals and their diazotrophic communities.

## Long-term nitrogen deposition enhances microbial capacities in soil carbon stabilization but reduces network complexity.

Anthropogenic activities have increased the inputs of atmospheric reactive nitrogen (N) into terrestrial ecosystems, affecting soil carbon stability and microbial communities. Previous studies have primarily examined the effects of nitrogen deposition on microbial taxonomy, enzymatic activities, and functional processes. Here, we examined various functional traits of soil microbial communities and how these traits are interrelated in a Mediterranean-type grassland administrated with 14 years of 7 g m-2 year-1 of N amendment, based on estimated atmospheric N deposition in areas within California, USA, by the end of the twenty-first century.

## Host-microbiota interaction-mediated resistance to inflammatory bowel disease in pigs.

Disease resistance phenotypes are associated with immune regulatory functions and immune tolerance and have implications for both the livestock industry and human health. Microbiota plays an essential role in regulating immunity and autoimmunity in the host organism, but the influence of host-microbiota interactions on disease resistance phenotypes remains unclear. Here, multiomics analysis was performed to identify potential regulatory mechanisms of disease resistance at both the microbiome and host levels in two pig breeds.
