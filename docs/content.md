## Microbiota and maintenance of skin barrier function.
 26.05.2022, _TA Harris-Tryon, EA Grice_


Human skin forms a protective barrier against the external environment and is our first line of defense against toxic, solar, and pathogenic insults. Our skin also defines our outward appearance, protects our internal tissues and organs, acts as a sensory interface, and prevents dehydration. Crucial to the skin's barrier function is the colonizing microbiota, which provides protection against pathogens, tunes immune responses, and fortifies the epithelium. Here we highlight recent advances in our understanding of how the microbiota mediates multiple facets of skin barrier function. We discuss recent insights into pathological host-microbiota interactions and implications for disorders of the skin and distant organs. Finally, we examine how microbiota-based mechanisms can be targeted to prevent or manage skin disorders and impaired wound healing.

## Local barriers configure systemic communications between the host and microbiota.
 26.05.2022, _Q Lu, TS Stappenbeck_


Associations between the dynamic community of microbes (the microbiota) and the host they colonize appear to be vital for ensuring host health. Microbe-host communication is actively maintained across physiological barriers of various body sites and is mediated by a range of bidirectional secreted proteins and small molecules. So far, a range of "omics" methods have succeeded in revealing the multiplicity of associations between members of a microbiota and a wide range of host processes and diseases. Although these advances point to possibilities for treating disease, there has not been much translational success thus far. We know little about which organisms are key contributors to host health, the importance of strain differences, and the activities of much of the chemical "soup" that is produced by the microbiota. Adding to this complexity are emerging hints of the role of interkingdom interactions between bacteria, phages, protozoa, and/or fungi in regulating the microbiota-host interactions. Functional approaches, although experimentally challenging, could be the next step to unlocking the power of the microbiota.

## Immune-microbe interactions early in life: A determinant of health and disease long term.
 26.05.2022, _P Brodin_


Research on newborn immunity has revealed the importance of cell ontogeny, feto-maternal tolerance, and the transfer of maternal antibodies. Less is known about postnatal adaptation to environmental exposures. The microbiome and its importance for health have been extensively studied, but it remains unclear how mutually beneficial relationships between commensal microbes and human cells first arise and are maintained throughout life. Such immune-microbe mutualism, and perturbations thereof, is most likely a root cause of increasing incidences of immune-mediated disorders such as allergies and autoimmunity across many industrialized nations during the past century. In this Review, I discuss our current understanding of immune development and propose that mismatches among ancestral, early-life, and adult environments can explain perturbations to immune-microbe interactions, immune dysregulation, and increased risks of immune-mediated diseases.

## Widespread stop-codon recoding in bacteriophages may regulate translation of lytic genes.
 26.05.2022, _AL Borges, YC Lou, R Sachdeva, B Al-Shayeb, PI Penev, AL Jaffe, S Lei, JM Santini, JF Banfield_


Bacteriophages (phages) are obligate parasites that use host bacterial translation machinery to produce viral proteins. However, some phages have alternative genetic codes with reassigned stop codons that are predicted to be incompatible with bacterial translation systems. We analysed 9,422 phage genomes and found that stop-codon recoding has evolved in diverse clades of phages that infect bacteria present in both human and animal gut microbiota. Recoded stop codons are particularly over-represented in phage structural and lysis genes. We propose that recoded stop codons might function to prevent premature production of late-stage proteins. Stop-codon recoding has evolved several times in closely related lineages, which suggests that adaptive recoding can occur over very short evolutionary timescales.

## Dynamic colonization of gut microbiota and its influencing factors among the breast-feeding infants during the first two years of life.
 27.05.2022, _P Li, X Chang, X Chen, T Tang, Y Liu, Y Shang, K Qi_


The maturation of infant gut microbiota has lifelong implications on health, which has been proposed as the major events during the first year of life. However, little is known about their dynamic colonization and influencing elements among the first two-year infancy as well as into the adulthood. So based on the 16S rRNA sequencing data among 30 healthy breast-feeding mother-infant pairs with normal ranges of growth and development indicators from birth to two years old, the dynamic colonization of gut microbiota and its influencing factors were discussed using this birth cohort. Among these, we identified that the diversity of gut microbiota was significantly increased from six-month to two-year subgroups. The significantly dynamic trends of gut microbiota at the phylum (genus) level were that the percents of Firmicutes (Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Enterococcus, Subdoligranulum, Agathobacter, unidentified_Erysipelotrichaceae, Staphylococcus, unidentified_Ruminococcaceae, and Fusicatenibacter), Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were increased, while Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium) and Proteobacteria (unidentified-Enterobacteriaceae and Klebsiella) were decreased with the increased ages from six months to two years old, which might simultaneously modulate the host pathways, such as the higher percents of chemoheterotrophy and fermentation, and lower percentages of nitrate_reduction, aerobic_chemoheterotrophy and so on. Furthermore, there were significant associations between maternal (milk microbiota, pre-pregnancy BMI, BMI increment during the pregnancy)/infant characteristics (BMI at birth and BMI gain), and the compositions of gut microbiota. However, no differences of gut microbiota were shown between the different sex and productive mode subgroups. Overall, the colonization of gut microbiota is significantly matured into the adulthood with the increased ages to two-years old and regulated by the above maternal/infant characteristics, which will provide a new direction for the host-gut microbiota interplay during the first two years of life.

## Lysophosphatidylserines derived from microbiota in Crohn's disease elicit pathological Th1 response.

Microbiota alteration and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cell overactivation are implicated in Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear how dysbiosis enhances Th1 responses, leading to intestinal inflammation. Here, we identified key metabolites derived from dysbiotic microbiota that induce enhanced Th1 responses and exaggerate colitis in mouse models. Patients with CD showed elevated lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) concentration in their feces, accompanied by a higher relative abundance of microbiota possessing a gene encoding the phospholipid-hydrolyzing enzyme phospholipase A. LysoPS induced metabolic reprogramming, thereby eliciting aberrant effector responses in both human and mouse IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells. Administration of LysoPS into two mouse colitis models promoted large intestinal inflammation. LysoPS-induced aggravation of colitis was impaired in mice lacking P2ry10 and P2ry10b, and their CD4+ T cells were hyporesponsive to LysoPS. Thus, our findings elaborate on the mechanism by which metabolites elevated in patients with CD harboring dysbiotic microbiota promote Th1-mediated intestinal pathology.

## Importance of crosstalk between the microbiota and the neuroimmune system for tissue homeostasis.
 27.05.2022, _K Li, K Ly, S Mehta, A Braithwaite_


The principal function of inflammation is cellular defence against 'danger signals' such as tissue injury and pathogen infection to maintain the homeostasis of the organism. The initiation and progression of inflammation are not autonomous as there is substantial evidence that inflammation is known to be strongly influenced by 'neuroimmune crosstalk', involving the production and expression of soluble signalling molecules that interact with cell surface receptors. In addition, microbiota have been found to be involved in the development and function of the nervous and immune systems and play an important role in health and disease. Herein, we provide an outline of the mechanisms of neuroimmune communication in the regulation of inflammation and immune response and then provide evidence for the involvement of microbiota in the development and functions of the host nervous and immune systems. It appears that the nervous and immune systems in multicellular organisms have co-evolved with the microbiota, such that all components are in communication to maximise the ability of the organism to adapt to a wide range of environmental stresses to maintain or restore tissue homeostasis.

## Dietary influences on symptomatic and non-symptomatic toxicities during cancer treatment: A narrative review.
 27.05.2022, _AJ Kim, DS Hong, GC George_


The general nutritional status of cancer patients could be a central determinant of cancer treatment-related toxicity and an indicator of cancer symptoms such as cancer-related cachexia and weight loss. This narrative scientific review covers the impact of dietary patterns (for example, Mediterranean diet, short-term fasting, ketogenic diet), dietary components (for example, fruits and vegetables, fish oils, turmeric/curcumin, dietary fiber, phytochemicals, vitamin/mineral dietary supplements), and the gut microbiota on symptoms, toxicities, and adverse events associated with cancer treatment. Although several studies have produced controversial or inconclusive results, some promising preclinical studies and initial clinical trials suggest that dietary interventions may alleviate certain cancer treatment-related symptoms and toxicities. Possible mechanisms by which dietary components may influence symptomatic and non-symptomatic toxicities during cancer treatment include through impacting inflammation, oxidative stress, muscle mass, cardiac health and regulating the gut microbiome. Current ongoing studies will continue to shed light on whether specific dietary interventions, with a special emphasis on the gut microbiota, are an effective method to improve cancer treatment outcomes. Future studies should examine the synergistic effects of combining different nutritional interventions and establish diet-related guidelines for cancer treatment.

## Comparative Analyses of Scylla olivacea Gut Microbiota Composition and Function Suggest the Capacity for Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Biosynthesis.
 26.05.2022, _NS Lau, SY Ting, KK Sam, J M, SC Wong, X Wu, K Waiho, H Fazhan, AC Shu-Chien_


Although numerous studies in aquatic organisms have linked lipid metabolism with intestinal bacterial structure, the possibility of the gut microbiota participating in the biosynthesis of beneficial long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) remains vague. We profiled the gut microbiota of the mud crab Scylla olivacea fed with either a LC-PUFA rich (FO) or a LC-PUFA-poor but C18-PUFA substrate-rich (LOCO) diet. Additionally, a diet with a similar profile as LOCO but with the inclusion of an antibiotic, oxolinic acid (LOCOAB), was also used to further demarcate the possibility of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in gut microbiota. Compared to diet FO treatment, crabs fed diet LOCO contained a higher proportion of Proteobacteria, notably two known taxonomy groups with PUFA biosynthesis capacity, Vibrio and Shewanella. Annotation of metagenomic datasets also revealed enrichment in the KEGG pathway of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and polyketide synthase-like system sequences with this diet. Intriguingly, diet LOCOAB impeded the presence of Vibrio and Shewanella and with it, the function of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. However, there was an increase in the function of short-chain fatty acid production, accompanied by a shift towards the abundance of phyla Bacteroidota and Spirochaetota. Collectively, these results exemplified bacterial communities and their corresponding PUFA biosynthesis pathways in the microbiota of an aquatic crustacean species.

## Global landscape of gut microbiome diversity and antibiotic resistomes across vertebrates.
 26.05.2022, _G Huang, Q Qu, M Wang, M Huang, W Zhou, F Wei_


Multiple factors influence gut microbiome diversity in vertebrate hosts. Most previous studies have only investigated specific factors and certain host species or taxa. However, a comprehensive assessment of the relative contributions of individual factors towards gut microbial diversity within a broader evolutionary context remains lacking. Here, 2202 16S rRNA gene sequencing samples of gut bacterial communities collected from 452 host species across seven classes were analyzed together to understand the factors broadly affecting vertebrate gut microbiomes across hosts with different diets, threatened status, captivity status, and habitat environmental factors. Among wild vertebrates, diet was most significantly associated with gut microbiome alpha diversity, while host phylogeny and diet were significantly associated with beta diversity, consistent with a previous study. Host threatened status and habitat environmental factors (e.g., geography and climate) were also associated with gut bacterial community beta diversity. Subsequent ecological modeling revealed a strong association between stochastic assembly processes and patterns of gut bacterial diversity among free-ranging vertebrates. In addition, metagenomic analysis of gut microbiomes from 62 captive vertebrates and sympatric humans revealed similar diversity and resistome profiles despite differences in host phylogeny, diet, and threatened status. These results thus suggest that captivity diminishes the effects of host phylogeny, diet, and threatened status on the diversity of vertebrate gut bacterial communities. The most overrepresented antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) observed in these samples are involved in resistance to β-lactams, aminoglycosides, and tetracycline. These results also revealed potential horizontal transfers of ARGs between captive animals and humans, thereby jointly threatening public health and vertebrate conservation. Together, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the diversity and resistomes of vertebrate gut microbiomes. These combined analyses will help guide future vertebrate conservation via the rational manipulation of microbial diversity and reducing antibiotic usage.

## Functional fermented probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics from non-dairy products: A perspective from nutraceutical.
 26.05.2022, _D Kumar, MK Lal, S Dutt, P Raigond, SS Changan, RK Tiwari, KN Chourasia, V Mangal, B Singh_


The current trend of health-conscious consumers and healthy food habits prompted researchers to explore developing food products with synbiotic benefits. Synbiotic foods have gained popularity in recent years due to their functional, nutritional, physiological, and therapeutic characteristics. Lactose intolerance, dyslipidaemia, and allergic milk proteins became the barriers in the development of dairy probiotics. The present scenario of an increase in the demand for vegetarian products led to a rise in the consumption of non-dairy probiotics. Prebiotics like, resistant starch, inulin, and polyphenols are selectively used by gut microbiota to enhance the selection and colonisation of probiotics bacteria. Probiotic's action mechanisms include the production of bacteriocins, peptides, short-chain fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins and other metabolites. Therefore, this review article explores the alternative sources of probiotics so it will help to an understanding of non-dairy based functional fermented foods for both pro and prebiotics. We also addressed dietary fibres in vegetables, fruits, and cereals are one of prospective prebiotics and highlighted the various methods for making non-dairy synbiotics based on dietary fibres, such as microencapsulation, freeze-drying, and spray drying.

Intestinal flora plays a critical role in the development of diet-induced obesity and related metabolic complications. Rutin is a natural flavonoid with potential prebiotic effects on regulating the intestinal flora composition that is beneficial for host health. Therefore, we hypothesized that rutin supplementation has beneficial effects on high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity and metabolic disorder through the modulation of intestinal flora in mice.

## Deciphering core phyllomicrobiome assemblage on rice genotypes grown in contrasting agroclimatic zones: implications for phyllomicrobiome engineering against blast disease.
 26.05.2022, _KP Sahu, A Kumar, K Sakthivel, B Reddy, M Kumar, A Patel, N Sheoran, S Gopalakrishnan, G Prakash, R Rathour, RK Gautam_


With its adapted microbial diversity, the phyllosphere contributes microbial metagenome to the plant holobiont and modulates a host of ecological functions. Phyllosphere microbiome (hereafter termed phyllomicrobiome) structure and the consequent ecological functions are vulnerable to a host of biotic (Genotypes) and abiotic factors (Environment) which is further compounded by agronomic transactions. However, the ecological forces driving the phyllomicrobiome assemblage and functions are among the most understudied aspects of plant biology. Despite the reports on the occurrence of diverse prokaryotic phyla such as Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Actinobacteria in phyllosphere habitat, the functional characterization leading to their utilization for agricultural sustainability is not yet explored. Currently, the metabarcoding by Next-Generation-Sequencing (mNGS) technique is a widely practised strategy for microbiome investigations. However, the validation of mNGS annotations by culturomics methods is not integrated with the microbiome exploration program. In the present study, we combined the mNGS with culturomics to decipher the core functional phyllomicrobiome of rice genotypes varying for blast disease resistance planted in two agroclimatic zones in India. There is a growing consensus among the various stakeholder of rice farming for an ecofriendly method of disease management. Here, we proposed phyllomicrobiome assisted rice blast management as a novel strategy for rice farming in the future.

## Indoor microbiome, microbial and plant metabolites, chemical compounds and asthma symptoms in junior high school students: a multicentre association study in Malaysia.
 26.05.2022, _Y Sun, M Zhang, Z Ou, Y Meng, Y Chen, R Lin, JH Hashim, Z Hashim, G Wieslander, Q Chen, D Norbäck, X Fu_


Indoor microbial exposure is associated with asthma, but the health effects of indoor metabolites and chemicals are not comprehensively assessed. Here, we collected classroom dust from 24 junior high schools in three geographically distanced areas in Malaysia, including Johor Bahru, Terengganu, and Penang, and conducted culture-independent high-throughput microbiome and untargeted metabolomics/chemical profilings. 1290 students were surveyed for asthma symptoms (wheeze). In each center, we found significant variation in the prevalence of wheeze among schools, which cannot be explained by personal characteristics and air pollutants. Large-scale microbial variations were observed between three centers; the potential protective bacteria were mainly from phylum Actinobacteria in Johor Bahru, Cyanobacteria in Terengganu, and Proteobacteria in Penang. In total, 2633 metabolites and chemicals were characterized. Many metabolites were enriched in low wheeze schools, including plant secondary metabolites flavonoids/isoflavonoids (isoliquiritigenin, formononetin, astragalin), indole and derivatives (indole, serotonin, 1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde), and others (biotin, chavicol). A neural-network analysis showed that the indole derivatives were co-occurring with the potential protective microbial taxa, including Actinomycetospora, Fischerella and Truepera, suggesting these microorganisms may pose health effects by releasing indole metabolites. A few synthetic chemicals were enriched in high wheeze schools, including pesticide (2(3H)-benzothiazolethione), fragrance (2-aminobenzoic acid, isovaleric acid), detergent and plastic (phthalic acid), and industrial material (4,4-sulfonyldiphenol). This is the first association study between high-throughput indoor chemical profiling and asthma symptoms. The consistent results from three centers indicate that indoor metabolites/chemicals could be a better indicator than indoor microbiome for environmental and health assessments, providing new insights for asthma prediction, prevention, and control.

## Comparative Analysis of Metagenomics and Metataxonomics for the Characterization of Vermicompost Microbiomes.
 27.05.2022, _M Pérez-Losada, DB Narayanan, AR Kolbe, I Ramos-Tapia, E Castro-Nallar, KA Crandall, J Domínguez_


The study of microbial communities or microbiotas in animals and environments is important because of their impact in a broad range of industrial applications, diseases and ecological roles. High throughput sequencing (HTS) is the best strategy to characterize microbial composition and function. Microbial profiles can be obtained either by shotgun sequencing of genomes, or through amplicon sequencing of target genes (e.g., 16S rRNA for bacteria and ITS for fungi). Here, we compared both HTS approaches at assessing taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial and fungal communities during vermicomposting of white grape marc. We applied specific HTS workflows to the same 12 microcosms, with and without earthworms, sampled at two distinct phases of the vermicomposting process occurring at 21 and 63 days. Metataxonomic profiles were inferred in DADA2, with bacterial metabolic pathways predicted via PICRUSt2. Metagenomic taxonomic profiles were inferred in PathoScope, while bacterial functional profiles were inferred in Humann2. Microbial profiles inferred by metagenomics and metataxonomics showed similarities and differences in composition, structure, and metabolic function at different taxonomic levels. Microbial composition and abundance estimated by both HTS approaches agreed reasonably well at the phylum level, but larger discrepancies were observed at lower taxonomic ranks. Shotgun HTS identified ~1.8 times more bacterial genera than 16S rRNA HTS, while ITS HTS identified two times more fungal genera than shotgun HTS. This is mainly a consequence of the difference in resolution and reference richness between amplicon and genome sequencing approaches and databases, respectively. Our study also revealed great differences and even opposite trends in alpha- and beta-diversity between amplicon and shotgun HTS. Interestingly, amplicon PICRUSt2-imputed functional repertoires overlapped ~50% with shotgun Humann2 profiles. Finally, both approaches indicated that although bacteria and fungi are the main drivers of biochemical decomposition, earthworms also play a key role in plant vermicomposting. In summary, our study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of metagenomics and metataxonomics and provides new insights on the vermicomposting of white grape marc. Since both approaches may target different biological aspects of the communities, combining them will provide a better understanding of the microbiotas under study.
