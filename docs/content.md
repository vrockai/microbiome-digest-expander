 29.03.2022, _SL La Rosa, MP Ostrowski, A Vera-Ponce de León, LS McKee, J Larsbrink, VG Eijsink, EC Lowe, EC Martens, PB Pope_


Microbiomes and their enzymes process many of the nutrients accessible in the gastrointestinal tract of bilaterians and play an essential role in host health and nutrition. In this review, we describe recent insights into nutrient processing in microbiomes across three exemplary yet contrasting gastrointestinal ecosystems (humans, ruminants and insects), with focus on bacterial mechanisms for the utilization of common and atypical dietary glycans as well as host-derived mucus glycans. In parallel, we discuss findings from multi-omic studies that have provided new perspectives on understanding glycan-dependent interactions and the complex food-webs of microbial populations in their natural habitat. Using key examples, we emphasize how increasing understanding of glycan processing by gut microbiomes can provide critical insights to assist 'microbiome reprogramming', a growing field that seeks to leverage diet to improve animal growth and host health.

## Prophylactic effects of hyperforin on anhedonia-like phenotype in chronic restrain stress model: A role of gut microbiota.
 29.03.2022, _Z Zhang, C Yao, M Li, LC Wang, W Huang, QJ Chen_


Anhedonia is the core symptom of depression, which largely reflects the therapeutic effect of depression. Hypericum perforatum is one of the most important antidepressant herb that has fewer side effects than traditional antidepressants. Considering the antibacterial effect of Hypericum perforatum, we verified whether this antidepressant activity was related to intestinal microbiomics. So we established anhedonia mouse model to explore the underlying treatment mechanism of hyperforin, the key antidepressant ingredient of Hypericum perforatum and to screen new psychobiotics based on hyperforin. It was found that hyperforin prevented anhedonia induced by chronic restraint stress in mice, and altered the richness and evenness of bacteria populations compared to stressed mice. Metastat analysis showed that Akkermansia muciniphila and Muribaculum intestinale were the bacterial species obviously affected by hyperforin, and their abundance in hyperforin treated group significantly increased. The results suggest that the effect of hyperforin on anhedonia may be partly assisted by Akkermansia muciniphila. These also indicate that Muribaculum intestinale may be another important intestinal bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of anhedonia symptom and depression.

Respiratory tract microbial dysbiosis can exacerbate inflammation and conversely inflammation may cause dysbiosis. Dysbiotic microbiome metabolites may lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hyperoxia and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interaction alters lung microbiome and metabolome, mediating BPD lung injury sequence.

## Microbiome applications for laying hen performance and egg production.
 29.03.2022, _SC Ricke, DK Dittoe, EG Olson_


Management of laying hens has undergone considerable changes in the commercial egg industry. Shifting commercial production from cage-based systems to cage-free has impacted the housing environment and created issues not previously encountered. Sources of microorganisms that become established in the early stages of layer chick development may originate from the hen and depend on the microbial ecology of the reproductive tract. Development of the layer hen GIT microbiota appears to occur in stages as the bird matures. Several factors can impact the development of the layer hen GIT, including pathogens, environment, and feed additives such as antibiotics. In this review, the current status of the laying hen GIT microbial consortia and factors that impact the development and function of these respective microbial populations will be discussed, as well as future research directions.

## Inhibitory Bacterial Diversity and Mucosome Function Differentiate Susceptibility of Appalachian Salamanders to Chytrid Fungal Infection.
 29.03.2022, _RR Jiménez, A Carfagno, L Linhoff, B Gratwicke, DC Woodhams, LS Chafran, MC Bletz, B Bishop, CR Muletz-Wolz_


Mucosal defenses are crucial in animals for protection against pathogens and predators. Host defense peptides (antimicrobial peptides, AMPs) as well as skin-associated microbes are key components of mucosal immunity, particularly in amphibians. We integrate microbiology, molecular biology, network-thinking, and proteomics to understand how host and microbially derived products on amphibian skin (referred to as the mucosome) serve as pathogen defenses. We studied defense mechanisms against chytrid pathogens, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal), in four salamander species with different Batrachochytrium susceptibilities. Bd infection was quantified using qPCR, mucosome function (i.e., ability to kill Bd or Bsal zoospores in vitro), skin bacterial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the role of Bd-inhibitory bacteria in microbial networks across all species. We explored the presence of candidate-AMPs in eastern newts and red-backed salamanders. Eastern newts had the highest Bd prevalence and mucosome function, while red-back salamanders had the lowest Bd prevalence and mucosome function, and two-lined salamanders and seal salamanders were intermediates. Salamanders with highest Bd infection intensity showed greater mucosome function. Bd infection prevalence significantly decreased as putative Bd-inhibitory bacterial richness and relative abundance increased on hosts. In co-occurrence networks, some putative Bd-inhibitory bacteria were found as hub-taxa, with red-backs having the highest proportion of protective hubs and positive associations related to putative Bd-inhibitory hub bacteria. We found more AMP candidates on salamanders with lower Bd susceptibility. These findings suggest that salamanders possess distinct innate mechanisms that affect chytrid fungi. IMPORTANCE How host mucosal defenses interact, and influence disease outcome is critical in understanding host defenses against pathogens. A more detailed understanding is needed of the interactions between the host and the functioning of its mucosal defenses in pathogen defense. This study investigates the variability of chytrid susceptibility in salamanders and the innate defenses each species possesses to mediate pathogens, thus advancing the knowledge toward a deeper understanding of the microbial ecology of skin-associated bacteria and contributing to the development of bioaugmentation strategies to mediate pathogen infection and disease. This study improves the understanding of complex immune defense mechanisms in salamanders and highlights the potential role of the mucosome to reduce the probability of Bd disease development and that putative protective bacteria may reduce likelihood of Bd infecting skin.

## Composition and short-term stability of gut microbiota in lean and spontaneously overweight healthy Labrador retriever dogs.
 29.03.2022, _J Söder, S Wernersson, K Höglund, R Hagman, S Lindåse, J Dicksved_


The gut microbiota and its metabolic end-products act in close collaboration with the nutrient metabolism of the animal. A relationship between excess adiposity and alterations in gut microbiota composition has been identified in humans and rodents, but data are scarce for overweight dogs. This study compared composition and temporal variations of gut microbiota in healthy lean and spontaneously overweight dogs. The analysis was based on three individual fresh faeces samples from each dog during a 10-day period. Twenty-seven healthy and intact male Labrador retriever dogs were included, 12 of which were classified as lean (body condition score (BCS) 4-5 on a 9-point scale) and 15 as overweight (BCS 6-8). Gut microbiota was analysed by Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.

## Alterations in common marmoset gut microbiome associated with duodenal strictures.
 29.03.2022, _A Sheh, SC Artim, MA Burns, JA Molina-Mora, MA Lee, J Dzink-Fox, S Muthupalani, JG Fox_


Chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases are the most common diseases in captive common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Despite standardized housing, diet and husbandry, a recently described gastrointestinal syndrome characterized by duodenal ulcers and strictures was observed in a subset of marmosets sourced from the New England Primate Research Center. As changes in the gut microbiome have been associated with GI diseases, the gut microbiome of 52 healthy, non-stricture marmosets (153 samples) were compared to the gut microbiome of 21 captive marmosets diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer/stricture (57 samples). No significant changes were observed using alpha diversity metrics, and while the community structure was significantly different when comparing beta diversity between healthy and stricture cases, the results were inconclusive due to differences observed in the dispersion of both datasets. Differences in the abundance of individual taxa using ANCOM, as stricture-associated dysbiosis was characterized by Anaerobiospirillum loss and Clostridium perfringens increases. To identify microbial and serum biomarkers that could help classify stricture cases, we developed models using machine learning algorithms (random forest, classification and regression trees, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors) to classify microbiome, serum chemistry or complete blood count (CBC) data. Random forest (RF) models were the most accurate models and correctly classified strictures using either 9 ASVs (amplicon sequence variants), 4 serum chemistry tests or 6 CBC tests. Based on the RF model and ANCOM results, C. perfringens was identified as a potential causative agent associated with the development of strictures. Clostridium perfringens was also isolated by microbiological culture in 4 of 9 duodenum samples from marmosets with histologically confirmed strictures. Due to the enrichment of C. perfringens in situ, we analyzed frozen duodenal tissues using both 16S microbiome profiling and RNAseq. Microbiome analysis of the duodenal tissues of 29 marmosets from the MIT colony confirmed an increased abundance of Clostridium in stricture cases. Comparison of the duodenal gene expression from stricture and non-stricture marmosets found enrichment of genes associated with intestinal absorption, and lipid metabolism, localization, and transport in stricture cases. Using machine learning, we identified increased abundance of C. perfringens, as a potential causative agent of GI disease and intestinal strictures in marmosets.

## Spatial organization of the kelp microbiome at micron scales.
 29.03.2022, _ST Ramírez-Puebla, BL Weigel, L Jack, C Schlundt, CA Pfister, JL Mark Welch_


Elucidating the spatial structure of host-associated microbial communities is essential for understanding taxon-taxon interactions within the microbiota and between microbiota and host. Macroalgae are colonized by complex microbial communities, suggesting intimate symbioses that likely play key roles in both macroalgal and bacterial biology, yet little is known about the spatial organization of microbes associated with macroalgae. Canopy-forming kelp are ecologically significant, fixing teragrams of carbon per year in coastal kelp forest ecosystems. We characterized the micron-scale spatial organization of bacterial communities on blades of the kelp Nereocystis luetkeana using fluorescence in situ hybridization and spectral imaging with a probe set combining phylum-, class-, and genus-level probes to localize and identify &gt; 90% of the microbial community.

## Metagenomics reveals global-scale contrasts in nitrogen cycling and cyanobacterial light-harvesting mechanisms in glacier cryoconite.
 29.03.2022, _T Murakami, N Takeuchi, H Mori, Y Hirose, A Edwards, T Irvine-Fynn, Z Li, S Ishii, T Segawa_


Cryoconite granules are mineral-microbial aggregates found on glacier surfaces worldwide and are hotspots of biogeochemical reactions in glacier ecosystems. However, despite their importance within glacier ecosystems, the geographical diversity of taxonomic assemblages and metabolic potential of cryoconite communities around the globe remain unclear. In particular, the genomic content of cryoconite communities on Asia's high mountain glaciers, which represent a substantial portion of Earth's ice masses, has rarely been reported. Therefore, in this study, to elucidate the taxonomic and ecological diversities of cryoconite bacterial consortia on a global scale, we conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing of cryoconite acquired from a range of geographical areas comprising Polar (Arctic and Antarctic) and Asian alpine regions.

## Multikingdom interactions govern the microbiome in subterranean cultural heritage sites.
 28.03.2022, _W Liu, X Zhou, T Jin, Y Li, B Wu, D Yu, Z Yu, B Su, R Chen, Y Feng, M Delgado-Baquerizo_


SignificanceThe conservation of historical relics against microbial biodeterioration is critical to preserving cultural heritages. One major challenge is our limited understanding of microorganisms' dispersal, colonization, and persistence on relics after excavation and opening to external environments. Here, we investigate the ecological and physiological profiles of the microbiome within and outside the Dahuting Han Dynasty Tomb with a 1,800-y history. Actinobacteria dominate the microbiome in this tomb. Via interkingdom signaling mutualism, springtails carry Actinobacteria as one possible source into the tomb from surrounding environments. Subsequently, Actinobacteria produce cellulases combined with antimicrobial substances, which helps them to colonize and thrive in the tomb via intrakingdom competition. Our findings unravel the ecology of the microbiomes colonizing historical relics and provide help for conservation practices.

## Indoor green can modify the indoor dust microbial communities.
 29.03.2022, _Y Dockx, M Täubel, EM Bijnens, K Witters, M Valkonen, B Jayaprakash, J Hogervorst, TS Nawrot, L Casas_


Little is known about the potential role of indoor plants in shaping the indoor microbiota. Within the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort, we collected settled dust and performed 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing and qPCR measurements to characterize the indoor microbiota, including bacterial and fungal loads and Chao1 richness, Shannon, and Simpson diversity indices. For 155 households, we obtained information on the number of indoor plants. We performed linear regression models adjusted for several a priori chosen covariables. Overall, an increase in indoor plants and density was associated with increased microbial diversity, but not load. For example, we found an increase of 64 (95%CI:3;125) and 26 (95%CI:4;48) units of bacterial and fungal taxa richness, respectively, in households with more than three plants compared to no plants. Our results support the hypothesis that indoor plants can enrich indoor microbial diversity, while impacts on microbial loads are not obvious.

## Metagenomic strain detection with SameStr: identification of a persisting core gut microbiota transferable by fecal transplantation.
 29.03.2022, _D Podlesny, C Arze, E Dörner, S Verma, S Dutta, J Walter, WF Fricke_


The understanding of how microbiomes assemble, function, and evolve requires metagenomic tools that can resolve microbiota compositions at the strain level. However, the identification and tracking of microbial strains in fecal metagenomes is challenging and available tools variably classify subspecies lineages, which affects their applicability to infer microbial persistence and transfer.
