The gut microbiome and iron status are known to play a role in the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although their complex interaction remains unclear.

## A Meta-analysis of Gut Microbiota in Children with Autism.
 05.05.2021, _P Andreo-Martínez, M Rubio-Aparicio, J Sánchez-Meca, A Veas, AE Martínez-González_


Previous studies have reported dysbiosis in the gut microbiota (GM) of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which may be a determining factor on child development through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, it is not clear if there is a specific group of dysbiotic bacteria in ASD. The aim of this study was to carry out a meta-analysis on the studies that analyze GM in children with ASD. 18 studies fulfilled our selection criteria. Our results showed a lower relative abundance of Streptococcus (SMD+ = - 0.999; 95% CI - 1.549, - 0.449) and Bifidobacterium genera (SMD+ = - 0.513; 95% CI - 0.953, - 0.073) in children with ASD. Overall, the Bifidobacterium genera is involved. However, differences found between studies are attributed to factors such as reporting bias.

## Deviations in the gut microbiota of neonates affected by maternal group B Streptococcus colonization.
 09.05.2021, _YF Li, XL Gong, SX Chen, K Wang, YH Jiang_


Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection is the leading cause of septicemia, meningitis, and pneumonia in neonates. Aberrant gut colonization in early life may predispose children to various diseases in adulthood. However, the associations between gut microbial changes and GBS colonization is still unclear.

## Cage environment regulates gut microbiota independent of toll-like receptors.

The gut microbiome orchestrates epithelial homeostasis and both local and remote immunological responses. Critical to these regulatory interactions are innate immune receptors termed toll-like receptors. Studies to date have implicated innate immunity and toll-like receptors in shaping key features of the gut microbiome. However, a variety of biological and environmental variables are also implicated in determining gut microbiota composition. In this report, we hypothesized that co-housing and environment dominated the regulation of gut microbiota in animal models independent of innate immunity. To determine the importance of these variables, innate immunity or environment in shaping gut microbiota, we used a randomized co-housing strategy and transgenic TLR-deficient mice. We have found that mice co-housed together by genotype exhibited limited changes over time in the composition of gut microbiota. However, in mice randomized to cage, we report extensive changes in gut microbiota, independent of TLR function whereby the fecal microbiota of TLR-deficient mice converge with wild type. TLR5-deficient mice in these experiments exhibit a greater susceptibility for comparative changes in microbiota to other TLR-deficient mice and wild type mice. Our work has broad implications for the study of innate immunity and host-microbiota interactions. Given the profound impact that gut dysbiosis may have on immunity, this report highlights the potential impact of co-housing on gut microbiota and indices of inflammation as outcomes in biological models of infectious or inflammatory disease.

## Changes of gut microbiome composition and metabolites associated with hypertensive heart failure rats.
 09.05.2021, _L Li, SJ Zhong, SY Hu, B Cheng, H Qiu, ZX Hu_


The potential role of the gut microbiome (GM) in heart failure (HF) had recently been revealed. However, the underlying mechanisms of the GM and fecal metabolome in HF have not been characterized. The Dahl salt-sensitive rat model of hypertensive heart failure (H-HF) was used to study the clinical symptoms and characteristics. To elucidate the pathogenesis of HF, we combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics to analyze gut microbial compositions and fecal metabolomic profiles of rats with H-HF.

## Specific and conserved patterns of microbiota-structuring by maize benzoxazinoids in the field.
 08.05.2021, _S Cadot, H Guan, M Bigalke, JC Walser, G Jander, M Erb, MGA van der Heijden, K Schlaeppi_


Plants influence their root and rhizosphere microbial communities through the secretion of root exudates. However, how specific classes of root exudate compounds impact the assembly of root-associated microbiotas is not well understood, especially not under realistic field conditions. Maize roots secrete benzoxazinoids (BXs), a class of indole-derived defense compounds, and thereby impact the assembly of their microbiota. Here, we investigated the broader impacts of BX exudation on root and rhizosphere microbiotas of adult maize plants grown under natural conditions at different field locations in Europe and the USA. We examined the microbiotas of BX-producing and multiple BX-defective lines in two genetic backgrounds across three soils with different properties.
