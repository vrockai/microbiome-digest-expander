The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection leads to a severe respiratory illness and alters the gut microbiota, which dynamically interacts with the human immune system. Microbiota alterations include decreased levels of beneficial bacteria and augmentation of opportunistic pathogens. Here, we describe critical factors affecting the microbiota in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. These include, such as gut microbiota imbalance and gastrointestinal symptoms, the pattern of altered gut microbiota composition in COVID-19 patients, and crosstalk between the microbiome and the gut-lung axis/gut-brain-lung axis. Moreover, we have illustrated the hypoxia state in COVID-19 associated gut microbiota alteration. The role of ACE2 in the digestive system, and control of its expression using the gut microbiota is discussed, highlighting the interactions between the lungs, the gut, and the brain during COVID-19 infection. Similarly, we address the gut microbiota in elderly or co-morbid patients as well as gut microbiota dysbiosis of in severe COVID-19. Several clinical trials to understand the role of probiotics in COVID-19 patients are listed in this review. Augmented inflammation is one of the major driving forces for COVID-19 symptoms and gut microbiome disruption and is associated with disease severity. However, understanding the role of the gut microbiota in immune modulation during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help improve therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment.

## Characterization of interactions of dietary cholesterol with the murine and human gut microbiome.

Consumption of dietary lipids, such as cholesterol, modulates the gut microbiome with consequences for host health through the production of microbiome-derived metabolites. Despite the implications for host metabolism, a limited number of specific interactions of the gut microbiome with diet-derived lipids have been characterized. This is partially because obtaining species-level resolution of the responsible taxa can be challenging and additional approaches are needed to identify health-relevant metabolites produced from cholesterol-microbiome interactions. Here we performed bio-orthogonal labelling sort sequence spectrometry, a click chemistry based workflow, to profile cholesterol-specific host-microbe interactions. Mice were exposed to an alkyne-functionalized variant of cholesterol and 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing of faecal samples identified diet-derived cholesterol-interacting microbes from the genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus and Parabacteroides. Shotgun metagenomic analysis provided species-level resolution of diet-derived cholesterol-interacting microbes with enrichment of bile acid-like and sulfotransferase-like activities. Using untargeted metabolomics, we identify that cholesterol is converted to cholesterol sulfate in a Bacteroides-specific manner via the enzyme BT_0416. Mice monocolonized with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron lacking Bt_0416 showed altered host cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate compared with wild-type mice, identifying a previously uncharacterized microbiome-transformation of cholesterol and a mechanism for microbiome-dependent contributions to host phenotype. Moreover, identification of a cholesterol-responsive sulfotransferase in Bacteroides suggests diet-dependent mechanisms for altering microbiome-specific cholesterol metabolism. Overall, our work identifies numerous cholesterol-interacting microbes with implications for more precise microbiome-conscious regulation of host cholesterol homeostasis.

## Gut-derived bacterial flagellin induces beta-cell inflammation and dysfunction.

Hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are caused by failure of pancreatic beta cells. The role of the gut microbiota in T2D has been studied, but causal links remain enigmatic. Obese individuals with or without T2D were included from two independent Dutch cohorts. Human data were translated in vitro and in vivo by using pancreatic islets from C57BL6/J mice and by injecting flagellin into obese mice. Flagellin is part of the bacterial locomotor appendage flagellum, present in gut bacteria including Enterobacteriaceae, which we show to be more abundant in the gut of individuals with T2D. Subsequently, flagellin induces a pro-inflammatory response in pancreatic islets mediated by the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-5 expressed on resident islet macrophages. This inflammatory response is associated with beta-cell dysfunction, characterized by reduced insulin gene expression, impaired proinsulin processing and stress-induced insulin hypersecretion in vitro and in vivo in mice. We postulate that increased systemically disseminated flagellin in T2D is a contributing factor to beta-cell failure in time and represents a novel therapeutic target.
