Characterizing complex microbial communities with single-cell resolution has been a long-standing goal of microbiology. We present Microbe-seq, a high-throughput method that yields the genomes of individual microbes from complex microbial communities. We encapsulate individual microbes in droplets with microfluidics and liberate their DNA, which we then amplify, tag with droplet-specific barcodes, and sequence. We explore the human gut microbiome, sequencing more than 20,000 microbial single-amplified genomes (SAGs) from a single human donor and coassembling genomes of almost 100 bacterial species, including several with multiple subspecies strains. We use these genomes to probe microbial interactions, reconstructing the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) network and observing HGT between 92 species pairs; we also identify a significant in vivo host-phage association between crAssphage and one strain of Bacteroides vulgatus. Microbe-seq contributes high-throughput culture-free capabilities to investigate genomic blueprints of complex microbial communities with single-microbe resolution.

## Gut microbiome and autoimmune disorders.
 02.06.2022, _WA Shaheen, MN Quraishi, TH Iqbal_


Autoimmune diseases have long been known to share a common pathogenesis involving a dysregulated immune system with failure to recognize self from non-self antigens. This immune dysregulation is now increasingly understood to be induced by environmental triggers in genetically predisposed individuals. Although several external environmental triggers have been defined in different autoimmune diseases, much attention is being paid to the role of the internal micro-environment occupied by the microbiome which was once termed "the forgotten organ". In this regard, the gut microbiome, serving as an intermediary between some of those external environmental effectors and the immune system helps programming of the immune system to be tolerant to innocent external and self antigens. However, in the presence of perturbed gut microbiota (dysbiosis), the immune system could be erroneously directed in favor of pro-inflammatory pathways to instigate different autoimmune processes. An accumulating body of evidence, including both experimental and human studies (observational and interventional) points to a role of gut microbiome in different autoimmune diseases. Such evidence could provide a rationale for gut microbiome manipulation with therapeutic and even preventative intents in patients with established or predisposed to autoimmune diseases respectively. Perturbations of the gut microbiome have been delineated in some immune mediated diseases, IBD in particular. However, such patterns of disturbance (microbiome signatures) and related pathogenetic roles of the gut microbiome are context dependent and cannot be generalized in the same exact way to other autoimmune disorders and the contribution of gut microbiome to different disease phenotypes has to be precisely defined. In this review, we revise the evidence for a role of gut microbiome in various autoimmune diseases and possible mechanisms mediating such a role.

## Gut microbial metabolites in Parkinson's disease: Association with lifestyle, disease characteristics, and treatment status.
 02.06.2022, _RM Voigt, Z Wang, JM Brown, PA Engen, A Naqib, CG Goetz, DA Hall, LV Metman, M Shaikh, CB Forsyth, A Keshavarzian_


There is growing appreciation of the importance of the intestinal microbiota in Parkinson's disease (PD), and one potential mechanism by which the intestinal microbiota can communicate with the brain is via bacteria-derived metabolites. In this study, plasma levels of bacterial-derived metabolites including trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), short chain fatty acids (SCFA), the branched chain fatty acid isovalerate, succinate, and lactate were evaluated in PD subjects (treatment naïve and treated) which were compared to (1) population controls, (2) spousal / household controls (similar lifestyle to PD subjects), and (3) subjects with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Analyses revealed an increase in the TMAO pathway in PD subjects which was independent of medication status, disease characteristics, and lifestyle. Lactic acid was decreased in treated PD subjects, succinic acid positively correlated with disease severity, and the ratio of pro-inflammatory TMAO to the putative anti-inflammatory metabolite butyric acid was significantly higher in PD subjects compared to controls indicating a pro-inflammatory shift in the metabolite profile in PD subjects. Finally, acetic and butyric acid were different between PD and MSA subjects indicating that metabolites may differentiate these synucleinopathies. In summary, (1) TMAO is elevated in PD subjects, a phenomenon independent of disease characteristics, treatment status, and lifestyle and (2) metabolites may differentiate PD and MSA subjects. Additional studies to understand the potential of TMAO and other bacterial metabolites to serve as a biomarker or therapeutic targets are warranted.

## Mechanistic insights into accelerated α-synuclein aggregation mediated by human microbiome-associated functional amyloids.
 02.06.2022, _SS Bhoite, Y Han, BT Ruotolo, MR Chapman_


The gut microbiome has been shown to have key implications in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The E. coli functional amyloid CsgA is known to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation in vitro and induce PD symptoms in mice. However, the mechanism governing CsgA-mediated acceleration of α-synuclein aggregation is unclear. Here, we show that CsgA can form stable homodimeric species that correlate with faster α-synuclein amyloid aggregation. Furthermore, we identify and characterize new CsgA homologs encoded by bacteria present in the human microbiome. These CsgA homologs display diverse aggregation kinetics, and they differ in their ability to modulate α-synuclein aggregation. Remarkably, we demonstrate that slowing down CsgA aggregation leads to increased acceleration of α-synuclein aggregation suggesting that the intrinsic amyloidogenicity of gut bacterial CsgA homologs affects their ability to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation. Finally, we identify a complex between CsgA and α-synuclein that functions as a platform to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our work reveals complex interplay between bacterial amyloids and α-synuclein that better informs our understanding of PD causation.

## Gut bacterial isoamylamine promotes age-related cognitive dysfunction by promoting microglial cell death.
 02.06.2022, _Y Teng, J Mu, F Xu, X Zhang, MK Sriwastva, QM Liu, X Li, C Lei, K Sundaram, X Hu, L Zhang, JW Park, JY Hwang, EC Rouchka, X Zhang, J Yan, ML Merchant, HG Zhang_


The intestinal microbiome releases a plethora of small molecules. Here, we show that the Ruminococcaceae metabolite isoamylamine (IAA) is enriched in aged mice and elderly people, whereas Ruminococcaceae phages, belonging to the Myoviridae family, are reduced. Young mice orally administered IAA show cognitive decline, whereas Myoviridae phage administration reduces IAA levels. Mechanistically, IAA promotes apoptosis of microglial cells by recruiting the transcriptional regulator p53 to the S100A8 promoter region. Specifically, IAA recognizes and binds the S100A8 promoter region to facilitate the unwinding of its self-complementary hairpin structure, thereby subsequently enabling p53 to access the S100A8 promoter and enhance S100A8 expression. Thus, our findings provide evidence that small molecules released from the gut microbiome can directly bind genomic DNA and act as transcriptional coregulators by recruiting transcription factors. These findings further unveil a molecular mechanism that connects gut metabolism to gene expression in the brain with implications for disease development.

## Exploring the Ecological Effects of Naturally Antibiotic-Insensitive Bifidobacteria in the Recovery of the Resilience of the Gut Microbiota during and after Antibiotic Treatment.
 02.06.2022, _C Argentini, L Mancabelli, G Alessandri, C Tarracchini, M Barbetti, L Carnevali, G Longhi, A Viappiani, R Anzalone, C Milani, A Sgoifo, D van Sinderen, M Ventura, F Turroni_


Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) is the most widely used antibiotic, being frequently prescribed to infants. Particular members of the genus Bifidobacterium are among the first microbial colonizers of the infant gut, and it has been demonstrated that they exhibit various activities beneficial for their human host, including promotion/maintenance of the human gut microbiota homeostasis. It has been shown that natural resistance of bifidobacteria to AMC is limited to a small number of strains. In the current study, we investigated the mitigation effects of AMC-resistant bifidobacteria in diversity preservation of the gut microbiota during AMC treatment. To this end, an in vitro coculture experiment based on infant fecal samples and an in vivo study employing a rodent model were performed. The results confirmed the ability of AMC-resistant bifidobacterial strains to bolster gut microbiota resilience, while specific covariance analysis revealed strain-specific and variable impacts on the microbiota composition by individual bifidobacterial taxa. IMPORTANCE The first microbial colonizers of the infant gut are members of the genus Bifidobacterium, which exhibit different activities beneficial to their host. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) is the most frequently prescribed antibiotic during infancy, and few strains of bifidobacteria are known to show a natural resistance to this antibiotic. In the present work, we evaluated the possible positive effects of AMC-resistant bifidobacterial strains in maintaining gut microbiota diversity during AMC exposure, performing an in vitro and in vivo experiment based on an infant gut model and a rodent model, respectively. Our results suggested the ability of AMC-resistant bifidobacterial strains to support gut microbiota restoration.

_Bacteria, Fungi, Microbiota, Proteobacteria, Seasons_
Here, the taxonomical composition and seasonal dynamics of airborne microbial communities were described in the urban city of Lanzhou, Northwest China. Year-long samples were studied in two filter membranes (Quartz and PTFE). Higher microbial loads were reported in the PTFE than in the quartz filter. Onefold decrease was reported in bacterial loads in spring and summer than winter and autumn for both filters. The fungal loadings were lowest during winter and highest during autumn, followed by summer. The microbial communities included Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota as major components. Maximum abundance of the members from Gammaproteobacteria, Coriobacteria and Clostridia were studied in all seasons on PTFE membrane, followed by, Erysipelotrichia, Negativicutes and Fusobacteria. Members of Actinobacteria and Bacilli showed higher abundance in spring and winter, with a small proportion during autumn. Members of Clostridia, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, and Actinobacteria showed maximum abundance on the quartz filter in all the seasons. Similarly, on the PTFE, fungi including Dothideomycetes and Agaricomycetes were dominant, followed by Saccharomycetes during summer and winter. The result showed that PM2.5, SO42-, NO2-, Na+, EC, and OC are important environmental parameters influencing the seasonal microbial community. However, the relation of the microbiome with the environment cannot be confidently defined because the environmental factors are changeable and yet interrelated.

## SAMBA: A Multicolor Digital Melting PCR Platform for Rapid Microbiome Profiling.
 02.06.2022, _Y Luo, X Cui, E Cheruba, YK Chua, C Ng, RZ Tan, KK Tan, LF Cheow_


During the past decade, breakthroughs in sequencing technology have provided the basis for studies of the myriad ways in which microbial communities in and on the human body influence human health and disease. In almost every medical specialty, there is now a growing interest in accurate and quantitative profiling of the microbiota for use in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, the current next-generation sequencing approach for microbiome profiling is costly, requires laborious library preparation, and is challenging to scale up for routine diagnostics. Split, Amplify, and Melt analysis of BActeria-community (SAMBA), a novel multicolor digital melting polymerase chain reaction platform with unprecedented multiplexing capability is presented, and the capability to distinguish and quantify 16 bacteria species in mixtures is demonstrated. Subsequently, SAMBA is applied to measure the compositions of bacteria in the gut microbiome to identify microbial dysbiosis related to colorectal cancer. This rapid, low cost, and high-throughput approach will enable the implementation of microbiome diagnostics in clinical laboratories and routine medical practice.
