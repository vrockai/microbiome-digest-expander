## PTHrP, A Biomarker for CNS Metastasis in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer and Selection for Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Node-Negative Disease.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by poor prognosis and lack of targeted therapies and biomarkers to guide decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer and involved in proliferation and metastasis, two hallmarks of poor prognosis for node-negative breast cancer. We investigated the prognostic value of PTHrP with respect to organ-specific metastasis and nodal status in TNBC.

## Modification of DNA structure by reactive nitrogen species as a result of 2-methoxyestradiol-induced neuronal nitric oxide synthase uncoupling in metastatic osteosarcoma cells.

2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) is a physiological anticancer compound, metabolite of 17β-estradiol. Previously, our group evidenced that from mechanistic point of view one of anticancer mechanisms of action of 2-ME is specific induction and nuclear hijacking of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), resulting in local generation of nitro-oxidative stress and finally, cancer cell death. The current study aims to establish the substantial mechanism of generation of reactive nitrogen species by 2-ME. We further achieved to identify the specific reactive nitrogen species involved in DNA-damaging mechanism of 2-ME. The study was performed using metastatic osteosarcoma 143B cells. We detected the release of biologically active (free) nitric oxide (•NO) with concurrent measurements of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in real time in a single cell of 143B cell line by using •NO/ONOO- sensitive microsensors after stimulation with calcium ionophore. Detection of nitrogen dioxide (•NO2) and determination of chemical rate constants were carried out by a stopped-flow technique. The affinity of reactive nitrogen species toward the guanine base of DNA was evaluated by density functional theory calculations. Expression and localization of nuclear factor NF-kB was determined using imaging cytometry, while cell viability assay was evaluated by MTT assay. Herein, we presented that 2-ME triggers pro-apoptotic signalling cascade by increasing cellular reactive nitrogen species overproduction - a result of enzymatic uncoupling of increased nNOS protein levels. In particular, we proved that ONOO- and •NO2 directly formed from peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) and/or by auto-oxidation of •NO, are inducers of DNA damage in anticancer mechanism of 2-ME. Specifically, the affinity of reactive nitrogen species toward the guanine base of DNA, evaluated by density functional theory calculations, decreased in the order: ONOOH &gt; ONOO- &gt; •NO2 &gt; •NO. Therefore, we propose to consider the specific inducers of nNOS as an effective tool in the field of chemotherapy.
