## Genetic association between gut microbiome and blood pressure and blood cell count as mediator: A two-step Mendelian randomization analysis.
 18.05.2024, _J Zhang, J He, Y Liao, X Xia, F Yang_


Previous studies have established a genetic link between gut microbiota and hypertension, but whether blood cell count plays a mediating role in this remains unknown. This study aims to explore genetic associations and causal factors involving the gut microbiome, peripheral blood cell count, and blood pressure.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy in childbearing-age females which can cause many complications, such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. The metabolic disorders in patients with PCOS were linked to gut microbial dysbiosis. However, the correlation between the gut microbial community and dyslipidemia in PCOS remains unillustrated. Our study elucidated the different gut microbiota in patients with PCOS and dyslipidemia (PCOS.D) compared to those with only PCOS and healthy women.
