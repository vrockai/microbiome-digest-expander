## A meta-analysis of mannose-binding lectin gene polymorphisms with the risk of recurrent vulvovaginal infections.
 13.04.2020, _N Kalia, J Singh, AK Rauniyar, M Kaur_


The genetic variants of Mannose-Binding Lectin, a vital component of innate immunity have been studied with acute/recurrent vaginal infections ((R)VVI) and presented inconclusive findings. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data were conducted to assess the possible role of these variations in (R)VVI. A comprehensive search was made using PubMed, Web of Science and Google scholar till June 18, 2019. A total of 12 studies met the specified criteria and were included in the analysis. Different comparisons were made on the basis of the outcome of interest that resulted in the filtering of studies for the pooled analysis to find an association using the standard genetic models. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was chosen as the effect measure for the data synthesis. The trim and fill technique was applied to adjust the publication bias. The meta-analysis revealed the significant association (p &lt; 0.05) of rs1800450 polymorphism with RVVI risk (OR ≥ 3.5) in all the genetic models. The subgroup analysis identified the same association in Caucasian and Mixed ethnicity. Quantitative synthesis based on RVVC showed&gt;3.5 fold risk of disease development accredited to rs1800450. A combined evaluation of Exon1 variants showed no association with (R)VVI. This meta-analysis suggests rs1800450 polymorphism as a genetic predisposing factor for RVVI, but to reinforce, further studies with a larger sample size are warranted.

## Gut microbial diversity across a contact zone for California voles: implications for lineage divergence of hosts and mito-nuclear mismatch in the assembly of the mammalian gut microbiome.
 13.04.2020, _D Lin, EA Lacey, BH Bach, K Bi, CJ Conroy, A Suvorov, RCK Bowie_


Gut microbial diversity is thought to reflect the co-evolution of microbes and their hosts as well as current host-specific attributes such as genetic background and environmental setting. To explore interactions among these parameters, we characterized variation in gut microbiome composition in California voles (Microtus californicus) across a contact zone between two recently diverged lineages of this species. Because this contact zone contains individuals with mismatched mitochondrial-nuclear genomes (cybrids), it provides an important opportunity to explore how different components of the genotype contribute to gut microbial diversity. Analyses of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences and joint species distribution modeling revealed that host genotypes and genetic differentiation among host populations together explained more than 50% of microbial community variation across our sampling transect. The ranked importance (most to least) of factors contributing to gut microbial diversity in our study populations were: genome-wide population differentiation, local environmental conditions, and host genotypes. However, differences in microbial communities among vole populations (β-diversity) did not follow patterns of lineage divergence (i.e. phylosymbiosis). Instead, among-population variation was best explained by the spatial distribution of hosts, as expected if the environment is a primary source of gut microbial diversity (i.e. dispersal limitation hypothesis). Across the contact zone, several bacterial taxa differed in relative abundance between the two parental lineages as well as among individuals with mismatched mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Thus, genetic divergence among host lineages and mito-nuclear genomic mismatches may also contribute to microbial diversity by altering interactions between host genomes and gut microbiota (i.e. hologenome speciation hypothesis).

## Microbiome maturation during a unique developmental window.
 12.04.2020, _E Videvall_


Shortly after birth, mammals are colonized by a multitude of microbes derived from the mother and the environment. Studies in model organisms have demonstrated that the structure and composition of the gut microbiome of offspring steadily mature with increasing diversity during nursing and weaning (Sommer &amp; Bäckhed, 2013). This period of microbiome assembly is critical for young mammals because the gut microbes they acquire will help train their immune system (Lathrop et al., 2011) with potential long-lasting effects on their health (Cox et al., 2014). In an article in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Stoffel et al. (2020) investigated the gut microbiota of northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) during a key developmental window. A month after giving birth, elephant seal mothers stop nursing their pups and return to the sea. As a consequence, their pups go from a diet of milk rich in fat to abruptly enter a post-weaning fasting period which lasts for about two months while they remain with the colony. This particular life-history trait therefore offered the authors a unique and exciting opportunity to evaluate intrinsic factors contributing to gut microbiota development in a wild marine mammal.

## Reduced microbial diversity induces larger volatile organic compound emissions from soils.
 13.04.2020, _L Abis, B Loubet, R Ciuraru, F Lafouge, S Houot, V Nowak, J Tripied, S Dequiedt, PA Maron, S Sadet-Bourgeteau_


Microorganisms in soil are known to be a source and a sink of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The role of the microbial VOCs on soil ecosystem regulation has been increasingly demonstrated in the recent years. Nevertheless, little is known about the influence of the microbial soil community structure and diversity on VOC emissions. This novel study analyzed the effect of reduced microbial diversity in soil on VOC emissions. We found that reduced levels of microbial diversity in soil increased VOC emissions from soils, while the number of different VOCs emitted decreased. Furthermore, we found that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and fungi phyla were positively correlated to VOC emissions, and other prokaryotic phyla were either negatively correlated or very slightly positively correlated to VOCs emissions. Our interpretation is that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and fungi were VOC producers while the other prokaryotic phyla were consumers. Finally, we discussed the possible role of VOCs as mediators of microbial interactions in soil.

## Increased temperatures alter viable microbial biomass, ammonia oxidizing bacteria and extracellular enzymatic activities in Antarctic soils.
 10.04.2020, _S Barnard, MW Van Goethem, SZ de Scally, DA Cowan, PJ van Rensburg, S Claassens, TP Makhalanyane_


The effects of temperature on microorganisms in high latitude regions, and their possible feedbacks in response to change, are unclear. Here, we assess microbial functionality and composition in response to a substantial temperature change. Total soil biomass, amoA gene sequencing, extracellular activity assays and soil physicochemistry were measured to assess a warming scenario. Soil warming to 15°C for 30 days triggered a significant decrease in microbial biomass compared to baseline soils (0°C; P &lt; 0.05) after incubations had induced an initial increase. These changes coincided with increases in extracellular enzymatic activity for peptide hydrolysis and phenolic oxidation at higher temperatures, but not for the degradation of carbon substrates. Shifts in ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) community composition related most significantly to changes in soil carbon content (P &lt; 0.05), which gradually increased in microcosms exposed to a persistently elevated temperature relative to baseline incubations, while temperature did not influence AOBs. The concentration of soil ammonium (NH4+) decreased significantly at higher temperatures subsequent to an initial increase, possibly due to higher conversion rates of NH4+ to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria. We show that higher soil temperatures may reduce viable microbial biomass in cold environments but stimulate their activity over a short period.

## Long-term effects of stump removal and tree species composition on the diversity and structure of soil fungal communities.
 10.04.2020, _D Modi, S Simard, J Bérubé, L Lavkulich, R Hamelin, SJ Grayston_


Stump removal is a common forest management practice used to reduce the mortality of trees affected by the fungal pathogen-mediated root disease, Armillaria root rot, but the impact of stumping on soil fungal community structure is not well understood. This study analyzed the long-term impact of stumping and tree species composition on the abundance, diversity and taxonomic composition of soil fungal communities using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) marker-based DNA metabarcoding in a 48-year-old trial at Skimikin, British Columbia. A total of 108 samples were collected from FH (fermented and humus layers), and soil mineral horizons (A and B) from stumped and unstumped plots of six tree species treatments (pure stands and admixtures of Douglas-fir, western red-cedar and paper birch). Fungal α-diversity in the A horizon significantly increased with stumping regardless of tree species composition, while β-diversity was significantly affected by stumping in all the horizons. We also observed that the relative abundance of the saprotrophic fungal community declined while that of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community increased with stumping. In conclusion, increase in ectomycorrhizal fungal associations, which are positively associated with tree productivity, suggests that stumping can be considered a good management practice for mitigating root disease and promoting tree regeneration.

## Functional roles of microbial symbionts in plant cold tolerance.
 13.04.2020, _IS Acuña-Rodríguez, KK Newsham, PE Gundel, C Torres-Díaz, MA Molina-Montenegro_


In this review, we examine the functional roles of microbial symbionts in plant tolerance to cold and freezing stresses. The impacts of symbionts on antioxidant activity, hormonal signaling and host osmotic balance are described, including the effects of the bacterial endosymbionts Burkholderia, Pseudomonas and Azospirillum on photosynthesis and the accumulation of carbohydrates such as trehalose and raffinose that improve cell osmotic regulation and plasma membrane integrity. The influence of root fungal endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on plant physiology at low temperatures, for example their effects on nutrient acquisition and the accumulation of indole-3-acetic acid and antioxidants in tissues, are also reviewed. Meta-analyses are presented showing that aspects of plant performance (shoot biomass, relative water content, sugar and proline concentrations and Fv /Fm ) are enhanced in symbiotic plants at low (-1 to 15 °C), but not at high (20-26 °C), temperatures. We discuss the implications of microbial symbionts for plant performance at low and sub-zero temperatures in the natural environment and propose future directions for research into the effects of symbionts on the cold and freezing tolerances of plants, concluding that further studies should routinely incorporate symbiotic microbes in their experimental designs.

## Diverse groups of Fungi are associated with plastics in the surface waters of the Western South Atlantic and the Antarctic Peninsula.
 09.04.2020, _ALDF Lacerda, MC Proietti, ER Secchi, JD Taylor_


Marine plastic pollution has a range of negative impacts for biota and the colonization of plastics in the marine environment by microorganisms may have significant ecological impacts. However, data on epiplastic organisms, particularly fungi, is still lacking for many ocean regions. To evaluate plastic associated fungi and their geographic distribution, we characterised plastics sampled from surface waters of the western South Atlantic (WSA) and Antarctic Peninsula (AP), using DNA metabarcoding of three molecular markers (ITS2, 18S rRNA V4 and V9 regions). Numerous taxa from 8 fungal phyla and a total of 64 orders were detected, including groups that had not yet been described associated with plastics. There was a varied phylogenetic assemblage of predominantly known saprotrophic taxa within the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. We found a range of marine cosmopolitan genera present on plastics in both locations, i.e Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Wallemia and a number of taxa unique to each region, as well as a high variation of taxa such as Chytridiomycota and Aphelidomycota between locations. Within these basal fungal groups we identified a number of phylogenetically novel taxa. This is the first description of fungi from the Plastisphere within the Southern Hemisphere, and highlights the need to further investigate the potential impacts of plastic associated fungi on other organisms and marine ecosystems.
