Studies suggest that inducing gut microbiota changes may alter both muscle physiology and cognitive behaviour. Gut microbiota may play a role in both anabolic resistance of older muscle, and cognition. In this placebo controlled double blinded randomised controlled trial of 36 twin pairs (72 individuals), aged ≥60, each twin pair are block randomised to receive either placebo or prebiotic daily for 12 weeks. Resistance exercise and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation is prescribed to all participants. Outcomes are physical function and cognition. The trial is carried out remotely using video visits, online questionnaires and cognitive testing, and posting of equipment and biological samples. The prebiotic supplement is well tolerated and results in a changed gut microbiome [e.g., increased relative Bifidobacterium abundance]. There is no significant difference between prebiotic and placebo for the primary outcome of chair rise time (β = 0.579; 95% CI -1.080-2.239 p = 0.494). The prebiotic improves cognition (factor score versus placebo (β = -0.482; 95% CI,-0.813, -0.141; p = 0.014)). Our results demonstrate that cheap and readily available gut microbiome interventions may improve cognition in our ageing population. We illustrate the feasibility of remotely delivered trials for older people, which could reduce under-representation of older people in clinical trials. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04309292.

Early-life human gut microbiome is a pivotal driver of gut homeostasis and infant health. However, the viral component (known as "virome") remains mostly unexplored. Here, we establish the Early-Life Gut Virome (ELGV), a catalog of 160,478 non-redundant DNA and RNA viral sequences from 8130 gut virus-like particles (VLPs) enriched or bulk metagenomes in the first three years of life. By clustering, 82,141 viral species are identified, 68.3% of which are absent in existing databases built mainly from adults, and 64 and 8 viral species based on VLPs-enriched and bulk metagenomes, respectively, exhibit potentials as biomarkers to distinguish infants from adults. With the largest longitudinal population of infants profiled by either VLPs-enriched or bulk metagenomic sequencing, we track the inherent instability and temporal development of the early-life human gut virome, and identify differential viruses associated with multiple clinical factors. The mother-infant shared virome and interactions between gut virome and bacteriome early in life are further expanded. Together, the ELGV catalog provides the most comprehensive and complete metagenomic blueprint of the early-life human gut virome, facilitating the discovery of pediatric disease-virome associations in future.

## Bisphenol A exposure affects specific gut taxa and drives microbiota dynamics in childhood obesity.
 01.03.2024, _A Lopez-Moreno, K Cerk, L Rodrigo, A Suarez, M Aguilera, A Ruiz-Rodriguez_


Cumulative xenobiotic exposure has an environmental and human health impact which is currently assessed under the One Health approach. Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure and its potential link with childhood obesity that has parallelly increased during the last decades deserve special attention. It stands during prenatal or early life and could trigger comorbidities and non-communicable diseases along life. Accumulation in the nature of synthetic chemicals supports the "environmental obesogen" hypothesis, such as BPA. This estrogen-mimicking xenobiotic has shown endocrine disruptive and obesogenic effects accompanied by gut microbiota misbalance that is not yet well elucidated. This study aimed to investigate specific microbiota taxa isolated and selected by direct BPA exposure and reveal its role on the overall children microbiota community and dynamics, driving toward specific obesity dysbiosis. A total of 333 BPA-resistant isolated species obtained through culturing after several exposure conditions were evaluated for their role and interplay with the global microbial community. The selected BPA-cultured taxa biomarkers showed a significant impact on alpha diversity. Specifically, Clostridium and Romboutsia were positively associated promoting the richness of microbiota communities, while Intestinibacter, Escherichia-Shigella, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus were negatively associated. Microbial community dynamics and networks analyses showed differences according to the study groups. The normal-weight children group exhibited a more enriched, structured, and connected taxa network compared to overweight and obese groups, which could represent a more resilient community to xenobiotic substances. In this sense, subnetwork analysis generated with the BPA-cultured genera showed a correlation between taxa connectivity and more diverse potential enzymatic BPA degradation capacities.IMPORTANCEOur findings indicate how gut microbiota taxa with the capacity to grow in BPA were differentially represented within differential body mass index children study groups and how these taxa affected the overall dynamics toward patterns of diversity generally recognized in dysbiosis. Community network and subnetwork analyses corroborated the better connectedness and stability profiles for normal-weight group compared to the overweight and obese groups.

The fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) is a therapeutic transplant of fecal microbiota from healthy donors to patients. This practice is aimed at restoring eubiosis and rebalancing the enteric and systemic immune responses, and then eliminating pathogenic triggers of multiple disease, including neurodegenerative diseases. Alterations of gut microbiota (GM) affect the central nervous system (CNS) health, impacting neuro-immune interactions, synaptic plasticity, myelination, and skeletal muscle function. T-regulatory lymphocytes (Treg) are among the most important players in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), altering the disease course. Along with circulating neuropeptides, other immune cells, and the gut-brain axis, the GM influences immunological tolerance and controls Treg's number and suppressive functions. A double-blind, controlled, multicenter study on FMT in ALS patients has been designed to evaluate if FMT can modulate neuroinflammation, by restoring Treg number, thus modifying disease activity and progression.

## Gut microbiota facilitate adaptation of invasive moths to new host plants.
 29.02.2024, _S Zhang, F Song, J Wang, X Li, Y Zhang, W Zhou, L Xu_


Gut microbiota are important in the adaptation of phytophagous insects to their plant hosts. However, the interaction between gut microbiomes and pioneering populations of invasive insects during their adaptation to new hosts, particularly in the initial phases of invasion, has been less studied. We studied the contribution of the gut microbiome to host adaptation in the globally recognized invasive pest, Hyphantria cunea, as it expands its range into southern China. The southern population of H. cunea shows effective adaptation to Metasequoia glyptostroboides and exhibits greater larval survival on Metasequoia than the original population. Genome resequencing revealed no significant differences in functions related to host adaptation between the two populations. The compatibility between southern H. cunea populations and M. glyptostroboides revealed a correlation between the abundance of several gut bacteria genera (Bacteroides, Blautia, and Coprococcus) and H. cunea survival. Transplanting the larval gut microbiome from southern to northern populations enhanced the adaptability of the latter to the previously unsuitable plant M. glyptostroboides. This research provides evidence that the gut microbiome of pioneering populations can enhance the compatibility of invasive pests to new hosts and enable more rapid adaptation to new habitats.

## A Synthetic Microbiome Based on Dominant Microbes in Wild Rice Rhizosphere to Promote Sulfur Utilization.
 04.03.2024, _C Wang, J Chang, L Tian, Y Sun, E Wang, Z Yao, L Ye, H Zhang, Y Pang, C Tian_


Sulfur (S) is one of the main components of important biomolecules, which has been paid more attention in the anaerobic environment of rice cultivation. In this study, 12 accessions of rice materials, belonging to two Asian rice domestication systems and one African rice domestication system, were used by shotgun metagenomics sequencing to compare the structure and function involved in S cycle of rhizosphere microbiome between wild and cultivated rice. The sulfur cycle functional genes abundances were significantly different between wild and cultivated rice rhizosphere in the processes of sulfate reduction and other sulfur compounds conversion, implicating that wild rice had a stronger mutually-beneficial relationship with rhizosphere microbiome, enhancing sulfur utilization. To assess the effects of sulfate reduction synthetic microbiomes, Comamonadaceae and Rhodospirillaceae, two families containing the genes of two key steps in the dissimilatory sulfate reduction, aprA and dsrA respectively, were isolated from wild rice rhizosphere. Compared with the control group, the dissimilatory sulfate reduction in cultivated rice rhizosphere was significantly improved in the inoculated with different proportions groups. It confirmed that the synthetic microbiome can promote the S-cycling in rice, and suggested that may be feasible to construct the synthetic microbiome step by step based on functional genes to achieve the target functional pathway. In summary, this study reveals the response of rice rhizosphere microbial community structure and function to domestication, and provides a new idea for the construction of synthetic microbiome.

## Life at the borderlands: microbiomes of interfaces critical to One Health.
 01.03.2024, _SR Law, F Mathes, AM Paten, P Alexandre, R Regmi, C Reid, A Safarchi, S Shaktivesh, Y Wang, A Wilson, SA Rice, VVSR Gupta_


Microbiomes are foundational components of the environment that provide essential services relating to food security, carbon sequestration, human health, and the overall well-being of ecosystems. Microbiota exert their effects primarily through complex interactions at interfaces with their plant, animal, and human hosts, as well as within the soil environment. This review aims to explore the ecological, evolutionary, and molecular processes governing the establishment and function of microbiome-host relationships, specifically at interfaces critical to One Health - a transdisciplinary framework that recognises that the health outcomes of people, animals, plants and the environment are tightly interconnected. Within the context of One Health, the core principles underpinning microbiome assembly will be discussed in detail, including biofilm formation, microbial recruitment strategies, mechanisms of microbial attachment, community succession and the effect these processes have on host function and health. Finally, this review will catalogue recent advances in microbiology and microbial ecology methods that can be used to profile microbial interfaces, with particular attention to multi-omic, advanced imaging, and modelling approaches. These technologies are essential for delineating the general and specific principles governing microbiome assembly and functions, mapping microbial interconnectivity across varying spatial and temporal scales, and for the establishment of predictive frameworks that will guide the development of targeted microbiome-interventions to deliver One Health outcomes.

## Neural network establishes co-occurrence links between transformation products of the contaminant and the soil microbiome.
 29.02.2024, _Y Xiang, Y Yu, J Wang, W Li, Y Rong, H Ling, Z Chen, Y Qian, X Han, J Sun, Y Yang, L Chen, C Zhao, J Li, K Chen_


It remains challenging to establish reliable links between transformation products (TPs) of contaminants and corresponding microbes. This challenge arises due to the sophisticated experimental regime required for TP discovery and the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and mass spectrometry datasets, which can potentially confound statistical inference. In this study, we present a new strategy by combining the use of 2H-labeled Stable Isotope-Assisted Metabolomics (2H-SIAM) with a neural network-based algorithm (i.e., MMvec) to explore links between TPs of pyrene and the soil microbiome. The links established by this novel strategy were further validated using different approaches. Briefly, a metagenomic study provided indirect evidence for the established links, while the identification of pyrene degraders from soils, and a DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) study offered direct evidence. The comparison among different approaches, including Pearson's and Spearman's correlations, further confirmed the superior performance of our strategy. In conclusion, we summarize the unique features of the combined use of 2H-SIAM and MMvec. This study not only addresses the challenges in linking TPs to microbes but also introduces an innovative and effective approach for such investigations. Environmental Implication: Taxonomically diverse bacteria performing successive metabolic steps of the contaminant were firstly depicted in the environmental matrix.

Big Data are increasingly used in obesity and nutrition research to gain new insights and derive personalized guidance; however, this data in raw form are often not usable. Substantial preprocessing, which requires machine learning (ML), human judgment, and specialized software, is required to transform Big Data into artificial intelligence (AI)- and ML-ready data. These preprocessing steps are the most complex part of the entire modeling pipeline. Understanding the complexity of these steps by the end user is critical for reducing misunderstanding, faulty interpretation, and erroneous downstream conclusions.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a type of tumor caused by the uncontrolled growth of cells in the mucosa lining the last part of the intestine. Emerging evidence underscores an association between CRC and gut microbiome dysbiosis. The high mortality rate of this cancer has made it necessary to develop new early diagnostic methods. Machine learning (ML) techniques can represent a solution to evaluate the interaction between intestinal microbiota and host physiology. Through explained artificial intelligence (XAI) it is possible to evaluate the individual contributions of microbial taxonomic markers for each subject. Our work also implements the Shapley Method Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm to identify for each subject which parameters are important in the context of CRC.

## A metatranscriptomics strategy for efficient characterization of the microbiome in human tissues with low microbial biomass.
 04.03.2024, _J Pereira-Marques, RM Ferreira, C Figueiredo_

The high background of host RNA poses a major challenge to metatranscriptome analysis of human samples. Hence, metatranscriptomics has been mainly applied to microbe-rich samples, while its application in human tissues with low ratio of microbial to host cells has yet to be explored. Since there is no computational workflow specifically designed for the taxonomic and functional analysis of this type of samples, we propose an effective metatranscriptomics strategy to accurately characterize the microbiome in human tissues with a low ratio of microbial to host content. We experimentally generated synthetic samples with well-characterized bacterial and host cell compositions, and mimicking human samples with high and low microbial loads. These synthetic samples were used for optimizing and establishing the workflow in a controlled setting. Our results show that the integration of the taxonomic analysis of optimized Kraken 2/Bracken with the functional analysis of HUMAnN 3 in samples with low microbial content, enables the accurate identification of a large number of microbial species with a low false-positive rate, while improving the detection of microbial functions. The effectiveness of our metatranscriptomics workflow was demonstrated in synthetic samples, simulated datasets, and most importantly, human gastric tissue specimens, thus providing a proof of concept for its applicability on mucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. The use of an accurate and reliable metatranscriptomics approach for human tissues with low microbial content will expand our understanding of the functional activity of the mucosal microbiome, uncovering critical interactions between the microbiome and the host in health and disease.

## On the limits of 16S rRNA gene-based metagenome prediction and functional profiling.
 01.03.2024, _MS Matchado, M Rühlemann, S Reitmeier, T Kacprowski, F Frost, D Haller, J Baumbach, M List_


_Humans, Metagenome, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Genes, rRNA, Microbiota, Algorithms_
Molecular profiling techniques such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics or metabolomics offer important insights into the functional diversity of the microbiome. In contrast, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a widespread and cost-effective technique to measure microbial diversity, only allows for indirect estimation of microbial function. To mitigate this, tools such as PICRUSt2, Tax4Fun2, PanFP and MetGEM infer functional profiles from 16S rRNA gene sequencing data using different algorithms. Prior studies have cast doubts on the quality of these predictions, motivating us to systematically evaluate these tools using matched 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic datasets, and simulated data. Our contribution is threefold: (i) using simulated data, we investigate if technical biases could explain the discordance between inferred and expected results; (ii) considering human cohorts for type two diabetes, colorectal cancer and obesity, we test if health-related differential abundance measures of functional categories are concordant between 16S rRNA gene-inferred and metagenome-derived profiles and; (iii) since 16S rRNA gene copy number is an important confounder in functional profiles inference, we investigate if a customised copy number normalisation with the rrnDB database could improve the results. Our results show that 16S rRNA gene-based functional inference tools generally do not have the necessary sensitivity to delineate health-related functional changes in the microbiome and should thus be used with care. Furthermore, we outline important differences in the individual tools tested and offer recommendations for tool selection.
