The aim of the present scoping review was to determine the characteristics of studies evaluating fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), as well as its effects and safety as a therapeutic intervention for people living with HIV. We conducted a scoping review following the methodology of the Joanna Briggs Institute. We searched the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Medline until September 19, 2021. Studies that used FMT in people living with HIV and explored its effects on the health of these people were included. Two randomized and two uncontrolled clinical trials with a total of 55 participants were included. Participants were well-controlled HIV infected people. Regarding microbiota changes, three studies found significant post-FMT increases in Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Î±-diversity, Chao-index, and/or Shannon-index, and/or decreases in Bacteroides. Regarding markers of intestinal damage, one study found a decrease in intestinal fatty-acid binding protein post- FMT, and another study found an increase in zonulin. Other outcomes evaluated by the studies were: markers of immune and inflammatory activation, markers of immunocompetence (CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes), and HIV viral load; however, none showed significant changes. Clinical outcomes were not evaluated by these studies. Regarding the safety of FMT, only mild adverse events were appreciated. No serious adverse events were reported. The clinical evidence for FMT in people living with HIV is sparse. FMT appears to have good tolerability and, no serious adverse events have been reported so far. Further clinical trials and evaluation of clinically important biomedical outcomes for FMT in people living with HIV are needed.

## Microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites in vascular inflammation and cardiovascular disease.
 22.04.2022, _N Paeslack, M Mimmler, S Becker, Z Gao, MP Khuu, A Mann, F Malinarich, T Regen, C Reinhardt_


The essential amino acid tryptophan (Trp) is metabolized by gut commensals, yielding in compounds that affect innate immune cell functions directly, but also acting on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), thus regulating the maintenance of group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), promoting T helper 17 (TH17) cell differentiation, and interleukin-22 production. In addition, microbiota-derived Trp metabolites have direct effects on the vascular endothelium, thus influencing the development of vascular inflammatory phenotypes. Indoxyl sulfate was demonstrated to promote vascular inflammation, whereas indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde had protective roles. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence for a contributory role of microbiota-derived indole-derivatives in blood pressure regulation and hypertension. Interestingly, there are indications for a role of the kynurenine pathway in atherosclerotic lesion development. Here, we provide an overview on the emerging role of gut commensals in the modulation of Trp metabolism and its influence in cardiovascular disease development.

There is emerging evidence that diet has a major modulatory influence on brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) interactions with important implications for brain health, and for several brain disorders. The BGM system is made up of neuroendocrine, neural, and immune communication channels which establish a network of bidirectional interactions between the brain, the gut and its microbiome. Diet not only plays a crucial role in shaping the gut microbiome, but it can modulate structure and function of the brain through these communication channels. In this review, we summarize the evidence available from preclinical and clinical studies on the influence of dietary habits and interventions on a selected group of psychiatric and neurologic disorders including depression, cognitive decline, Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. We will particularly address the role of diet-induced microbiome changes which have been implicated in these effects, and some of which are shared between different brain disorders. While the majority of these findings have been demonstrated in preclinical and in cross-sectional, epidemiological studies, to date there is insufficient evidence from mechanistic human studies to make conclusions about causality between a specific diet and microbially mediated brain function. Many of the dietary benefits on microbiome and brain health have been attributed to anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the microbial metabolites of dietary fiber and polyphenols. The new attention given to dietary factors in brain disorders has the potential to improve treatment outcomes with currently available pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies.

Introduction. Evidence has linked exogenous and endogenous sex hormones with the human microbiome.Hypothesis/Gap statement. The longitudinal effects of oral contraceptives (OC) on the human gut microbiome have not previously been studied.Aim. We sought to examine the longitudinal impact of OC use on the taxonomic composition and metabolic functions of the gut microbiota and endogenous sex steroid hormones after initiation of OC use.Methodology. We recruited ten healthy women who provided blood and stool samples prior to OC use, 1 month and 6 months after starting OC. We measured serum levels of sex hormones, including estradiol, progesterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and total testosterone. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from faecal samples. Species and metabolic pathway abundances were determined using MetaPhlAn2 and HUMAnN2. Multivariate association with linear models was used to identify microbial species and metabolic pathways associated with OC use and endogenous levels of sex hormones.Results. The percentage variance of the microbial community explained by individual factors ranged from 9.9 % for age to 2.7 % for time since initiation of OC use. We observed no changes in the diversity or composition of the gut microbiome following OC initiation. However, the relative abundance of the biosynthesis pathways of peptidoglycan, amino acids (lysine, threonine, methionine, and tryptophan), and the NAD salvage pathway increased after OC initiation. In addition, serum levels of estradiol and SHBG were positively associated with Eubacterium ramulus, a flavonoid-degrading bacterium. Similarly, microbes involving biosynthesis of l-lysine, l-threonine, and l-methionine were significantly associated with lower estradiol, SHBG, and higher levels of total testosterone.Conclusion. Our study provides the first piece of evidence supporting the association between exogenous and endogenous sex hormones and gut microbiome composition and function.

## Longitudinal gut virome analysis identifies specific viral signatures that precede necrotizing enterocolitis onset in preterm infants.
 22.04.2022, _EA Kaelin, C Rodriguez, C Hall-Moore, JA Hoffmann, LA Linneman, IM Ndao, BB Warner, PI Tarr, LR Holtz, ES Lim_


Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious consequence of preterm birth and is often associated with gut bacterial microbiome alterations. However, little is known about the development of the gut virome in preterm infants, or its role in NEC. Here, using metagenomic sequencing, we characterized the DNA gut virome of 9 preterm infants who developed NEC and 14 gestational age-matched preterm infants who did not. Infants were sampled longitudinally before NEC onset over the first 11 weeks of life. We observed substantial interindividual variation in the gut virome between unrelated preterm infants, while intraindividual variation over time was significantly less. We identified viral and bacterial signatures in the gut that preceded NEC onset. Specifically, we observed a convergence towards reduced viral beta diversity over the 10 d before NEC onset, which was driven by specific viral signatures and accompanied by specific viral-bacterial interactions. Our results indicate that bacterial and viral perturbations precede the sudden onset of NEC. These findings suggest that early life virome signatures in preterm infants may be implicated in NEC.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Defective CFTR leads to accumulation of dehydrated viscous mucus within the small intestine, luminal acidification and altered intestinal motility, resulting in blockage. These changes promote gut microbial dysbiosis, adversely influencing the normal proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. Using Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing and immunohistochemistry, we assessed changes in mucosa-attached microbiome and epithelial cell profile in the small intestine of CF mice and a CF patient compared to wild-type mice and non-CF humans. We found increased abundance of pro-inflammatory Escherichia and depletion of beneficial secondary bile-acid producing bacteria in the ileal mucosa-attached microbiome of CFTR-null mice. The ileal mucosa in a CF patient was dominated by a non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas species and lacked numerous beneficial anti-inflammatory and short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. In the ileum of both CF mice and a CF patient, the number of absorptive enterocytes, Paneth and glucagon-like peptide 1 and 2 secreting L-type enteroendocrine cells were decreased, whereas stem and goblet cell numbers were increased. These changes in mucosa-attached microbiome and epithelial cell profile suggest that microbiota-host interactions may contribute to intestinal CF disease development with implications for therapy.

## Plasma branched-chain and aromatic amino acids correlate with the gut microbiota and severity of Parkinson's disease.
 22.04.2022, _Y Zhang, X He, Y Qian, S Xu, C Mo, Z Yan, X Yang, Q Xiao_


Disturbances of circulating amino acids have been demonstrated in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there have been no consistent results for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs), and related factors have not been explored. We aimed to explore plasma BCAA and AAA profiles in PD patients, and identify their correlations with clinical characteristics and the gut microbiota. Plasma BCAA (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and AAA (tyrosine and phenylalanine) levels were measured in 106 PD patients and 114 controls. Fecal samples were collected from PD patients for microbiota sequencing and functional analysis. We found that plasma BCAAs and tyrosine were decreased in PD patients. BCAAs and AAAs were correlated with clinical characteristics and microbial taxa, and, in particular, they were negatively correlated with the Hoehn and Yahr stage. Compared with early PD patients, BCAA and AAA levels were even lower, and microbial composition was altered in advanced PD patients. Predictive functional analysis indicated that predicted genes numbers involved in BCAA biosynthesis were lower in advanced PD patients. What's more, the fecal abundances of critical genes (ilvB, ilvC, ilvD, and ilvN) involved in BCAA biosynthesis were reduced and fecal BCAA concentrations were lower in advanced PD patients. In conclusion, the disturbances of plasma BCAAs and AAAs in PD patients may be related to the gut microbiota and exacerbated with PD severity. The microbial amino acid metabolism may serve as a potential mechanistic link.

Interactions between pathogens, host microbiota and the immune system influence many physiological and pathological processes. In the 20th century, widespread dermal vaccination with vaccinia virus (VACV) led to the eradication of smallpox but how VACV interacts with the microbiota and whether this influences the efficacy of vaccination are largely unknown. Here we report that intradermal vaccination with VACV induces a large increase in the number of commensal bacteria in infected tissue, which enhance recruitment of inflammatory cells, promote tissue damage and influence the host response. Treatment of vaccinated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice with antibiotic, or infection of genetically-matched germ-free (GF) animals caused smaller lesions without alteration in virus titre. Tissue damage correlated with enhanced neutrophil and T cell infiltration and levels of pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines and chemokines. One month after vaccination, GF and both groups of SPF mice had equal numbers of VACV-specific CD8+ T cells and were protected from disease induced by VACV challenge, despite lower levels of VACV-neutralising antibodies observed in GF animals. Thus, skin microbiota may provide an adjuvant-like stimulus during vaccination with VACV and influence the host response to vaccination.

_Feces, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Metabolome, Microbiota, Serotonin_
To gain insight into the complex microbiome-gut-brain axis in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), several modalities of biological and clinical data must be combined. We aimed to identify profiles of fecal microbiota and metabolites associated with IBS and to delineate specific phenotypes of IBS that represent potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Fecal metabolites were measured using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy and gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing (MGS) in a combined dataset of 142 IBS patients and 120 healthy controls (HCs) with extensive clinical, biological and phenotype information. Data were analyzed using support vector classification and regression and kernel t-SNE. Microbiome and metabolome profiles could distinguish IBS and HC with an area-under-the-receiver-operator-curve of 77.3% and 79.5%, respectively, but this could be improved by combining microbiota and metabolites to 83.6%. No significant differences in predictive ability of the microbiome-metabolome data were observed between the three classical, stool pattern-based, IBS subtypes. However, unsupervised clustering showed distinct subsets of IBS patients based on fecal microbiome-metabolome data. These clusters could be related plasma levels of serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetate, effects of psychological stress on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, onset of IBS after stressful events, medical history of previous abdominal surgery, dietary caloric intake and IBS symptom duration. Furthermore, pathways in metabolic reaction networks were integrated with microbiota data, that reflect the host-microbiome interactions in IBS. The identified microbiome-metabolome signatures for IBS, associated with altered serotonin metabolism and unfavorable stress response related to GI symptoms, support the microbiota-gut-brain link in the pathogenesis of IBS.

## Multi-omics analyses of serum metabolome, gut microbiome and brain function reveal dysregulated microbiota-gut-brain axis in bipolar depression.

The intricate processes of microbiota-gut-brain communication in modulating human cognition and emotion, especially in the context of mood disorders, have remained elusive. Here we performed faecal metagenomic, serum metabolomics and neuroimaging studies on a cohort of 109 unmedicated patients with depressed bipolar disorder (BD) patients and 40 healthy controls (HCs) to characterise the microbial-gut-brain axis in BD. Across over 12,000 measured metabolic features, we observed a large discrepancy (73.54%) in the serum metabolome between BD patients and HCs, spotting differentially abundant microbial-derived neuroactive metabolites including multiple B-vitamins, kynurenic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and short-chain fatty acids. These metabolites could be linked to the abundance of gut microbiota presented with corresponding biosynthetic potentials, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Citrobacter spp. (Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter werkmanii), Phascolarctobacterium spp., Yersinia spp. (Yersinia frederiksenii and Yersinia aleksiciae), Enterobacter spp. (Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter kobei) and Flavobacterium spp. Based on functional neuroimaging, BD-related neuroactive microbes and metabolites were discovered as potential markers associated with BD-typical features of functional connectivity of brain networks, hinting at aberrant cognitive function, emotion regulation, and interoception. Our study combines gut microbiota and neuroactive metabolites with brain functional connectivity, thereby revealing potential signalling pathways from the microbiota to the gut and the brain, which may have a role in the pathophysiology of BD.

## Analysis of the Vulvar Skin Microbiota in Asymptomatic Women and Patients With Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus Based on 16S rRNA Sequencing.
 23.04.2022, _X Liu, Y Zhuo, Y Zhou, J Hu, H Wen, C Xiao_


Vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that brings life-long and psychological distress to patients. It remains unclear whether this condition is related to changes in the skin microbial community. The aim of this study was to evaluate the compositional characteristics of the vulvar skin microbiota between VLS patients and asymptomatic postmenopausal women. We included 60 cases of postmenopausal patients in the outpatient vulvar clinic of Peking University First Hospital from August 2020 to October 2020. Thirty-one patients were diagnosed with VLS by vulvar skin biopsy (VLS group), while 29 women were asymptomatic volunteers (control group). DNA was extracted from vulvar skin swabs of the VLS and control groups. The V3-V4 fragments of 16S rRNA were targeted for high-throughput sequencing and gene sequence analysis. The sequencing results were analysed by Î± diversity, Î² diversity, species composition, LEfSe analysis to compare the compositional differences of the vulvar skin microbiota between the two groups. Our study revealed that at the phylum level, patients with VLS had a lower relative abundance of Firmicutes (p &lt; 0.0001) and a higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria than the control group (p &lt; 0.0001). At the genus level, Lactobacillus spp. accounted for the largest proportion of the microflora in the asymptomatic controls, while the proportion of Prevotella spp. in the VLS group was the highest. In the VLS group, the relative abundance of Finegoldia spp., Ralstonia spp., Peptoniphilus spp., Anaerococcus spp., Campylobacter spp., Providencia spp. Kelbsiella spp., Ezakiella spp., and Escherichia-Shigella spp. was significantly increased compared with the control group. Although there was no significant difference in the Î± diversity of the vulvar skin microbiota, the Î² diversity differed significantly between the two groups.

Older individuals are at increased risk of developing severe respiratory infections. However, our understanding of the impact of aging on the respiratory tract remains limited as samples from healthy humans are challenging to obtain and results can be confounded by variables such as smoking and diet. Here, we carry out a comprehensive cross-sectional study (n = 34 adult, n = 49 aged) to define the consequences of aging on the lung using the rhesus macaque model. Pulmonary function testing establishes similar age and sex differences as humans. Additionally, we report increased abundance of alveolar and infiltrating macrophages and a concomitant decrease in T cells were in aged animals. scRNAseq reveals shifts from GRZMB to IFN expressing CD8+ T cells in the lungs. These data provide insight into age-related changes in the lungs' functional, microbial, and immunological landscape that explain increased prevalence and severity of respiratory diseases in the elderly.

Symbioses between bacteria and their insect hosts can range from loose associations through to obligate interdependence. While fundamental evolutionary insights have been gained from the in-depth study of obligate mutualisms, there is increasing interest in the evolutionary potential of flexible symbiotic associations between hosts and their gut microbiomes. Understanding relationships between microbes and hosts also offers the potential for exploitation for insect control. Here, we investigate the gut microbiome of a global agricultural pest, the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata). We used 16S rRNA profiling to compare the gut microbiomes of laboratory and wild strains raised on different diets and from flies collected from various natural plant hosts. The results showed that medfly guts harbour a simple microbiome that is primarily determined by the larval diet. However, regardless of the laboratory diet or natural plant host on which flies were raised, Klebsiella spp. dominated medfly microbiomes and were resistant to removal by antibiotic treatment. We sequenced the genome of the dominant putative Klebsiella spp. ('Medkleb') isolated from the gut of the Toliman wild-type strain. Genome-wide ANI analysis placed Medkleb within the K. oxytoca / michiganensis group. Species level taxonomy for Medkleb was resolved using a mutli-locus phylogenetic approach - and molecular, sequence and phenotypic analyses all supported its identity as K. michiganensis. Medkleb has a genome size (5825435 bp) which is 1.6 standard deviations smaller than the mean genome size of free-living Klebsiella spp. Medkleb also lacks some genes involved in environmental sensing. Moreover, the Medkleb genome contains at least two recently acquired unique genomic islands as well as genes that encode pectinolytic enzymes capable of degrading plant cell walls. This may be advantageous given that the medfly diet includes unripe fruits containing high proportions of pectin. The results suggest that the medfly harbours a commensal gut bacterium that may have developed a mutualistic association with its host and provide nutritional benefits.

## Stability of the Microbiome of the Sponge Mycale (Oxymycale) acerata in the Western Antarctic Peninsula.
 23.04.2022, _L Happel, R Rondon, A Font, M GonzÃ¡lez-Aravena, CA CÃ¡rdenas_


The sponge microbiome, especially in Low Microbial Abundance (LMA) species, is expected to be influenced by the local environment; however, contrasting results exist with evidence showing that host specificity is also important, hence suggesting that the microbiome is influenced by host-specific and environmental factors. Despite sponges being important members of Southern Ocean benthic communities, their relationships with the microbial communities they host remain poorly studied. Here, we studied the spatial and temporal patterns of the microbiota associated with the ecologically important LMA sponge M. acerata at sites along â¼400 km of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) to assess patterns in the core and variable microbial components of the symbiont communities of this sponge species. The analyses of 31 samples revealed that the microbiome of M. acerata is composed of 35 prokaryotic phyla (3 Archaea, 31 Bacteria, and one unaffiliated), being mainly dominated by Proteobacteria with Gammaproteobacteria as the most dominant class. The core community was composed of six prokaryotic OTUs, with gammaproteobacterial OTU (EC94 Family), showing a mean abundance over 65% of the total abundance. Despite some differences in rare OTUs, the core community did not show clear patterns in diversity and abundance associated with specific sites/environmental conditions, confirming a low variability in community structure of this species along the WAP. The analysis at small scale (Doumer Island, Palmer Archipelago) showed no differences in space and time in the microbiome M. acerata collected at sites around the island, sampled in three consecutive years (2016-2018). Our results highlight the existence of a low spatial and temporal variability in the microbiome of M. acerata, supporting previous suggestions based on limited studies on this and other Antarctic sponges.

## Gut Microbiota-Testis Axis: FMT Mitigates High-Fat Diet-Diminished Male Fertility via Improving Systemic and Testicular Metabolome.
 21.04.2022, _Y Hao, Y Feng, X Yan, L Chen, X Ma, X Tang, R Zhong, Z Sun, M Agarwal, H Zhang, Y Zhao_


High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity is known to be associated with reduced male fertility and decreased semen quality in humans. HFD-related male infertility is a growing issue worldwide, and it is crucial to overcome this problem to ameliorate the distress of infertile couples. For the first time, we discovered that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of alginate oligosaccharide (AOS)-improved gut microbiota (A10-FMT) ameliorated HFD-decreased semen quality (sperm concentration: 286.1 Â± 14.1 versus 217.9 Â± 17.4 million/mL; sperm motility: 40.1 Â± 0.7% versus 29.0 Â± 0.9%), and male fertility (pregnancy rate: 87.4 Â± 1.1% versus 70.2 Â± 6.1%) by benefiting blood and testicular metabolome. A10-FMT improved HFD-disturbed gut microbiota by increasing gut Bacteroides (colon: 24.9 Â± 1.1% versus 8.3 Â± 0.6%; cecum: 10.2 Â± 0.7% versus 3.6 Â± 0.7%) and decreasing Mucispirillum (colon: 0.3 Â± 0.1% versus 2.8 Â± 0.4%; cecum: 2.3 Â± 0.5% versus 6.6 Â± 0.7%). A10-FMT benefited gut microbiota to improve liver function by adjusting lipid metabolism to produce n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (blood: 55.5 Â± 18.7 versus 20.3 Â± 2.4) and docosahexaenoic acid (testis: 121.2 Â± 6.2 versus 89.4 Â± 6.7), thus ameliorating HFD-impaired testicular microenvironment to rescue spermatogenesis and increase semen quality and fertility. The findings indicated that AOS-improved gut microbiota may be a promising strategy to treat obesity or metabolic issues-related male infertility in the future. IMPORTANCE HFD decreases male fertility via upsetting gut microbiota and transplantation of AOS-benefited gut microbiota (A10-FMT) improves gut microbiota to ameliorate HFD-reduced male fertility. Moreover, A10-FMT improved liver function to benefit the blood metabolome and simultaneously ameliorated the testicular microenvironment to turn the spermatogenesis process on. We demonstrated that AOS-benefited gut microbiota could be applied to treat infertile males with obesity and metabolic issues induced by HFD.

## Gut Microbiota of Wild Fish as Reporters of Compromised Aquatic Environments Sleuthed through Machine Learning.
 20.04.2022, _J Turner, X Cheng, N Saferin, JY Yeo, T Yang, B Joe_


Human-generated negative impacts on aquatic environments are rising. Despite wild fish playing a key role in aquatic ecologies and comprising a major global food source, physiological consequences of these impacts to them are poorly understood. Here we address the issue through the lens of interrelationship between wild fish and their gut microbiota, hypothesizing that fish microbiota are reporters of the aquatic environs. Two geographically separate teleost wild-fish species were studied (Lake Erie, Ohio and Caribbean Sea, US Virgin Islands). At each geo-location, fresh fecal samples were collected from fish in areas of presence or absence of known aquatic compromise. Gut microbiota was assessed via microbial 16S-rRNA gene sequencing and represents the first complete report for both fish species. Despite marked differences in geography, climate, water type, fish species, habitat, diet and gut microbial compositions, the pattern of shifts in microbiota shared by both fish species was nearly identical due to aquatic compromise. Next, these data were subjected to Machine Learning (ML) to examine reliability for using the fish-gut microbiota as an eco-marker for anthropogenic aquatic impacts. Independent of geo-location, ML predicted aquatic compromise with remarkable accuracy (&gt;90%). Overall, this study represents the first multi-species stress-related comparison of its kind and demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence via ML as a tool for bio-monitoring and detecting compromised aquatic conditions.

Origin of earliest land plants from ancestral algae dramatically accelerated the evolution of Earth's terrestrial ecosystems, in which microbial symbioses have played key roles. Recent molecular diversification analyses identify the rare, geographically-limited moss Takakia as Earth's most archaic modern land plant. Despite occupying a phylogenetic position pivotal for understanding earliest plants, Takakia microbial associations are poorly known. Here, we describe symbiosis-related structural features and contig-based metagenomic data that illuminate the evolutionary transition from streptophyte algae to early embryophytes. We observed that T. lepidozioides shares with streptophyte algae secretion of microbe-harboring mucilage and bacterial taxa such as Rhizobium and genes indicating nitrogen fixation. We find that Takakia root-analogs produce lateral mucilage organs that are more complex than generally understood, having structural analogies to angiosperm lateral roots adapted for N-fixation symbioses, including presence of intracellular microbes. We also find structural and metagenomic evidence for mycorrhiza-like species of glomalean fungi (including Rhizophagus irregularis) not previously known for mosses, as well as ascomycete fungi (e.g. Rhizoscyphus ericae) that associate with other early-diverging plants. Because Takakia is the oldest known modern plant genus, this study of plants of a remote locale not strongly influenced by human activities may indicate microbiome features of early land plants.

## Synthetic bacterial community derived from a desert rhizosphere confers salt stress resilience to tomato in the presence of a soil microbiome.

The root bacterial microbiome is important for the general health of the plant. Additionally, it can enhance tolerance to abiotic stresses, exemplified by plant species found in extreme ecological niches like deserts. These complex microbe-plant interactions can be simplified by constructing synthetic bacterial communities or SynComs from the root microbiome. Furthermore, SynComs can be applied as biocontrol agents to protect crops against abiotic stresses such as high salinity. However, there is little knowledge on the design of a SynCom that offers a consistent protection against salt stress for plants growing in a natural and, therefore, non-sterile soil which is more realistic to an agricultural setting. Here we show that a SynCom of five bacterial strains, originating from the root of the desert plant Indigofera argentea, protected tomato plants growing in a non-sterile substrate against a high salt stress. This phenotype correlated with the differential expression of salt stress related genes and ion accumulation in tomato. Quantification of the SynCom strains indicated a low penetrance into the natural soil used as the non-sterile substrate. Our results demonstrate how a desert microbiome could be engineered into a simplified SynCom that protected tomato plants growing in a natural soil against an abiotic stress.

The capacity of planktonic marine microorganisms to actively seek out and exploit microscale chemical hotspots has been widely theorized to affect ocean-basin scale biogeochemistry1-3, but has never been examined comprehensively in situ among natural microbial communities. Here, using a field-based microfluidic platform to quantify the behavioural responses of marine bacteria and archaea, we observed significant levels of chemotaxis towards microscale hotspots of phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) at a coastal field site across multiple deployments, spanning several months. Microscale metagenomics revealed that a wide diversity of marine prokaryotes, spanning 27 bacterial and 2 archaeal phyla, displayed chemotaxis towards microscale patches of DOM derived from ten globally distributed phytoplankton species. The distinct DOM composition of each phytoplankton species attracted phylogenetically and functionally discrete populations of bacteria and archaea, with 54% of chemotactic prokaryotes displaying highly specific responses to the DOM derived from only one or two phytoplankton species. Prokaryotes exhibiting chemotaxis towards phytoplankton-derived compounds were significantly enriched in the capacity to transport and metabolize specific phytoplankton-derived chemicals, and displayed enrichment in functions conducive to symbiotic relationships, including genes involved in the production of siderophores, B vitamins and growth-promoting hormones. Our findings demonstrate that the swimming behaviour of natural prokaryotic assemblages is governed by specific chemical cues, which dictate important biogeochemical transformation processes and the establishment of ecological interactions that structure the base of the marine food web.

## Genomic and metabolic adaptations of biofilms to ecological windows of opportunity in glacier-fed streams.

_Biodiversity, Biofilms, Ecosystem, Ice Cover, Microbiota, Rivers_
In glacier-fed streams, ecological windows of opportunity allow complex microbial biofilms to develop and transiently form the basis of the food web, thereby controlling key ecosystem processes. Using metagenome-assembled genomes, we unravel strategies that allow biofilms to seize this opportunity in an ecosystem otherwise characterized by harsh environmental conditions. We observe a diverse microbiome spanning the entire tree of life including a rich virome. Various co-existing energy acquisition pathways point to diverse niches and the exploitation of available resources, likely fostering the establishment of complex biofilms during windows of opportunity. The wide occurrence of rhodopsins, besides chlorophyll, highlights the role of solar energy capture in these biofilms while internal carbon and nutrient cycling between photoautotrophs and heterotrophs may help overcome constraints imposed by oligotrophy in these habitats. Mechanisms potentially protecting bacteria against low temperatures and high UV-radiation are also revealed and the selective pressure of this environment is further highlighted by a phylogenomic analysis differentiating important components of the glacier-fed stream microbiome from other ecosystems. Our findings reveal key genomic underpinnings of adaptive traits contributing to the success of complex biofilms to exploit environmental opportunities in glacier-fed streams, which are now rapidly changing owing to global warming.

## Host phenotype classification from human microbiome data is mainly driven by the presence of microbial taxa.
 21.04.2022, _R Giliberti, S Cavaliere, IE Mauriello, D Ercolini, E Pasolli_


Machine learning-based classification approaches are widely used to predict host phenotypes from microbiome data. Classifiers are typically employed by considering operational taxonomic units or relative abundance profiles as input features. Such types of data are intrinsically sparse, which opens the opportunity to make predictions from the presence/absence rather than the relative abundance of microbial taxa. This also poses the question whether it is the presence rather than the abundance of particular taxa to be relevant for discrimination purposes, an aspect that has been so far overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by performing a meta-analysis on 4,128 publicly available metagenomes associated with multiple case-control studies. At species-level taxonomic resolution, we show that it is the presence rather than the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa to be important when building classification models. Such findings are robust to the choice of the classifier and confirmed by statistical tests applied to identifying differentially abundant/present taxa. Results are further confirmed at coarser taxonomic resolutions and validated on 4,026 additional 16S rRNA samples coming from 30 public case-control studies.

## Metagenomic signatures of balancing selection in the human gut.
 21.04.2022, _AH Moeller_


Bacterial lineages that populate the human gut microbiota contend with spatial and temporal fluctuations in numerous environmental variables, including bouts of extreme selective agents like antibiotics. Oscillations in the adaptive landscape can impose balancing selection on populations, leaving characteristic signatures in the sequence variation of functionally significant genomic loci. Despite their potential importance for gut bacterial adaptation, the metagenomic targets of balancing selection have not been identified. Here, I present population genetic evidence that balancing selection maintains allelic diversity in multidrug efflux pumps of multiple predominant gut bacterial species. Metagenome-wide scans of 566,958 genes from 287 bacterial species represented by 118,617 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) indicated that most genes have been conserved by purifying selection. However, dozens of core open reading frames (CORFs) displayed positive Tajima's D values that deviated significantly from their species' genomic backgrounds, indicating the action of balancing selection. Multidrug efflux pumps (MEPs) from a diversity of bacterial species were significantly enriched among the CORFs with Tajima's D values &gt;3 in industrialized, but not non-industrialized, human populations. The AcrB subunit of a MEP from Bacteroides dorei displayed the highest Tajima's D of any CORF. Divergent haplotypes of this CORF displayed evidence of positive selection (dN&gt;dS) and homology to an E. coli AcrB subunit that binds tetracycline and macrolide antibiotics, suggesting functional significance and implicating medical antibiotics as an agent of selection acting on this locus. Other proteins identified as targets of balancing selection included peptidoglycan/LPS O-acetylases and ion transporters. Intriguingly, the degree of balancing selection acting on gut bacterial species was associated with species abundance in the gut based on metagenomic data, further suggesting fitness benefits of the allelic variation identified.

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs; including acetate, propionate, and butyrate) are an important class of biological molecules that play a major role in modulating host-microbiome interactions. Despite significant research into SCFA-mediated biological mechanisms, absolute quantification of these molecules in their native form by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry is challenging due to their relatively poor chromatographic properties. Herein, we introduce SQUAD, an isotope-based strategy for absolute quantification of SCFAs in complex biological samples. SQUAD uses aniline derivatization in conjunction with isotope dilution and analysis by reverse-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. We show that SQUAD enables absolute quantification of biologically relevant SCFAs in complex biological samples with a lower limit of detection of 40 nM and a lower limit of quantification ranging from 160 nM to 310 nM. We observed an intra- and inter-day precision under 3% (relative standard deviation) and errors in intra- and inter-day accuracy under 10%. To demonstrate this quantification strategy, we analyzed SCFAs in the caecal contents of germ free versus conventionally raised specific pathogen free (SPF) mice. We showed that acetate was the most abundant SCFA in both types of mice and was present at 200-fold higher concentration in the SPF mice. We also illustrated the use of our quantification strategy in in vitro microbial cultures from five different species of bacteria grown in Mueller Hinton media. This study illustrates the diverse SCFA production rates across microbial taxa with acetate production serving as one of the key differentiating factors across the species. In summary, we introduce an isotope dilution strategy for absolute quantification of aniline-dativized SCFAs and illustrate the utility of this approach for microbiome research.
