## Using data science for medical decision making case: role of gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis.
 16.10.2020, _J Hasic Telalovic, A Music_


A decade ago, the advancements in the microbiome data sequencing techniques initiated the development of research of the microbiome and its relationship with the host organism. The development of sophisticated bioinformatics and data science tools for the analysis of large amounts of data followed. Since then, the analyzed gut microbiome data, where microbiome is defined as a network of microorganisms inhabiting the human intestinal system, has been associated with several conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome - IBS, colorectal cancer, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, and lately in the study of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases as well. This paper aims to provide an understanding of differences between microbial data of individuals who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and those who were not by exploiting data science techniques on publicly available data.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. To define the HPV-associated microbial community among a high vaccination coverage population, we carried out a cross-sectional study with 345 young Swedish women. The microbial composition and its association with HPV infection, including 27 HPV types, were analyzed. Microbial alpha-diversity was found significantly higher in the HPV-infected group (especially with oncogenic HPV types and multiple HPV types), compared with the HPV negative group. The vaginal microbiota among HPV-infected women was characterized by a larger number of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB), Sneathia, Prevotella, and Megasphaera. In addition, the correlation analysis demonstrated that twice as many women with non-Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiota were infected with oncogenic HPV types, compared with L. crispatus-dominated vaginal microbiota. The data suggest that HPV infection, especially oncogenic HPV types, is strongly associated with a non-Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiota, regardless of age and vaccination status.

## Engineering the Microbiome to Prevent Adverse Events: Challenges and Opportunities.
 13.10.2020, _S Khan, R Hauptman, L Kelly_


In the past decade of microbiome research, we have learned about numerous adverse interactions between the microbiome and medical interventions such as drugs, radiation, and surgery. What if we could alter our microbiomes to prevent these events? In this review, we discuss potential routes to mitigate microbiome adverse events, including applications from the emerging field of microbiome engineering. We highlight cases where the microbiome acts directly on a treatment, such as via differential drug metabolism, and cases where a treatment directly harms the microbiome, such as in radiation therapy. Understanding and preventing microbiome adverse events are a difficult challenge that will require a data-driven approach involving causal statistics, multiomics techniques, and a personalized means of mitigating adverse events. We propose research considerations to encourage productive work in preventing microbiome adverse events, and we highlight the many challenges and opportunities that await. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Volume 61 is January 7, 2021.

The fecal microbiota, fecal bile acid concentrations, and abundance of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile are altered in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease in adult dogs. However, less is known in young puppies.

## Prophylactic effects of oral administration of Lactobacillus casei on house dust mite-induced asthma in mice.
 13.10.2020, _L Li, Z Fang, YK Lee, J Zhao, H Zhang, W Lu, W Chen_


This study investigated the prophylactic effects of five Lactobacillus casei strains on house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma in mice. BALB/c mice were orally administered with L. casei strains for one week before HDM treatment. Ketotifen and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG were used as positive controls. All L. casei strains decreased the number of granulocytes and the levels of Th2 and Th17 inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, L. casei3 significantly decreased the airway inflammation score. Further studies showed that L. casei3, L. casei4, and L. casei5 decreased the chemokine levels, L. casei2, L. casei4, and L. casei5 promoted the secretion of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), L. casei2 upregulated the interleukin (IL)-10 levels, and L. casei1 had no effect on these immune indices. L. casei1 and L. casei4 decreased the serum levels of total IgE and HDM-specific IgG1, respectively. L. casei3 and L. casei5 decreased both HDM-specific IgG1 and total IgE levels. L. casei2 did not affect the levels of these immunoglobulins. The gut microbiota analysis revealed that all five L. casei strains enhanced the richness of the gut microbiota mainly by increasing the abundance of Firmicutes, while there were differences at the genus level.Thus, the prophylactic effects of L. casei on HDM-induced mixed chronic airway inflammatory asthma exerted as they differentially affected the immune responses and gut microbiota composition. L. casei3, which exhibited the highest prophylactic effect, increased the acetate and propionate contents in a strain-dependent manner.

## Lactobacillus plantarum Shinshu N-07 isolated from fermented Brassica rapa L. attenuates visceral fat accumulation induced by high-fat diet in mice.

Lactobacillus plantarum Shinshu N-07 (N07) and Lactobacillus curvatus #4G2 (#4G2) were isolated from fermented Brassica rapa L. and selected as promising probiotics with anti-adiposity activities based on in vitro assays. The anti-adiposity effects of these two strains were investigated using a diet-induced obesity animal model. Epididymal adipose tissue weight and adipocyte area were significantly lower and serum triglycerides and glucose tended to be lower in mice fed the high-fat diet supplemented with N07 compared with those fed the unsupplemented high-fat diet. Strain N07 suppressed hepatic steatosis, with accompanying downregulation of lipogenic genes in the liver. Expression of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage infiltration markers tended to be suppressed by N07 supplementation. Upregulation of uncoupling protein-1 in epididymal adipose tissue by N07 suggested that the transformation of white adipose tissue to brown might have been induced. Intestinal microbiota analysis revealed that a decrease in abundance of family S24-7 (phylum Bacteroidetes) following ingestion of the high-fat diet was partly recovered by supplementation with N07. Changes in those parameters were not observed in mice fed the high-fat diet supplemented with strain #4G2, suggesting strain specificities. Thus, N07 is a potential probiotic strain that could be used to develop functional foods that attenuate visceral fat accumulation after an appropriate human intervention trial.
