## Predictive biology: modelling, understanding and harnessing microbial complexity.
 30.05.2020, _AJ Lopatkin, JJ Collins_


Predictive biology is the next great chapter in synthetic and systems biology, particularly for microorganisms. Tasks that once seemed infeasible are increasingly being realized such as designing and implementing intricate synthetic gene circuits that perform complex sensing and actuation functions, and assembling multi-species bacterial communities with specific, predefined compositions. These achievements have been made possible by the integration of diverse expertise across biology, physics and engineering, resulting in an emerging, quantitative understanding of biological design. As ever-expanding multi-omic data sets become available, their potential utility in transforming theory into practice remains firmly rooted in the underlying quantitative principles that govern biological systems. In this Review, we discuss key areas of predictive biology that are of growing interest to microbiology, the challenges associated with the innate complexity of microorganisms and the value of quantitative methods in making microbiology more predictable.

## The gut microbiome's role in the development, maintenance, and outcomes of sepsis.
 03.06.2020, _MW Adelman, MH Woodworth, C Langelier, LM Busch, JA Kempker, CS Kraft, GS Martin_


The gut microbiome regulates a number of homeostatic mechanisms in the healthy host including immune function and gut barrier protection. Loss of normal gut microbial structure and function has been associated with diseases as diverse as Clostridioides difficile infection, asthma, and epilepsy. Recent evidence has also demonstrated a link between the gut microbiome and sepsis. In this review, we focus on three key areas of the interaction between the gut microbiome and sepsis. First, prior to sepsis onset, gut microbiome alteration increases sepsis susceptibility through several mechanisms, including (a) allowing for expansion of pathogenic intestinal bacteria, (b) priming the immune system for a robust pro-inflammatory response, and (c) decreasing production of beneficial microbial products such as short-chain fatty acids. Second, once sepsis is established, gut microbiome disruption worsens and increases susceptibility to end-organ dysfunction. Third, there is limited evidence that microbiome-based therapeutics, including probiotics and selective digestive decontamination, may decrease sepsis risk and improve sepsis outcomes in select patient populations, but concerns about safety have limited uptake. Case reports of a different microbiome-based therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, have shown correlation with gut microbial structure restoration and decreased inflammatory response, but these results require further validation. While much of the evidence linking the gut microbiome and sepsis has been established in pre-clinical studies, clinical evidence is lacking in many areas. To address this, we outline a potential research agenda for further investigating the interaction between the gut microbiome and sepsis.

## The promise and challenge of cancer microbiome research.
 03.06.2020, _SS Manzoor, A Doedens, MB Burns_


Many microbial agents have been implicated as contributors to cancer genesis and development, and the search to identify and characterize new cancer-related organisms is ongoing. Modern developments in methodologies, especially culture-independent approaches, have accelerated and driven this research. Recent work has shed light on the multifaceted role that the community of organisms in and on the human body plays in cancer onset, development, detection, treatment, and outcome. Much remains to be discovered, however, as methodological variation and functional testing of statistical correlations need to be addressed for the field to advance.

## Antidiabetic Effects of Flavan-3-ols and Their Microbial Metabolites.
 03.06.2020, _E Márquez Campos, L Jakobs, MC Simon_


Diet is one of the pillars in the prevention and management of diabetes mellitus. Particularly, eating patterns characterized by a high consumption of foods such as fruits or vegetables and beverages such as coffee and tea could influence the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. Flavonoids, whose intake has been inversely associated with numerous negative health outcomes in the last few years, are a common constituent of these food items. Therefore, they could contribute to the observed positive effects of certain dietary habits in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Of all the different flavonoid subclasses, flavan-3-ols are consumed the most in the European region. However, a large proportion of the ingested flavan-3-ols is not absorbed. Therefore, the flavan-3-ols enter the large intestine where they become available to the colonic bacteria and are metabolized by the microbiota. For this reason, in addition to the parent compounds, the colonic metabolites of flavan-3-ols could take part in the prevention and management of diabetes. The aim of this review is to present the available literature on the effect of both the parent flavan-3-ol compounds found in different food sources as well as the specific microbial metabolites of diabetes in order to better understand their potential role in the prevention and treatment of the disease.

## Longitudinal analysis reveals transition barriers between dominant ecological states in the gut microbiome.
 30.05.2020, _R Levy, AT Magis, JC Earls, O Manor, T Wilmanski, J Lovejoy, SM Gibbons, GS Omenn, L Hood, ND Price_


The Pioneer 100 Wellness Project involved quantitatively profiling 108 participants' molecular physiology over time, including genomes, gut microbiomes, blood metabolomes, blood proteomes, clinical chemistries, and data from wearable devices. Here, we present a longitudinal analysis focused specifically around the Pioneer 100 gut microbiomes. We distinguished a subpopulation of individuals with reduced gut diversity, elevated relative abundance of the genus Prevotella, and reduced levels of the genus Bacteroides We found that the relative abundances of Bacteroides and Prevotella were significantly correlated with certain serum metabolites, including omega-6 fatty acids. Primary dimensions in distance-based redundancy analysis of clinical chemistries explained 18.5% of the variance in bacterial community composition, and revealed a Bacteroides/Prevotella dichotomy aligned with inflammation and dietary markers. Finally, longitudinal analysis of gut microbiome dynamics within individuals showed that direct transitions between Bacteroides-dominated and Prevotella-dominated communities were rare, suggesting the presence of a barrier between these states. One implication is that interventions seeking to transition between Bacteroides- and Prevotella-dominated communities will need to identify permissible paths through ecological state-space that circumvent this apparent barrier.

Populations of closely related microbial strains can be simultaneously present in bacterial communities such as the human gut microbiome. We recently developed a de novo genome assembly approach that uses read cloud sequencing to provide more complete microbial genome drafts, enabling precise differentiation and tracking of strain-level dynamics across metagenomic samples. In this case study, we present a proof-of-concept using read cloud sequencing to describe bacterial strain diversity in the gut microbiome of one hematopoietic cell transplantation patient over a 2-month time course and highlight temporal strain variation of gut microbes during therapy. The treatment was accompanied by diet changes and administration of multiple immunosuppressants and antimicrobials.

## Comparative assessment of faecal microbial composition and metabonome of swine, farmers and human control.
 03.06.2020, _SC Tan, CW Chong, IKS Yap, KL Thong, CSJ Teh_


The gastrointestinal tract of humans and swine consist of a wide range of bacteria which interact with hosts metabolism. Due to the differences in co-evolution and co-adaptation, a large fraction of the gut microbiome is host-specific. In this study, we evaluated the effect of close human-animal interaction to the faecal metagenome and metabonome of swine, farmer and human control. Three distinct clusters were observed based on T-RFLP-derived faecal microbial composition. However, 16S-inferred faecal microbiota and metabolic profiles showed that only human control was significantly different from the swine (P &lt; 0.05). The metabonome of farmers and human controls were highly similar. Notably, higher trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and butyrate were detected in human control and swine, respectively. The relative abundance of TMAO was positively correlated with Prevotella copri. Overall, we compared and established the relationship between the metabolites and microbiota composition of swine, farmers and human control. Based on the data obtained, we deduced that long term occupational exposure to swine and farm environment had affected the gut bacterial composition of farmers. Nonetheless, the effect was less prominent in the metabolite profiles, suggesting the gut bacteria expressed high functional plasticity and are therefore resilience to the level of community shift detected.

## Matching between Donors and Ulcerative Colitis Patients Is Important for Long-Term Maintenance after Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.
 03.06.2020, _K Okahara, D Ishikawa, K Nomura, S Ito, K Haga, M Takahashi, T Shibuya, T Osada, A Nagahara_


We previously demonstrated that fresh fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) following triple antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin, fosfomycin, metronidazole (AFM); A-FMT) resulted in effective colonization of Bacteroidetes species, leading to short-term clinical response in ulcerative colitis (UC). Its long-term efficacy and criteria for donor selection are unknown. Here, we analyzed the long-term efficacy of A-FMT compared to AFM monotherapy (mono-AFM). AFM was administered to patients with mild to severe UC for 2 weeks until 2 days before fresh FMT. Clinical response and efficacy maintenance were defined by the decrease and no exacerbation in clinical activity index. The population for intention-to-treat analysis comprised 92 patients (A-FMT, n = 55; mono-AFM, n = 37). Clinical response was observed at 4 weeks post-treatment (A-FMT, 56.3%; mono-AFM, 48.6%). Maintenance rate of responders at 24 months post-treatment was significantly higher with A-FMT than mono-AFM (p = 0.034). Significant differences in maintenance rate according to the age difference between donors and patients were observed. Additionally, sibling FMT had a significantly higher maintenance rate than parent-child FMT. Microbial analysis of patients who achieved long-term maintenance showed that some exhibited similarity to their donors, particularly Bacteroidetes species. Thus, A-FMT exhibited long-term efficacy. Therefore, matching between donors and UC patients may be helpful in effectively planning the FMT regimen.

## Alterations in Vaginal Microbiota and Associated Metabolome in Women with Recurrent Implantation Failure.
 03.06.2020, _M Fu, X Zhang, Y Liang, S Lin, W Qian, S Fan_


Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) refers to repeated failure to become pregnant after transferring embryos with normal morphology. However, the pathogenesis of RIF remains unrevealed, especially for those without any pathological features. In this study, we characterized the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes of patients with unexplained RIF, while patients who achieved clinical pregnancy in the first frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle were used as controls. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the vaginal microbiota, the vaginal Lactobacillus showed a significant positive correlation with the pregnancy rate, and the RIF group presented higher microbial α-diversity than the control group (P value = 0.016). The metabolomic profile identified 2,507 metabolites, of which 37 were significantly different between the two groups (P value &lt; 0.05, variable importance for the projection [VIP] &gt; 1). Among them, 2',3-cyclic UMP and inositol phosphate were the top two metabolites that were higher in the RIF group, while glycerophospholipids and benzopyran were important metabolites that were lower in the RIF group. A lack of lysobisphosphatidic acid and prostaglandin metabolized from glycerophospholipids will lead to deferred implantation and embryo crowding. Benzopyran, as a selective estrogen receptor modulator, may affect the outcome of pregnancy. All of the changes in metabolite profiles may result in or from the differential microbiota compositions in RIF patients. In conclusion, significant differences were presented in the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes between patients with unexplained RIF and women who became pregnant in the first FET cycle. For the first time, this study elaborates the possible pathogenesis of RIF by investigating the vaginal microbiota and metabolites in RIF patients.IMPORTANCEIn vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) is now widely applied for treating infertility, and unexplained recurrent implantation failure (RIF) has become a substantial challenge. We hypothesize that vaginal microbial dysbiosis is associated with RIF, as it is linked to many female reproductive diseases. In this study, we characterized the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes of patients with unexplained RIF, while patients who achieved clinical pregnancy in the first IVF cycle were set as controls. In general, significant differences were discovered in the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes between the two groups. This study is the first detailed elaboration of the vaginal microbiota and metabolites associated with RIF. We believe that our findings will inspire researchers to consider the dynamics of microbiomes related to the microenvironment as a critical feature for future studies of nosogenesis not only for RIF but also for other reproductive diseases.

Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) suffer from pancreatic insufficiency, lipid malabsorption and gastrointestinal complaints, next to progressive pulmonary disease. Altered mucosal homoeostasis due to malfunctioning chloride channels results in an adapted microbial composition of the gastrointestinal and the respiratory tract. Additionally, antibiotic treatment has the potential to distort resident microbial communities dramatically. This study aims to investigate early life development of the gut microbial community composition of children with CF compared to healthy infants and to study the independent effects of antibiotics taking into account other clinical and lifestyle factors.

## Altered gut microbiota in infants is associated with respiratory syncytial virus disease severity.
 03.06.2020, _JN Harding, D Siefker, L Vu, D You, J DeVincenzo, JF Pierre, SA Cormier_


Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the number one cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants. There are still no vaccines or specific antiviral therapies against RSV, mainly due to the inadequate understanding of RSV pathogenesis. Recent data suggest a role for gut microbiota community structure in determining RSV disease severity. Our objective was to determine the gut microbial profile associated with severe RSV patients, which could be used to help identify at-risk patients and develop therapeutically protective microbial assemblages that may stimulate immuno-protection.

## Ecological succession in the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy and birth.

The mother's vaginal microbiota represents the first microbes to which a child is exposed when delivered vaginally. However, little is known about the composition and development of the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy and birth. Here, we analyzed the vaginal microbiota of 57 women in pregnancy week 24, 36 and at birth after rupture of membranes but before delivery, and further compared the composition with that of the gut and airways of the 1-week-old child. The vaginal community structure had dramatic changes in bacterial diversity and taxonomic distribution, yet carried an individual-specific signature. The relative abundance of most bacterial taxa increased stepwise from week 24 of pregnancy until birth, with a gradual decline of Lactobacillus. Mother-to-child vertical transfer, as suggested by sharing, was modest, with the strongest transfer being for Clostridiales followed by Lactobacillales and Enterobacteriales. In conclusion, late gestation is associated with an increase in maternal vaginal microbiota diversity, and vaginal bacteria at birth only modestly predict the composition of the neonatal microbiota.

## Host genotype and exercise exhibit species-level selection for members of the gut bacterial communities in the mouse digestive system.
 03.06.2020, _RA Dowden, LR McGuinness, PJ Wisniewski, SC Campbell, JJ Guers, M Oydanich, SF Vatner, MM Häggblom, LJ Kerkhof_


The mammalian gut microbiome can potentially impact host health and disease state. It is known that the mouse-genome, eating-behavior, and exercise-status promotes higher taxonomic rank-level alterations (e.g. family to phyla-level) of the gut microbiota. Here, host genotype or activity status was investigated to determine if selection of individual bacterial species or strains could be discerned within the murine digestive system. For this study, the fecal bacterial community of adenylyl cyclase 5 knock-out (AC5KO, n = 7) mice or their wild-type (WT, n = 10) littermates under exercise or sedentary conditions were profiled by sequencing rRNA operons. AC5KO mice were chosen since this genotype displays enhanced longevity/exercise capacity and protects against cardiovascular/metabolic disease. Profiling of rRNA operons using the Oxford MinION yielded 65,706 2-D sequences (after size selection of 3.7-5.7 kb) which were screened against an NCBI 16S rRNA gene database. These sequences were binned into 1,566 different best BLAST hits (BBHs) and counted for each mouse sample. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of the gut microbial community demonstrated clustering by physical activity (p = 0.001) but not by host genotype. Additionally, sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that different bacterial species (closely related to Muribaculum intestinale and Parasutterella excrementihominis) inhabit AC5KO or WT mice depending on activity status. Other bacterial species of the gut microbiota did not follow such patterning (e.g. Turicibacter sanguinis and Turicimonas muris). Our results support the need of improved taxonomic resolution for better characterization of bacterial communities to deepen our understanding of the role of the gut microbiome on host health.

## Association of gut microbiota composition and function with an aged rat model of senile osteoporosis using 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing analysis.
 03.06.2020, _S Ma, J Qin, Y Hao, L Fu_


Recently, more interest has been paid to the association between bone mass and gut microecological dysbiosis. The results of clinical studies comparing gut microbiota (GM) in osteoporosis patients have been inconsistent due to different inclusion and exclusion criteria. To date, the association between the GM and senile osteoporosis remains poorly understood. Here, we utilized an aged rat model (22 months old) of senile osteoporosis to study the association of the composition and function of the GM with osteoporosis by 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing. The results showed that there was a significant reduction in alpha diversity and the F/B (Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes) ratio in aged rats. At the genus level, the enrichment of Helicobacter was potentially related to osteoporosis as a risk factor. Metagenomics results based on two databases indicated that shifts in the GM contribute to senile osteoporosis through metabolic pathways and subsequent immune disorders. In conclusion, our study reveals the association of gut microbiota composition and function with senile osteoporosis in an aged rat model in a brand new way, and variations in the GM might contribute to senile osteoporosis through metabolic pathways.

## Using soil bacterial communities to predict physico-chemical variables and soil quality.
 03.06.2020, _SM Hermans, HL Buckley, BS Case, F Curran-Cournane, M Taylor, G Lear_


Soil ecosystems consist of complex interactions between biological communities and physico-chemical variables, all of which contribute to the overall quality of soils. Despite this, changes in bacterial communities are ignored by most soil monitoring programs, which are crucial to ensure the sustainability of land management practices. We applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the bacterial community composition of over 3000 soil samples from 606 sites in New Zealand. Sites were classified as indigenous forests, exotic forest plantations, horticulture, or pastoral grasslands; soil physico-chemical variables related to soil quality were also collected. The composition of soil bacterial communities was then used to predict the land use and soil physico-chemical variables of each site.

## Analysis of bacterial and archaeal communities associated with Fogo volcanic soils of different ages.
 28.05.2020, _C Biderre-Petit, C Hochart, H Gardon, E Dugat-Bony, S Terrat, I Jouan-Dufournel, R Paris_


Basaltic rocks play a significant role in CO2 sequestration from the atmosphere during their weathering. Moreover, the primary microorganisms that colonize them, by providing mineral elements and nutrients, are shown to promote growth of diverse heterotrophic communities and plants, therefore positively impacting Earth's long-term climate balance. However, the first steps of microbial colonization and subsequent rock weathering remain poorly understood, especially regarding microbial communities over a chronological sequence. Here, we analyzed the microbial communities inhabiting the soil developed in crevices on lava flows derived from different eruptions on Fogo Island. Investigated soils show typically low carbon and nitrogen content and are relatively similar to one another regarding their phylogenetic composition, and similar to what was recorded in large soil surveys with dominance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Moreover, our results suggest a stronger effect of the organic carbon than the lava flow age in shaping microbial communities as well as the possibility of exogenous sources of bacteria as important colonizers. Furthermore, archaea reach up to 8.4% of the total microbial community, dominated by the Soil Crenarchaeotic Group, including the ammonium-oxidizer Candidatus Nitrososphaera sp. Therefore, this group might be largely responsible for ammonia oxidation under the environmental conditions found on Fogo.

## Effect of probiotics on the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis after chemotherapy: systematic review and meta-analysis of pre-clinical studies.
 03.06.2020, _WG Lima, RM Pessoa, KD Vital, IKTM Takenaka, VN Cardoso, SOA Fernandes_


Gastrointestinal mucositis (GIM) is an inflammation caused by antitumor therapy, especially after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Currently in the clinical practice, only palliative measures are taken to treat GIM, representing the main clinical limitation in the management of this condition. Several studies have highlighted the potential benefits of probiotics for the management of GIM, but the actual role of these microorganisms in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis remains elusive. In this context, here we aimed to realise a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of probiotics on experimental GIM. The meta-analysis showed that probiotics significantly suppressed the body weight loss related to GIM in rodents (95% confidence interval (CI): -2.67 to -0.70; I2=98%, P&lt;0.00). Subgroup analysis showed that pre-treatment (≥7 days before chemotherapy) (95% CI: -8.84 to -0.17; I2=98%, P&lt;0.04) with a high dose of probiotics (≥ 109 cfu/day) (95% CI: -2.58 to -0.28; I2=98%, P&lt;0.00) comprising two or more microorganism species (95% CI: -6.49 to -0.28; I2=96%, P=0.03) remedied GIM more effectively. It was also revealed that fungi (specifically Saccharomyces boullardii) are more effective in remedying GIM than bacteria (P=0.03 vs P&lt;0.00), and the mouse models are more receptive than rats to the enteroprotective effects of probiotics (95% CI: -4.76, -0.69; I2=97%, P=0.01). Qualitative analyses highlighted that probiotics suppress GIM through several mechanisms; they reduce the intestinal permeability, suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokine production while stimulating production and secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, inhibit the signalling pathways coupled to inflammation and apoptosis, accelerate the proliferation of enterocytes, reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species, and help maintain the protective mucus layer. In conclusion, this review highlights the therapeutic benefits of probiotics in experimental GIM.
