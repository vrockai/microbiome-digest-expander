During the last decade, probiotic research has progressed considerably and significant advances have been made in the selection and characterization of specific probiotic strains. The most studied probiotics belong to Lactobacillus genera. In this study, eighty Lactobacillus isolated from healthy women tolerated low pH and were able to grow in the presence of bile salts. RAPD PCR technique resulted in thirty-eight different types. Then, these isolates were evaluated based on adhesion capacity, antibiotic susceptibility and tolerance in simulated gastrointestinal tract. Species specific PCR and detection of bacteriocin related genes were also examined. Among the isolates, five strains were identified as Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus NO21, Lacticaseibacillus casei NO1, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NO4, Lactobacillus acidophilus NO7 and Lactobacillus gasseri NO38 presented acceptable antibiotic susceptibility pattern. Further analysis showed antimicrobial activity of Lacticaseibacillus culture against various bacterial pathogens and real-time PCR showed all five strains were able to prevent the colonization of bacterial pathogens. All five selected strains produced organic acids, hydrogen peroxide and were resistant to the spermicide. In addition, they lacked hemolytic activity with the ability of hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with pathogens. These results suggest that the vaginal microbiome could be a good source for the isolation of probiotics and the strains of this study may be considered as good probiotics candidates.

## Protective Effects of Natural Polysaccharides on Intestinal Barrier Injury: A Review.
 27.01.2022, _J Huo, Z Wu, W Sun, Z Wang, J Wu, M Huang, B Wang, B Sun_


_Humans, Intestinal Diseases, Intestinal Mucosa, Intestines, Polysaccharides, Tight Junction Proteins, Tight Junctions_
Owing to their minimal side effects and effective protection from oxidative stress, inflammation, and malignant growth, natural polysaccharides (NPs) are a potential adjuvant therapy for several diseases caused by intestinal barrier injury (IBI). More studies are accumulating on the protective effects of NPs with respect to IBI, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, this review aims to represent current studies that investigate the protective effects of NPs on IBI by directly maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier integrity (inhibiting oxidative stress, regulating inflammatory cytokine expression, and increasing tight junction protein expression) and indirectly regulating intestinal immunity and microbiota. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying IBI development are briefly introduced, and the structure-activity relationships of polysaccharides with intestinal barrier protection effects are discussed. Potential developments and challenges associated with NPs exhibiting protective effects against IBI have also been highlighted to guide the application of NPs in the treatment of intestinal diseases caused by IBI.

## Nitrogen recycling via gut symbionts increases in ground squirrels over the hibernation season.
 27.01.2022, _MD Regan, E Chiang, Y Liu, M Tonelli, KM Verdoorn, SR Gugel, G Suen, HV Carey, FM Assadi-Porter_


Hibernation is a mammalian strategy that uses metabolic plasticity to reduce energy demands and enable long-term fasting. Fasting mitigates winter food scarcity but eliminates dietary nitrogen, jeopardizing body protein balance. Here, we reveal gut microbiome-mediated urea nitrogen recycling in hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). Ureolytic gut microbes incorporate urea nitrogen into metabolites that are absorbed by the host, with the nitrogen reincorporated into the squirrel's protein pool. Urea nitrogen recycling is greatest after prolonged fasting in late winter, when urea transporter abundance in gut tissue and urease gene abundance in the microbiome are highest. These results reveal a functional role for the gut microbiome during hibernation and suggest mechanisms by which urea nitrogen recycling may contribute to protein balance in other monogastric animals.

## Robust host source tracking building on the divergent and non-stochastic assembly of gut microbiomes in wild and farmed large yellow croaker.
 30.01.2022, _J Zhu, H Li, ZZ Jing, W Zheng, YR Luo, SX Chen, F Guo_


Given the lack of genetic background, the source tracking unknown individuals of fish species with both farmed and wild populations often cannot be robustly achieved. The gut microbiome, which is shaped by both deterministic and stochastic processes, can serve as a molecular marker of fish host source tracking, particularly as an alternative to the yet-to-be-established host genetic marker. A candidate for testing the feasibility is the large yellow croaker, Larimichthys crocea, which is carnivorous and ranks the top mariculture fish in China. Wild resource of this fish was depleted decades ago and might have potential problematic estimation because of escaping of farmed individuals.

## Gut Microbial Trimethylamine is Elevated in Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis and Contributes to Ethanol-Induced Liver Injury in Mice.
 29.01.2022, _RN Helsley, T Miyata, A Kadam, V Venkateshwari, N Sangwan, EC Huang, R Banerjee, AL Brown, KK Fung, W Massey, C Neumann, O Danny, LJ Osborn, RC Schugar, MR McMullen, A Bellar, KL Poulsen, A Kim, V Pathak, M Mrdjen, JT Anderson, B Willard, CJ McClain, M Mitchell, AJ McCullough, S Radaeva, B Barton, G Szabo, S Dasarathy, JC Garcia-Garcia, DM Rotroff, DS Allende, Z Wang, SL Hazen, LE Nagy, JM Brown_


There is mounting evidence that microbes resident in the human intestine contribute to diverse alcohol-associated liver diseases (ALD) including the most deadly form known as alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). However, mechanisms by which gut microbes synergize with excessive alcohol intake to promote liver injury are poorly understood. Furthermore, whether drugs that selectively target gut microbial metabolism can improve ALD has never been tested. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantify the levels of microbe and host choline co-metabolites in healthy controls and AH patients, finding elevated levels of the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) in AH. In subsequent studies, we treated mice with non-lethal bacterial choline TMA lyase (CutC/D) inhibitors to blunt gut microbe-dependent production of TMA in the context of chronic ethanol administration. Indices of liver injury were quantified by complementary RNA sequencing, biochemical, and histological approaches. In addition, we examined the impact of ethanol consumption and TMA lyase inhibition on gut microbiome structure via 16S rRNA sequencing. We show the gut microbial choline metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) is elevated in AH patients and correlates with reduced hepatic expression of the TMA oxygenase flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). Provocatively, we find that small molecule inhibition of gut microbial CutC/D activity protects mice from ethanol-induced liver injury. CutC/D inhibitor-driven improvement in ethanol-induced liver injury is associated with distinct reorganization of the gut microbiome and host liver transcriptome. The microbial metabolite TMA is elevated in patients with AH, and inhibition of TMA production from gut microbes can protect mice from ethanol-induced liver injury.

## Intestinal gluconeogenesis shapes gut microbiota, fecal and urine metabolome in mice with gastric bypass surgery.
 30.01.2022, _J Vily-Petit, A Barataud, C Zitoun, A Gautier-Stein, M Serino, G Mithieux_


Intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN), gastric bypass (GBP) and gut microbiota positively regulate glucose homeostasis and diet-induced dysmetabolism. GBP modulates gut microbiota, whether IGN could shape it has not been investigated. We studied gut microbiota and microbiome in wild type and IGN-deficient mice, undergoing GBP or not, and fed on either a normal chow (NC) or a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. We also studied fecal and urine metabolome in NC-fed mice. IGN and GBP had a different effect on the gut microbiota of mice fed with NC and HFHS diet. IGN inactivation increased abundance of Deltaproteobacteria on NC and of Proteobacteria such as Helicobacter on HFHS diet. GBP increased abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria on NC-fed WT mice and of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria on HFHS-fed WT mice. The combined effect of IGN inactivation and GBP increased abundance of Actinobacteria on NC and the abundance of Enterococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae on HFHS diet. A reduction was observed in the amounf of short-chain fatty acids in fecal (by GBP) and in both fecal and urine (by IGN inactivation) metabolome. IGN and GBP, separately or combined, shape gut microbiota and microbiome on NC- and HFHS-fed mice, and modify fecal and urine metabolome.

## Soil microbial community development across a 32-year coastal wetland restoration time series and the relative importance of environmental factors.
 26.01.2022, _KM Abbott, T Quirk, LM Fultz_


Soil microbes play key roles in ecosystem functioning through processes such as organic matter decomposition, nutrient and carbon cycling, and regulating vegetation structure and productivity. Coastal marshes are situated at the confluence of terrestrial and marine ecosystems; thus, their soils support abundant and diverse microbiota which facilitate globally important biogeochemical processes including nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes. With coastal marsh ecosystems threatened by relative sea level rise, subsidence, and development, mitigation for the loss of marshes is becoming commonplace. Despite the widespread implementation of marsh construction projects, little is known about the development and variability of microbial communities in created marshes. For this study, we tested the hypothesis that microbial community composition differs across created marshes of different ages and between created and natural marshes. We also hypothesized that the microbial community would be correlated with soil properties including soil organic carbon and nitrogen content, which were predicted to increase with marsh age. To test these hypotheses, we determined dominant microbial groups and environmental characteristics from six constructed marshes ranging in age from 0 to 32 years old, as well as an adjacent natural marsh. Our results revealed that microbial biomass estimates increased with marsh age except for the high elevation 20-year old marsh, yet each marsh contained a distinct microbial community composition. Across marshes, microbial community composition was significantly related to soil C:N ratio with an increase in total microbial abundance and actinomycetes and GM+ bacteria with an increase in soil C to N ratio. Additionally, shifts in dominant microbial groups were associated with differences in vegetation, elevation, and marsh age. The natural marsh community grouped more closely with younger rather than older marshes suggesting age is less important than environmental conditions. This study shows that microbial communities are not homogenized across restoration sites and do not necessarily converge to be similar to natural marshes over time. Local biotic and environmental conditions were correlated with microbial compositions, yet in seemingly similar conditions, microbial groups also differed. The effect of differences in microbial compositions on ecological functions are yet to be fully understood.

## Emerging investigator series: microplastic sources, fate, toxicity, detection, and interactions with micropollutants in aquatic ecosystems - a review of reviews.
 26.01.2022, _M Ateia, G Ersan, MG Alalm, DC Boffito, T Karanfil_


Hundreds of review studies have been published focusing on microplastics (MPs) and their environmental impacts. With the microbiota colonization of MPs being firmly established, MPs became an important carrier for contaminants to step inside the food web all the way up to humans. Thus, the continuous feed of MPs into the ecosystem has sparked a multitude of scientific concerns about their toxicity, characterization, and interactions with microorganisms and other contaminants. The reports of common subthemes have agreed about many findings and research gaps but also showed contradictions about others. To unravel these equivocal conflicts, we herein compile all the major findings and analyze the paramount discrepancies among these review papers. Furthermore, we systematically reviewed all the highlights, research gaps, concerns, and future needs. The covered focus areas of MPs' literature include the sources, occurrence, fate, existence, and removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), toxicity, interaction with microbiota, sampling, characterization, data quality, and interaction with other co-contaminants. This study reveals that many mechanisms of MPs' behavior in aquatic environments like degradation and interaction with microbiota are yet to be comprehended. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical need to standardize methods and parameters for MP characterization to improve the comparability and reproducibility of the incoming research.

## Alternating Dual-Collision Energy Scanning Mass Spectrometry Approach: Discovery of Novel Microbial Bile-Acid Conjugates.
 27.01.2022, _QF Zhu, YZ Wang, N An, JD Hao, PC Mei, YL Bai, YN Hu, PR Bai, YQ Feng_


Bile acids (BAs) are a type of gut microbiota-host cometabolites with abundant structural diversity, and they play critical roles in maintaining host-microbiota homeostasis. In this study, we developed a new N-(4-aminomethylphenyl) pyridinium (AMPP) derivatization-assisted alternating dual-collision energy scanning mass spectrometry (AMPP-dual-CE MS) method for the profiling of BAs derived from host-gut microbiota cometabolism in mice. Using the proposed method, we discovered two new types of amino acid conjugations (alanine conjugation and proline conjugation) and acetyl conjugation with host BAs, for the first time, from mouse intestine contents and feces. Additionally, we also determined and identified nine new leucine- and phenylalanine-conjugated BAs. These findings broaden our knowledge of the composition of the BA pool and provide insight into the mechanism of host-gut microbiota cometabolism of BAs.
