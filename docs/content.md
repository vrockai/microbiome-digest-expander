## Enhancing supports to children of incarcerated parents: Introducing trauma informed training to church mentors.
 14.05.2021, _K Hays, K Flores-Carter, J Costello, R Ellis_


A child who has a parent incarcerated is likely to experience a number of life challenges including school failure, poverty, substance abuse, and justice system involvement. The negative outcomes associated with having a parent incarcerated disproportionately expose children to adverse childhood events (ACE's) which have been associated with higher morbidity and mortality. However, engagement with caring adults who can provide both practical and spiritual mentorship can increase a child's resilience and buffer the impact of these negative outcomes. Church-based mentors have the capacity to provide support to this population when adequately trained in trauma-informed responses. This study describes Camp Agape California (CAC), a church-based mentoring program for children with an incarcerated parent. Specifically, this study describes the development and implementation of a trauma focused mentorship training purposed to equip church members to better meet the needs of this vulnerable population. Seventy-six volunteer mentors from various churches participated in the training and completed the post-training survey. Results suggest that the trauma informed training was effective at increasing knowledge and self-efficacy and was identified as being relevant to the mentor role. Implications for the utility of church-based mentorship for vulnerable populations are explored.

## Reconstruction of ancient microbial genomes from the human gut.
 13.05.2021, _MC Wibowo, Z Yang, M Borry, A Hübner, KD Huang, BT Tierney, S Zimmerman, F Barajas-Olmos, C Contreras-Cubas, H García-Ortiz, A Martínez-Hernández, JM Luber, P Kirstahler, T Blohm, FE Smiley, R Arnold, SA Ballal, SJ Pamp, J Russ, F Maixner, O Rota-Stabelli, N Segata, K Reinhard, L Orozco, C Warinner, M Snow, S LeBlanc, AD Kostic_


Loss of gut microbial diversity1-6 in industrial populations is associated with chronic diseases7, underscoring the importance of studying our ancestral gut microbiome. However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000-2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.

## Sediment microbiota in polyculture of shrimp and fish pattern is distinctive from those in monoculture intensive shrimp or fish ponds.
 14.05.2021, _S Zeng, D Wei, D Hou, H Wang, J Liu, S Weng, J He, Z Huang_


Sediment microbial community plays a crucial role in aquaculture ecosystem. In aquaculture practice, rather than monoculture intensive shrimp (IS) or intensive fish (IF) patterns, polyculture of shrimp and fish (PolySF) pattern leads to a more reliable production. However, knowledge is still limited about the characteristics of sediment microbiota and its potential functions in the PolySF ponds compared to monoculture patterns (IS and IF). Herein, we collected sediment samples from these three patterns in seven cities to evaluate microbial variations among patterns. The highest oxidation reduction potential (ORP), total phosphate (TP) and total organic carbon (TOC) were detected in the PolySF pattern, representing a relatively less anoxic environment, while the highest iron (Fe) was detected in IS pattern. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum among three patterns, followed by Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi. The microbial alpha diversity in the PolySF was higher than those in the IF, but lower than those in the IS. Microbial communities of these three patterns were significantly distinct from each other, and 23 distinguished taxa for each pattern were further characterized. In additional, the relative abundances of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and carbon fixation pathways were markedly shifted. Moreover, ORP, TOC and Fe were the shaping factors for sediment microbiota, which significantly varied among three patterns. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that sediment microbial communities in the PolySF were distinctive from those in the IS and IF, which enlarged our understanding for the underlying mechanism of advances in the PolySF pattern from ecological perspective.

## Mechanical biofilm disruption causes microbial and immunological shifts in periodontitis patients.
 11.05.2021, _W Johnston, BT Rosier, A Artacho, M Paterson, K Piela, C Delaney, JL Brown, G Ramage, A Mira, S Culshaw_


Periodontitis is characterized by subgingival biofilm dysbiosis, inflammation and tissue destruction. Current treatment involves mechanical biofilm disruption known as non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). This study sought to characterise the impact of treatment on microbial diversity and overall community, and the parallel impact on host inflammation in the oral cavity. Fourty-two periodontitis patients were included in this study, with periodontal clinical parameters, subgingival plaque and saliva samples collected at baseline and 90 days after treatment. Salivary cytokines were quantified, and subgingival plaque was analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing. After treatment, there were marked health-associated alterations in microbial composition and diversity, including differential abundance of 42 genera and 61 species. These changes were accompanied by substantial clinical improvement (pockets ≥ 5 mm, 27.50% to 9.00%, p &lt; 0.001) and a decrease in salivary IL-1β (p &lt; 0.001)-a putative marker of periodontal inflammation. Despite significant reductions in disease associated anaerobes, several genera (Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Tanenerella, Treponema) remained present and formed a distinct subnetwork associated with residual disease. Collectively, this study shows that current periodontal treatment results in partial restoration of a healthy microbial ecosystem, but features of biofilm dysbiosis and host inflammation remain in some patients, which were surprisingly independent of clinical response.

## The Complex Link between the Female Genital Microbiota, Genital Infections, and Inflammation.
 04.05.2021, _S Dabee, JS Passmore, R Heffron, HB Jaspan_


The female genital tract microbiota is part of a complex ecosystem influenced by several physiological, genetic, and behavioral factors. It is uniquely linked to a woman's mucosal immunity and plays a critical role in the regulation of genital inflammation. A vaginal microbiota characterized by a high abundance of lactobacilli and low overall bacterial diversity is associated with lower inflammation. On the other hand, a more diverse microbiota is linked to high mucosal inflammation levels, a compromised genital epithelial barrier, and an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections and other conditions. Several bacterial taxa such as Gardnerella spp., Prevotella spp., Sneathia spp., and Atopobium spp. are well known to have adverse effects; however, the definitive cause of this microbial dysbiosis is yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of this review is to discuss the multiple ways in which the microbiota influences the overall genital inflammatory milieu and to explore the causes and consequences of this inflammatory response. While there is abundant evidence linking a diverse genital microbiota to elevated inflammation, understanding the risk factors and mechanisms through which it affects genital health is essential. A robust appreciation of these factors is important for identifying effective prevention and treatment strategies.

## Urinary prostaglandin E2 as a biomarker for recurrent UTI in postmenopausal women.
 11.05.2021, _T Ebrahimzadeh, A Kuprasertkul, ML Neugent, KC Lutz, JL Fuentes, J Gadhvi, F Khan, C Zhang, BM Sharon, K Orth, Q Li, PE Zimmern, NJ De Nisco_


Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common adult bacterial infections and exhibits high recurrence rates, especially in postmenopausal women. Studies in mouse models suggest that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-mediated inflammation sensitizes the bladder to recurrent UTI (rUTI). However, COX-2-mediated inflammation has not been robustly studied in human rUTI. We used human cohorts to assess urothelial COX-2 production and evaluate its product, PGE2, as a biomarker for rUTI in postmenopausal women. We found that the percentage of COX-2-positive cells was elevated in inflamed versus uninflamed bladder regions. We analyzed the performance of urinary PGE2 as a biomarker for rUTI in a controlled cohort of 92 postmenopausal women and PGE2 consistently outperformed all other tested clinical variables as a predictor of rUTI status. Furthermore, time-to-relapse analysis indicated that the risk of rUTI relapse was 3.6 times higher in women with above median urinary PGE2 levels than with below median levels. Taken together, these data suggest that urinary PGE2 may be a clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for rUTI in postmenopausal women.

## Perinatal exposure to tetracycline contributes to lasting developmental effects on offspring.
 14.05.2021, _EM Hill, CD Howard, TL Bale, E Jašarević_


For more than 30 years, the tetracycline on/off system of inducible gene expression has been leveraged to study disease mechanisms across many research areas, especially that of metabolism and neuroscience. This system requires acute or chronic exposure to tetracycline derivatives, such as doxycycline, to manipulate gene expression in a temporal and tissue-specific manner, with exposure often being restricted to gestational and early developmental windows. Despite evidence showing that early life antibiotic exposure has adverse effects on gut microbiota, metabolism, physiology, immunity and behavior, little is known regarding the lasting impact of doxycycline treatment on relevant outcomes in experimental offspring.

## Board Certification and Surgeon's Fee for Aesthetic Rhinoplasty.
 14.05.2021, _EA Blasberg, J Golden, S Rubin, JH Spiegel_


Elective rhinoplasty surgeons' fees vary considerably and are influenced by geographic surgeon density, surgeon's experience, local economic factors, patient demand, and other factors. The American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the American Society of Plastic Surgery, and other organizations certify physicians who profess expertise in rhinoplasty. We sought to determine if specific board certification or experience correlates with higher rhinoplasty fee. An internet search was conducted of seven U.S. metropolitan areas using the search terms "rhinoplasty and "city name." Top search results were surveyed for rhinoplasty fee, years of experience, annual volume of rhinoplasties, board certification, and other demographic data. Using both univariate and multivariate comparisons, the data were analyzed for forces having significant correlation with rhinoplasty fee. Sixty-seven surgeons were included in the study. The average price for ABFPRS certified surgeons was significantly higher than surgeons with other board certifications ($10,550.00 ± 3,722.10 compared with $8,524.50 ± 2816.30, p = 0.0142). The volume of rhinoplasties performed per year was also significantly correlated with fee charged for rhinoplasty by the surgeon (r = 0.37773, p = 0.032). Additionally, surgeons practicing on the West Coast (LA) charged significantly higher fees ($12,059.09 ± 3014.53) compared with the Mid United States. ($8316.07 ± 2449.43) and the East Coast ($9152.86 ± 3639.78) (p = 0.0047). On multivariable linear regression, controlling for volume of rhinoplasty and region of the United States, ABFPRS certified surgeons charged significantly higher fees for rhinoplasty (p = 0.0230). ABFPRS board certification correlates with higher fees charged for rhinoplasty. Other important variables include surgeon's annual rhinoplasty and practice on the West Coast.

## A method for achieving complete microbial genomes and improving bins from metagenomics data.
 07.05.2021, _LM Lui, TN Nielsen, AP Arkin_


Metagenomics facilitates the study of the genetic information from uncultured microbes and complex microbial communities. Assembling complete genomes from metagenomics data is difficult because most samples have high organismal complexity and strain diversity. Some studies have attempted to extract complete bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes and often focus on species with circular genomes so they can help confirm completeness with circularity. However, less than 100 circularized bacterial and archaeal genomes have been assembled and published from metagenomics data despite the thousands of datasets that are available. Circularized genomes are important for (1) building a reference collection as scaffolds for future assemblies, (2) providing complete gene content of a genome, (3) confirming little or no contamination of a genome, (4) studying the genomic context and synteny of genes, and (5) linking protein coding genes to ribosomal RNA genes to aid metabolic inference in 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. We developed a semi-automated method called Jorg to help circularize small bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes using iterative assembly, binning, and read mapping. In addition, this method exposes potential misassemblies from k-mer based assemblies. We chose species of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) to focus our initial efforts because they have small genomes and are only known to have one ribosomal RNA operon. In addition to 34 circular CPR genomes, we present one circular Margulisbacteria genome, one circular Chloroflexi genome, and two circular megaphage genomes from 19 public and published datasets. We demonstrate findings that would likely be difficult without circularizing genomes, including that ribosomal genes are likely not operonic in the majority of CPR, and that some CPR harbor diverged forms of RNase P RNA. Code and a tutorial for this method is available at https://github.com/lmlui/Jorg and is available on the DOE Systems Biology KnowledgeBase as a beta app.

## Taxonomic annotation of 16S rRNA sequences of pig intestinal samples using MG-RAST and QIIME2 generated different microbiota compositions.
 11.05.2021, _J Lima, T Manning, KM Rutherford, ET Baima, RJ Dewhurst, P Walsh, R Roehe_


Environmental microbiome studies rely on fast and accurate bioinformatics tools to characterize the taxonomic composition of samples based on the 16S rRNA gene. MetaGenome Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (MG-RAST) and Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2) are two of the most popular tools available to perform this task. Their underlying algorithms differ in many aspects, and therefore the comparison of the pipelines provides insights into their best use and interpretation of the outcomes. Both of these bioinformatics tools are based on several specialized algorithms pipelined together, but whereas MG-RAST is a user-friendly webserver that clusters rRNA sequences based on their similarity to create Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU), QIIME2 employs DADA2 in the construction of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASV) by applying an error model that considers the abundance of each sequence and its similarity to other sequences. Taxonomic compositions obtained from the analyses of amplicon sequences of DNA from swine intestinal gut and faecal microbiota samples using MG-RAST and QIIME2 were compared at domain-, phylum-, family- and genus-levels in terms of richness, relative abundance and diversity. We found significant differences between the microbiota profiles obtained from each pipeline. At domain level, bacteria were relatively more abundant using QIIME2 than MG-RAST; at phylum level, seven taxa were identified exclusively by QIIME2; at family level, samples processed in QIIME2 showed higher evenness and richness (assessed by Shannon and Simpson indices). The genus-level compositions obtained from each pipeline were used in partial least squares-discriminant analyses (PLS-DA) to discriminate between sample collection sites (caecum, colon and faeces). The results showed that different genera were found to be significant for the models, based on the Variable Importance in Projection, e.g. when using sequencing data processed by MG-RAST, the three most important genera were Acetitomaculum, Ruminococcus and Methanosphaera, whereas when data was processed using QIIME2, these were Candidatus Methanomethylophilus, Sphaerochaeta and Anaerorhabdus. Furthermore, the application of differential filtering procedures before the PLS-DA revealed higher accuracy when using non-restricted datasets obtained from MG-RAST, whereas datasets obtained from QIIME2 resulted in more accurate discrimination of sample collection sites after removing genera with low relative abundances (&lt;1%) from the datasets. Our results highlight the differences in taxonomic compositions of samples obtained from the two separate pipelines, while underlining the impact on downstream analyses, such as biomarkers identification.

_Adolescent, Adult, Bayes Theorem, Child, Data Mining, Female, Humans, Hyoid Bone, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Laryngeal Cartilages, Male, Tomography, X-Ray Computed_
Objective To explore the feasibility of the CT image reconstruction of laryngeal cartilage and hyoid bone in adult age estimation using data mining methods. Methods The neck thin slice CT scans of 413 individuals aged 18 to &lt;80 years were collected and divided into test set and train set, randomly. According to grading methods such as TURK et al., all samples were graded comprehensively. The process of thyroid cartilage ossification was divided into 6 stages, the process of cricoid cartilage ossification was divided into 5 stages, and the synosteosis between the greater horn of hyoid and hyoid body was divided into 3 stages. Multiple linear regression model, support vector regression model, and Bayesian ridge regression model were developed for adult age estimation by scikit-learn 0.17 machine learning kit （Python language）. Leave-one-out cross-validation and the test set were used to further evaluate performance of the models. Results All indicators were moderately or poorly associated with age. The model with the highest accuracy in male age estimation was the support vector regression model, with a mean absolute error of 8.67 years, much higher than the other two models. The model with the highest accuracy in female adult age estimation was the support vector regression model, with a mean absolute error of 12.69 years, but its accuracy differences with the other two models had no statistical significance. Conclusion Data mining technology can improve the accuracy of adult age estimation, but the accuracy of adult age estimation based on laryngeal cartilage and hyoid bone is still not satisfactory, so it should be combined with other indicators in practice.

## Migrating from partial least squares discriminant analysis to artificial neural networks: a comparison of functionally equivalent visualisation and feature contribution tools using jupyter notebooks.
 30.12.2020, _KM Mendez, DI Broadhurst, SN Reinke_


_Discriminant Analysis, Least-Squares Analysis, Metabolomics, Neural Networks, Computer, Software_
Metabolomics data is commonly modelled multivariately using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Its success is primarily due to ease of interpretation, through projection to latent structures, and transparent assessment of feature importance using regression coefficients and Variable Importance in Projection scores. In recent years several non-linear machine learning (ML) methods have grown in popularity but with limited uptake essentially due to convoluted optimisation and interpretation. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a non-linear projection-based ML method that share a structural equivalence with PLS, and as such should be amenable to equivalent optimisation and interpretation methods.

## DNA methylation and gene expression integration in cardiovascular disease.
 14.04.2021, _G Palou-Márquez, I Subirana, L Nonell, A Fernández-Sanlés, R Elosua_


The integration of different layers of omics information is an opportunity to tackle the complexity of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and to identify new predictive biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets. Our aim was to integrate DNA methylation and gene expression data in an effort to identify biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease risk in a community-based population. We accessed data from the Framingham Offspring Study, a cohort study with data on DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip; Illumina) and gene expression (Human Exon 1.0 ST Array; Affymetrix). Using the MOFA2 R package, we integrated these data to identify biomarkers related to the risk of presenting a cardiovascular event.

## Board Certification and Surgeon's Fee for Aesthetic Rhinoplasty.
 14.05.2021, _EA Blasberg, J Golden, S Rubin, JH Spiegel_


Elective rhinoplasty surgeons' fees vary considerably and are influenced by geographic surgeon density, surgeon's experience, local economic factors, patient demand, and other factors. The American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the American Society of Plastic Surgery, and other organizations certify physicians who profess expertise in rhinoplasty. We sought to determine if specific board certification or experience correlates with higher rhinoplasty fee. An internet search was conducted of seven U.S. metropolitan areas using the search terms "rhinoplasty and "city name." Top search results were surveyed for rhinoplasty fee, years of experience, annual volume of rhinoplasties, board certification, and other demographic data. Using both univariate and multivariate comparisons, the data were analyzed for forces having significant correlation with rhinoplasty fee. Sixty-seven surgeons were included in the study. The average price for ABFPRS certified surgeons was significantly higher than surgeons with other board certifications ($10,550.00 ± 3,722.10 compared with $8,524.50 ± 2816.30, p = 0.0142). The volume of rhinoplasties performed per year was also significantly correlated with fee charged for rhinoplasty by the surgeon (r = 0.37773, p = 0.032). Additionally, surgeons practicing on the West Coast (LA) charged significantly higher fees ($12,059.09 ± 3014.53) compared with the Mid United States. ($8316.07 ± 2449.43) and the East Coast ($9152.86 ± 3639.78) (p = 0.0047). On multivariable linear regression, controlling for volume of rhinoplasty and region of the United States, ABFPRS certified surgeons charged significantly higher fees for rhinoplasty (p = 0.0230). ABFPRS board certification correlates with higher fees charged for rhinoplasty. Other important variables include surgeon's annual rhinoplasty and practice on the West Coast.
