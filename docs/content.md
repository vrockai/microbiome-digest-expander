Nature challenges microbes with change at different frequencies and demands an effective response for survival. Here, we used controlled laboratory experiments to investigate the effectiveness of different response strategies, such as post-translational modification, transcriptional regulation, and specialized versus adaptable metabolisms. For this, we inoculated replicated chemostats with an enrichment culture obtained from sulfidic stream microbiomes 16 weeks prior. The chemostats were submitted to alternatingly oxic and anoxic conditions at three frequencies, with periods of 1, 4 and 16 days. The microbial response was recorded with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. Metagenomics resolved provisional genomes of all abundant bacterial populations, mainly affiliated with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Almost all these populations maintained a steady growth rate under both redox conditions at all three frequencies of change. Our results supported three conclusions: (1) Oscillating oxic/anoxic conditions selected for generalistic species, rather than species specializing in only a single condition. (2) A high frequency of change selected for strong codon usage bias. (3) Alignment of transcriptomes and proteomes required multiple generations and was dependent on a low frequency of change.

Health disparities are driven by underlying social disadvantage and psychosocial stressors. However, how social disadvantage and psychosocial stressors lead to adverse health outcomes is unclear, particularly when exposure begins prenatally. Variations in the gut microbiome and circulating proinflammatory cytokines offer potential mechanistic pathways. Here, we interrogate the gut microbiome of mother-child dyads to compare high-versus-low prenatal social disadvantage, psychosocial stressors and maternal circulating cytokine cohorts (prospective case-control study design using gut microbiomes from 121 dyads profiled with 16 S rRNA sequencing and 89 dyads with shotgun metagenomic sequencing). Gut microbiome characteristics significantly predictive of social disadvantage and psychosocial stressors in the mothers and children indicate that different discriminatory taxa and related pathways are involved, including many species of Bifidobacterium and related pathways across several comparisons. The lowest inter-individual gut microbiome similarity was observed among high-social disadvantage/high-psychosocial stressors mothers, suggesting distinct environmental exposures driving a diverging gut microbiome assembly compared to low-social disadvantage/low-psychosocial stressors controls (P = 3.5 × 10-5 for social disadvantage, P = 2.7 × 10-15 for psychosocial stressors). Children's gut metagenome profiles at 4 months also significantly predicted high/low maternal prenatal IL-6 (P = 0.029), with many bacterial species overlapping those identified by social disadvantage and psychosocial stressors. These differences, based on maternal social and psychological status during a critical developmental window early in life, offer potentially modifiable targets to mitigate health inequities.

## Household environment and animal fecal contamination are critical modifiers of the gut microbiome and resistome in young children from rural Nicaragua.

Early life plays a vital role in the development of the gut microbiome and subsequent health. While many factors that shape the gut microbiome have been described, including delivery mode, breastfeeding, and antibiotic use, the role of household environments is still unclear. Furthermore, the development of the gut antimicrobial resistome and its role in health and disease is not well characterized, particularly in settings with water insecurity and less sanitation infrastructure.

## Recovery of the gut microbiome following enteric infection and persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes in specific microbial hosts.

Enteric pathogens cause widespread foodborne illness and are increasingly resistant to important antibiotics yet their ecological impact on the gut microbiome and resistome is not fully understood. Herein, shotgun metagenome sequencing was applied to stool DNA from 60 patients (cases) during an enteric bacterial infection and after recovery (follow-ups). Overall, the case samples harbored more antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) with greater resistome diversity than the follow-up samples (p &lt; 0.001), while follow-ups had more diverse gut microbiota (p &lt; 0.001). Although cases were primarily defined by genera Escherichia, Salmonella, and Shigella along with ARGs for multi-compound and multidrug resistance, follow-ups had a greater abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla and resistance genes for tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins, and aminoglycosides. A host-tracking analysis revealed that Escherichia was the primary bacterial host of ARGs in both cases and follow-ups, with a greater abundance occurring during infection. Eleven distinct extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes were identified during infection, with some detectable upon recovery, highlighting the potential for gene transfer within the community. Because of the increasing incidence of disease caused by foodborne pathogens and their role in harboring and transferring resistance determinants, this study enhances our understanding of how enteric infections impact human gut ecology.

## The Impacts of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation from Same Sex on the Symptoms of Ulcerative Colitis Patients.

We aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from the same sex on ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. A total of 272 UC patients were selected in the prospective clinical study, which incorporated four distinct groups, each comprising male and female patients, who were either receiving FMT or placebo, respectively. FMT was performed by sending the gut microbiota of healthy female or male adolescents to the same gender patients via gastroscope three times (one time/three weeks), and a placebo was used with an equal volume of saline. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, thick bloody stool, intestinal mucosal lesion, and Mayo scores were measured. Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were evaluated. The changes of intestinal flora were detected by the 16S rRNA sequencing. FMT reduced the scores of diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucosal lesion, and Mayo, SAS, and SDS in UC patients compared to the placebo group (p &lt; 0.05). Clostridiales and Desulfovibrionaceae were dominant in gut microbiota from male patients and were reduced after FMT. Meanwhile, the abundance of Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium was increased in the male group. Female patients had a higher abundance of Escherichia-Shigella, Desulfovibrionaceae, and Staphylococcaceae before FMT, and it was reduced after FMT. Meanwhile, the abundance of Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium was increased in the female group. There were no significant changes for the species in the corresponding placebo groups. FMT improved the UC symptoms of male and female patients, which may be associated with different gut microbiota changes.

Eimeria tenella is an obligate intracellular parasitic protozoan that invades the chicken cecum and causes coccidiosis, which induces acute lesions and weight loss. Elucidating the anticoccidial mechanism of action of green tea polyphenols could aid the development of anticoccidial drugs and resolve the problem of drug resistance in E. tenella.
