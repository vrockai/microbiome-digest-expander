## Bioactivity of Macronutrients from Chlorella in Physical Exercise.
 11.07.2023, _K Lorenzo, G Santocildes, JR Torrella, J Magalhães, T Pagès, G Viscor, JL Torres, S Ramos-Romero_


Chlorella is a marine microalga rich in proteins and containing all the essential amino acids. Chlorella also contains fiber and other polysaccharides, as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. The proportion of the different macronutrients in Chlorella can be modulated by altering the conditions in which it is cultured. The bioactivities of these macronutrients make Chlorella a good candidate food to include in regular diets or as the basis of dietary supplements in exercise-related nutrition both for recreational exercisers and professional athletes. This paper reviews current knowledge of the effects of the macronutrients in Chlorella on physical exercise, specifically their impact on performance and recovery. In general, consuming Chlorella improves both anaerobic and aerobic exercise performance as well as physical stamina and reduces fatigue. These effects seem to be related to the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic activity of all its macronutrients, while each component of Chlorella contributes its bioactivity via a specific action. Chlorella is an excellent dietary source of high-quality protein in the context of physical exercise, as dietary proteins increase satiety, activation of the anabolic mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) pathway in skeletal muscle, and the thermic effects of meals. Chlorella proteins also increase intramuscular free amino acid levels and enhance the ability of the muscles to utilize them during exercise. Fiber from Chlorella increases the diversity of the gut microbiota, which helps control body weight and maintain intestinal barrier integrity, and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which improve physical performance. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from Chlorella contribute to endothelial protection and modulate the fluidity and rigidity of cell membranes, which may improve performance. Ultimately, in contrast to several other nutritional sources, the use of Chlorella to provide high-quality protein, dietary fiber, and bioactive fatty acids may also significantly contribute to a sustainable world through the fixation of carbon dioxide and a reduction of the amount of land used to produce animal feed.

## Development of the intestinal microbiome in cystic fibrosis in early life.
 05.07.2023, _CE Price, TH Hampton, RA Valls, KE Barrack, GA O'Toole, JC Madan, MO Coker_


Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a heritable disease that causes altered physiology at mucosal sites; these changes result in chronic infections in the lung, significant gastrointestinal complications as well as dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, although the latter has been less well explored. Here, we describe the longitudinal development of the gut microbiome in a cohort of children with CF (cwCF) from birth through early childhood (0-4 years of age) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of stool samples as a surrogate for the gut microbiota. Similar to healthy populations, alpha diversity of the gut microbiome increases significantly with age, but diversity plateaus at ~2 years of age for this CF cohort. Several taxa that have been associated with dysbiosis in CF change with age toward a more healthy-like composition; notable exceptions include Akkermansia, which decreases with age, and Blautia, which increases with age. We also examined the relative abundance and prevalence of nine taxa associated with CF lung disease, several of which persist across early life, highlighting the possibility of the lung being seeded directly from the gut early in life. Finally, we applied the Crohn's Dysbiosis Index to each sample, and found that high Crohn's-associated dysbiosis early in life (&lt;2 years) was associated with significantly lower Bacteroides in samples collected from 2 to 4 years of age. Together, these data comprise an observational study that describes the longitudinal development of the CF-associated gut microbiota and suggest that early markers associated with inflammatory bowel disease may shape the later gut microbiota of cwCF. IMPORTANCE Cystic fibrosis is a heritable disease that disrupts ion transport at mucosal surfaces, causing a buildup of mucus and dysregulation of microbial communities in both the lungs and the intestines. Persons with CF are known to have dysbiotic gut microbial communities, but the development of these communities over time beginning at birth has not been thoroughly studied. Here, we describe an observation study following the development of the gut microbiome of cwCF throughout the first 4 years of life, during the critical window of both gut microbiome and immune development. Our findings indicate the possibility of the gut microbiota as a reservoir of airway pathogens and a surprisingly early indication of a microbiota associated with inflammatory bowel disease.

Men demonstrate higher incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) than women. This study aims to explain the potential causes of such sexual dimorphism in CRC from the perspective of sex-biased gut microbiota and metabolites. The results show that sexual dimorphism in colorectal tumorigenesis is observed in both ApcMin/ + mice and azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice with male mice have significantly larger and more tumors, accompanied by more impaired gut barrier function. Moreover, pseudo-germ mice receiving fecal samples from male mice or patients show more severe intestinal barrier damage and higher level of inflammation. A significant change in gut microbiota composition is found with increased pathogenic bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila and deplets probiotic Parabacteroides goldsteinii in both male mice and pseudo-germ mice receiving fecal sample from male mice. Sex-biased gut metabolites in pseudo-germ mice receiving fecal sample from CRC patients or CRC mice contribute to sex dimorphism in CRC tumorigenesis through glycerophospholipids metabolism pathway. Sexual dimorphism in tumorigenesis of CRC mouse models. In conclusion, the sex-biased gut microbiome and metabolites contribute to sexual dimorphism in CRC. Modulating sex-biased gut microbiota and metabolites could be a potential sex-targeting therapeutic strategy of CRC.

## Dietary pattern in autism increases the need for probiotic supplementation: A comprehensive narrative and systematic review on oxidative stress hypothesis.
 07.07.2023, _M Zarezadeh, M Mahmoudinezhad, B Hosseini, L Khorraminezhad, M Razaghi, E Alvandi, A Saedisomeolia_


Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are associated with specific dietary habits, including limited food selection and gastrointestinal problems, resulting in an altered gut microbiota. Autistic patients have an elevated abundance of certain gut bacteria associated with increased oxidative stress in the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotic supplementation has been shown to decrease oxidative stress in a simulated gut model, but the antioxidant effects of probiotics on the oxidative stress of the gut in autistic patients have not been directly studied. However, it is speculated that probiotic supplementation may help decrease oxidative stress in the gastrointestinal tract of autistic patients due to their specific dietary habits altering the microbiota. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases and Google Scholar were searched up to May 2023. This systematic-narrative review aims to present the latest evidence regarding the changes in eating habits of autistic children which may further increase the gut microbiota induced oxidative stress. Additionally, this review will assess the available literature on the effects of probiotic supplementation on oxidative stress parameters.

## Early-life respiratory infections and developmental immunity determine lifelong lung health.
 06.07.2023, _CM Lloyd, S Saglani_


Respiratory infections are common in infants and young children. However, the immune system develops and matures as the child grows, thus the effects of infection during this time of dynamic change may have long-term consequences. The infant immune system develops in conjunction with the seeding of the microbiome at the respiratory mucosal surface, at a time that the lungs themselves are maturing. We are now recognizing that any disturbance of this developmental trajectory can have implications for lifelong lung health. Here, we outline our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying relationships between immune and structural cells in the lung with the local microorganisms. We highlight the importance of gaining greater clarity as to what constitutes a healthy respiratory ecosystem and how environmental exposures influencing this network will aid efforts to mitigate harmful effects and restore lung immune health.

Milk production is an ancient adaptation that unites all mammals. Milk contains a microbiome that can contribute to offspring health and microbial-immunological development. We generated a comprehensive milk microbiome dataset (16S rRNA gene) for the class Mammalia, representing 47 species from all placental superorders, to determine processes structuring milk microbiomes. We show that across Mammalia, milk exposes offspring to maternal bacterial and archaeal symbionts throughout lactation. Deterministic processes of environmental selection accounted for 20% of milk microbiome assembly processes; milk microbiomes were similar from mammals with the same host superorder (Afrotheria, Laurasiathera, Euarchontoglires, and Xenarthra: 6%), environment (marine captive, marine wild, terrestrial captive, and terrestrial wild: 6%), diet (carnivore, omnivore, herbivore, and insectivore: 5%), and milk nutrient content (sugar, fat, and protein: 3%). We found that diet directly and indirectly impacted milk microbiomes, with indirect effects being mediated by milk sugar content. Stochastic processes, such as ecological drift, accounted for 80% of milk microbiome assembly processes, which was high compared to mammalian gut and mammalian skin microbiomes (69% and 45%, respectively). Even amid high stochasticity and indirect effects, our results of direct dietary effects on milk microbiomes provide support for enteromammary trafficking, representing a mechanism by which bacteria are transferred from the mother's gut to mammary gland and then to offspring postnatally. The microbial species present in milk reflect both selective pressures and stochastic processes at the host level, exemplifying various ecological and evolutionary factors acting on milk microbiomes, which, in turn, set the stage for offspring health and development.

## Shared evolutionary path in social microbiomes.
 04.07.2023, _N Frazão, I Gordo_


Social networks can influence the ecology of gut bacteria, shaping the species composition of the gut microbiome in humans and other animals. Gut commensals evolve and can adapt at a rapid pace when colonizing healthy hosts. Here, we aimed at assessing the impact of host-to-host bacterial transmission on Escherichia coli evolution in the mammalian gut. Using an in vivo experimental evolution approach in mice, we found a transmission rate of 7% (±3% 2SE) of E. coli cells per day between hosts inhabiting the same household. Consistent with the predictions of a simple population genetics model of mutation-selection-migration, the level of shared events resulting from within host evolution is greatly enhanced in co-housed mice, showing that hosts undergoing the same diet and habit are not only expected to have similar microbiome species compositions but also similar microbiome evolutionary dynamics. Furthermore, we estimated the rate of mutation accumulation of E. coli to be 3.0 × 10-3 (±0.8 × 10-3 2SE) mutations/genome/generation, irrespective of the social context of the regime. Our results reveal the impact of bacterial migration across hosts in shaping the adaptive evolution of new strains colonizing gut microbiomes.

Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) exhibit compositional changes in their gut microbiome, which represents a potential therapeutic target. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are microbiome-targeted therapies that have been proposed as treatment for NAFLD. We aim to systematically review the effects of these therapies in liver-related outcomes of NAFLD patients.

Understanding how the host's microbiome shapes phenotypes and participates in the host response to selection is fundamental for evolutionists and animal and plant breeders. Currently, selection for resilience is considered a critical step in improving the sustainability of livestock systems. Environmental variance (V E), the within-individual variance of a trait, has been successfully used as a proxy for animal resilience. Selection for reduced V E could effectively shift gut microbiome composition; reshape the inflammatory response, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels; and drive animal resilience. This study aimed to determine the gut microbiome composition underlying the V E of litter size (LS), for which we performed a metagenomic analysis in two rabbit populations divergently selected for low (n = 36) and high (n = 34) V E of LS. Partial least square-discriminant analysis and alpha- and beta-diversity were computed to determine the differences in gut microbiome composition among the rabbit populations.

_Microbiota, Bacteria, Ecology, Arabidopsis, Plant Leaves_
Resource allocation affects the structure of microbiomes, including those associated with living hosts. Understanding the degree to which this dependency determines interspecies interactions may advance efforts to control host-microbiome relationships. We combined synthetic community experiments with computational models to predict interaction outcomes between plant-associated bacteria. We mapped the metabolic capabilities of 224 leaf isolates from Arabidopsis thaliana by assessing the growth of each strain on 45 environmentally relevant carbon sources in vitro. We used these data to build curated genome-scale metabolic models for all strains, which we combined to simulate &gt;17,500 interactions. The models recapitulated outcomes observed in planta with &gt;89% accuracy, highlighting the role of carbon utilization and the contributions of niche partitioning and cross-feeding in the assembly of leaf microbiomes.

## Microeukaryotic predators shape the wastewater microbiome.
 08.07.2023, _N Heck, J Freudenthal, K Dumack_


The physicochemical parameters that shape the prokaryotic community composition in wastewater have been extensively studied. In contrast, it is poorly understood whether and how biotic interactions affect the prokaryotic community composition in wastewater. We used metatranscriptomics data from a bioreactor sampled weekly over 14 months to investigate the wastewater microbiome, including often neglected microeukaryotes. Our analysis revealed that while prokaryotes are unaffected by seasonal changes in water temperature, they are impacted by a seasonal, temperature-induced change in the microeukaryotic community. Our findings suggest that selective predation pressure exerted by microeukaryotes is a significant factor shaping the prokaryotic community in wastewater. This study underscores the importance of investigating the entire wastewater microbiome to develop a comprehensive understanding of wastewater treatment.

## Functional and sequence-based metagenomics to uncover carbohydrate-degrading enzymes from composting samples.
 07.07.2023, _C Santos-Pereira, J Sousa, ÂMA Costa, AO Santos, T Rito, P Soares, R Franco-Duarte, SC Silvério, LR Rodrigues_


The renewable, abundant , and low-cost nature of lignocellulosic biomass can play an important role in the sustainable production of bioenergy and several added-value bioproducts, thus providing alternative solutions to counteract the global energetic and industrial demands. The efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass greatly relies on the catalytic activity of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). Finding novel and robust biocatalysts, capable of being active under harsh industrial conditions, is thus imperative to achieve an economically feasible process. In this study, thermophilic compost samples from three Portuguese companies were collected, and their metagenomic DNA was extracted and sequenced through shotgun sequencing. A novel multi-step bioinformatic pipeline was developed to find CAZymes and characterize the taxonomic and functional profiles of the microbial communities, using both reads and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) as input. The samples' microbiome was dominated by bacteria, where the classes Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Balneolia stood out for their higher abundance, indicating that the degradation of compost biomass is mainly driven by bacterial enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the functional studies revealed that our samples are a rich reservoir of glycoside hydrolases (GH), particularly of GH5 and GH9 cellulases, and GH3 oligosaccharide-degrading enzymes. We further constructed metagenomic fosmid libraries with the compost DNA and demonstrated that a great number of clones exhibited β-glucosidase activity. The comparison of our samples with others from the literature showed that, independently of the composition and process conditions, composting is an excellent source of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative study on the CAZyme abundance and taxonomic/functional profiles of Portuguese compost samples. KEY POINTS: • Sequence- and function-based metagenomics were used to find CAZymes in compost samples. • Thermophilic composts proved to be rich in bacterial GH3, GH5, and GH9 enzymes. • Compost-derived fosmid libraries are enriched in clones with β-glucosidase activity.

## Analysis of the microbiome of the Bolivian high-altitude Lake Pastos Grandes.
 04.07.2023, _J Daga-Quisbert, F Ugarte, GK Rajarao, AJA van Maris, J Quillaguamán_


Lake Pastos Grandes in Bolivia is mainly composed of salt flats, which are sporadically and only partially submerged during the wet season. In the present study, the chemical composition of water samples of the lake and some influent rivers was determined. We found that it is likely that the lake was influenced by the dilution of metals from ancient evaporites. We performed the first metagenomic studies on this lake. Analyses on shotgun metagenomics revealed that the relative abundances of Burkholderiales and Pseudomonadales were noteworthy in the water samples, whereas the archaea belonging to the Halobacteriales and Cyanobacteria from subsection III had high abundances in the salt flat. The eukaryotes Crustacea and Diatomea exhibited the highest abundances in the water samples. We investigated further the potential effect of human activities on the nitrogen cycle mobilization in the lake and the propagation of antimicrobial resistance genes. This is the first report about the cycle in the lake. Additionally, rifamycin resistance genes and genes related to efflux pumps, which are not considered a hazard when identified in metagenomes, had the uppermost relative abundances in all sampling points. We found that Lake Pastos Grandes hitherto does not show an appreciable influence by anthropogenic actions.

## Metagenomic Analysis of a Concrete Bridge Reveals a Microbial Community Dominated by Halophilic Bacteria and Archaea.
 05.07.2023, _EA Kiledal, M Shaw, SW Polson, JA Maresca_


Concrete hosts a small but diverse microbiome that changes over time. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing would enable assessment of both the diversity and function of the microbial community in concrete, but a number of unique challenges make this difficult for concrete samples. The high concentration of divalent cations in concrete interferes with nucleic acid extraction, and the extremely low biomass in concrete means that DNA from laboratory contamination may be a large fraction of the sequence data. Here, we develop an improved method for DNA extraction from concrete, with higher yield and lower laboratory contamination. To show that this method provides DNA of sufficient quality and quantity to do shotgun metagenomic sequencing, DNA was extracted from a sample of concrete obtained from a road bridge and sequenced with an Illumina MiSeq system. This microbial community was dominated by halophilic Bacteria and Archaea, with enriched functional pathways related to osmotic stress responses. Although this was a pilot-scale effort, we demonstrate that metagenomic sequencing can be used to characterize microbial communities in concrete and that older concrete structures may host different microbes than recently poured concrete. IMPORTANCE Prior work on the microbial communities of concrete focused on the surfaces of concrete structures such as sewage pipes or bridge pilings, where thick biofilms were easy to observe and sample. Because the biomass inside concrete is so low, more recent analyses of the microbial communities inside concrete used amplicon sequencing methods to describe those communities. However, to understand the activity and physiology of microbes in concrete, or to develop living infrastructure, we must develop more direct methods of community analysis. The method developed here for DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing can be used for analysis of microbial communities inside concrete and can likely be adapted for other cementitious materials.

_Humans, Bacteria, Mouth, Saliva, Microbiota, Streptococcus_
The oral cavity harbors highly diverse communities of microorganisms. However, the number of isolated species and high-quality genomes is limited. Here we present a Cultivated Oral Bacteria Genome Reference (COGR), comprising 1089 high-quality genomes based on large-scale aerobic and anaerobic cultivation of human oral bacteria isolated from dental plaques, tongue, and saliva. COGR covers five phyla and contains 195 species-level clusters of which 95 include 315 genomes representing species with no taxonomic annotation. The oral microbiota differs markedly between individuals, with 111 clusters being person-specific. Genes encoding CAZymes are abundant in the genomes of COGR. Members of the Streptococcus genus make up the largest proportion of COGR and many of these harbor entire pathways for quorum sensing important for biofilm formation. Several clusters containing unknown bacteria are enriched in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, emphasizing the importance of culture-based isolation for characterizing and exploiting oral bacteria.

## Gene-based microbiome representation enhances host phenotype classification.
 05.07.2023, _T Deschênes, FWE Tohoundjona, PL Plante, V Di Marzo, F Raymond_


With the concomitant advances in both the microbiome and machine learning fields, the gut microbiome has become of great interest for the potential discovery of biomarkers to be used in the classification of the host health status. Shotgun metagenomics data derived from the human microbiome is composed of a high-dimensional set of microbial features. The use of such complex data for the modeling of host-microbiome interactions remains a challenge as retaining de novo content yields a highly granular set of microbial features. In this study, we compared the prediction performances of machine learning approaches according to different types of data representations derived from shotgun metagenomics. These representations include commonly used taxonomic and functional profiles and the more granular gene cluster approach. For the five case-control datasets used in this study (Type 2 diabetes, obesity, liver cirrhosis, colorectal cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease), gene-based approaches, whether used alone or in combination with reference-based data types, allowed improved or similar classification performances as the taxonomic and functional profiles. In addition, we show that using subsets of gene families from specific functional categories of genes highlight the importance of these functions on the host phenotype. This study demonstrates that both reference-free microbiome representations and curated metagenomic annotations can provide relevant representations for machine learning based on metagenomic data. IMPORTANCE Data representation is an essential part of machine learning performance when using metagenomic data. In this work, we show that different microbiome representations provide varied host phenotype classification performance depending on the dataset. In classification tasks, untargeted microbiome gene content can provide similar or improved classification compared to taxonomical profiling. Feature selection based on biological function also improves classification performance for some pathologies. Function-based feature selection combined with interpretable machine learning algorithms can generate new hypotheses that can potentially be assayed mechanistically. This work thus proposes new approaches to represent microbiome data for machine learning that can potentiate the findings associated with metagenomic data.

'Omics methods have empowered scientists to tackle the complexity of microbial communities on a scale not attainable before. Individually, omics analyses can provide great insight; while combined as "meta-omics", they enhance the understanding of which organisms occupy specific metabolic niches, how they interact, and how they utilize environmental nutrients. Here we present three integrative meta-omics workflows, developed in Galaxy, for enhanced analysis and integration of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics, combined with our newly developed web-application, ViMO (Visualizer for Meta-Omics) to analyse metabolisms in complex microbial communities.

There are compelling reasons to test compositional hypotheses about microbiome data. We present here LDM-clr, an extension of our linear decomposition model (LDM) approach to allow fitting linear models to centered-log-ratio-transformed taxa count data. As LDM-clr is implemented within the existing LDM program, it enjoys all the features supported by LDM, including a compositional analysis of differential abundance at both the taxon and community levels, while allowing for a wide range of covariates and study designs for either association or mediation analysis.

## Processing and Storage Methods Affect Oral and Gut Microbiome Composition.
 04.07.2023, _DK Superdock, W Zhang, AC Poole_


Across microbiome studies, fecal and oral samples are stored and processed in different ways, which could affect the observed microbiome composition. Here, we compared treatment methods, which included both storage conditions and processing methods, applied to samples prior to DNA extraction to determine how each affects microbial community diversity as assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We collected dental swab, saliva, and fecal samples from 10 individuals, with three technical replicates per treatment method. We assessed four methods of processing fecal samples prior to DNA extraction. We also compared different fractions of frozen saliva and dental samples to fresh samples. We found that lyophilized fecal samples, fresh whole saliva samples, and the supernatant fraction of thawed dental samples retained the highest levels of alpha diversity in samples. The supernatant fraction of thawed saliva samples had the second highest alpha diversity compared to fresh. Then we investigated the differences in microbes between different treatments at the domain and phylum levels as well as identified the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) that were significantly different between the methods producing the highest alpha diversity and the other treatment methods. Lyophilized fecal samples had a greater prevalence of Archaea as well as a greater ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes compared to the other treatment methods. Our results provide practical considerations, not only for selection of processing method, but also for comparing results across studies that use these methods. Our findings also indicate differences in treatment method could be a confounding factor influencing the presence, absence, or differential abundance of microbes reported in conflicting studies.
