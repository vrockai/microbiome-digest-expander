Globally, stunting affects ∼150 million children under five, while wasting affects nearly 50 million. Current interventions have had limited effectiveness in ameliorating long-term sequelae of undernutrition including stunting, cognitive deficits and immune dysfunction. Disrupted development of the gut microbiota has been linked to the pathogenesis of undernutrition, providing potentially new treatment approaches.

## Candida albicans natural diversity: a resource to dissect fungal commensalism and pathogenesis.
 04.06.2024, _E Lindemann-Perez, JC Perez_


Candida albicans is a ubiquitous fungus of humans. It is not only a component of the oral and intestinal microbiota of most healthy adults but also a major cause of mucosal disorders and life-threatening disseminated infections. Until recently, research on the biology and pathogenesis of the fungus was largely based on a single clinical isolate. We review investigations that have started to dissect a diverse set of C. albicans strains. Using different approaches to leverage the species' phenotypic and/or genetic diversity, these studies illuminate the wide range of interactions between fungus and host. While connecting genetic variants to phenotypes of interest remains challenging, research on C. albicans' natural diversity is central to understand fungal commensalism and pathogenesis.

## Spatial recovery of the murine gut microbiota after antibiotics perturbation.
 04.06.2024, _M Taguer, J Xiao, R Crawford, H Shi, MP Cheng, M Citron, GD Hannigan, SH Kasper_


Bacterial communities are highly complex, with interaction networks dictating ecosystem function. Bacterial interactions are constrained by the spatial organization of these microbial communities, yet studying the spatial organization of microbial communities at the single-cell level has been technically challenging. Here, we use the recently developed high-phylogenetic-resolution microbiota mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization technology to image the gut microbiota at the species and single-cell level. We simultaneously image 63 different bacterial species to spatially characterize the perturbation and recovery of the gut microbiota to ampicillin and vancomycin in the cecum and distal colon of mice. To decipher the biology in this complex imaging data, we developed an analytical framework to characterize the spatial changes of the gut microbiota to a perturbation. The three-tiered analytical approach includes image-level diversity, pairwise colocalization analysis, and hypothesis-driven neighborhood analysis. Through this workflow, we identify biogeographic and antibiotic-based differences in the spatial organization of the gut microbiota. We demonstrate that the cecal microbiota has increased micrometer-scale diversity than the colon at baseline and recovers better from perturbation. Also, we identify potential foundation and keystone species that have high baseline neighborhood richness and that are associated with recovery from antibiotics. Through this workflow, we add a spatial layer to the characterization of bacterial communities and progress toward a better understanding of bacterial interactions leading to improved microbiome modulation strategies.

## Global biogeography of microbes driving ocean ecological status under climate change.

Microbial communities play a crucial role in ocean ecology and global biogeochemical processes. However, understanding the intricate interactions among diversity, taxonomical composition, functional traits, and how these factors respond to climate change remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose seven distinct ecological statuses by systematically considering the diversity, structure, and biogeochemical potential of the ocean microbiome to delineate their biogeography. Anthropogenic climate change is expected to alter the ecological status of the surface ocean by influencing environmental conditions, particularly nutrient and oxygen contents. Our predictive model, which utilizes machine learning, indicates that the ecological status of approximately 32.44% of the surface ocean may undergo changes from the present to the end of this century, assuming no policy interventions. These changes mainly include poleward shifts in the main taxa, increases in photosynthetic carbon fixation and decreases in nutrient metabolism. However, this proportion can decrease significantly with effective control of greenhouse gas emissions. Our study underscores the urgent necessity for implementing policies to mitigate climate change, particularly from an ecological perspective.

## Macroalgal eukaryotic microbiome composition indicates novel phylogenetic diversity and broad host spectrum of oomycete pathogens.

Seaweeds are important components of marine ecosystems with emerging potential in aquaculture and as sources of biofuel, food products and pharmacological compounds. However, an increasingly recognised threat to natural and industrial seaweed populations is infection with parasitic single-celled eukaryotes from the relatively understudied oomycete lineage. Here we examine the eukaryomes of diverse brown, red and green marine macroalgae collected from polar (Baffin Island), cold-temperate (Falkland Islands) and tropical (Ascension Island) locations, with a focus on oomycete and closely related diatom taxa. Using 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we show unexpected genetic and taxonomic diversity of the eukaryomes, a strong broad-brush association between eukaryome composition and geographic location, and some evidence of association between eukaryome structure and macroalgal phylogenetic relationships (phylosymbiosis). However, the oomycete fraction of the eukaryome showed disparate patterns of diversity and structure, highlighting much weaker association with geography and no evidence of phylosymbiosis. We present several novel haplotypes of the most common oomycete Eurychasma dicksonii and report for the first time a cosmopolitan distribution and absence of host specificity of this important pathogen. This indicates rich diversity in macroalgal oomycete pathogens and highlights that these pathogens may be generalist and highly adaptable to diverse environmental conditions.

We previously reported that asthma prevalence was higher in the United States (US) compared to Mexico (MX) (25.8% vs. 8.4%). This investigation assessed differences in microbial dust composition in relation to demographic and housing characteristics on both sides of the US-MX Border. Forty homes were recruited in the US and MX. Home visits collected floor dust and documented occupants' demographics, asthma prevalence, housing structure, and use characteristics. US households were more likely to have inhabitants who reported asthma when compared with MX households (30% vs. 5%) and had significantly different flooring types. The percentage of households on paved roads, with flushing toilets, with piped water and with air conditioning was higher in the US, while dust load was higher in MX. Significant differences exist between countries in the microbial composition of the floor dust. Dust from Mexican homes was enriched with Alishewanella, Paracoccus, Rheinheimera genera and Intrasporangiaceae family. A predictive metagenomics analysis identified 68 significantly differentially abundant functional pathways between US and MX. This study documented multiple structural, environmental, and demographic differences between homes in the US and MX that may contribute to significantly different microbial composition of dust observed in these two countries.

## Tibetan Plateau grasslands might increase sequestration of microbial necromass carbon under future warming.

_Tibet, Grassland, Soil Microbiology, Carbon Sequestration, Carbon, Global Warming, Soil, Climate Change_
Microbial necromass carbon (MNC) can reflect soil carbon (C) sequestration capacity. However, changes in the reserves of MNC in response to warming in alpine grasslands across the Tibetan Plateau are currently unclear. Based on large-scale sampling and published observations, we divided eco-clusters based on dominant phylotypes, calculated their relative abundance, and found that their averaged importance to MNC was higher than most other environmental variables. With a deep learning model based on stacked autoencoder, we proved that using eco-cluster relative abundance as the input variable of the model can accurately predict the overall distribution of MNC under current and warming conditions. It implied that warming could lead to an overall increase in the MNC in grassland topsoil across the Tibetan Plateau, with an average increase of 7.49 mg/g, a 68.3% increase. Collectively, this study concludes that alpine grassland has the tendency to increase soil C sequestration capacity on the Tibetan Plateau under future warming.
