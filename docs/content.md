## Microbiota-brain interactions: Moving toward mechanisms in model organisms.
 15.10.2021, _J Nagpal, JF Cryan_


Changes in the microbiota are associated with alterations in nervous system structure-function and behavior and have been implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Most of these studies have centered on mammalian models due to their phylogenetic proximity to humans. Indeed, the germ-free mouse has been a particularly useful model organism for investigating microbiota-brain interactions. However, microbiota-brain axis research on simpler genetic model organisms with a vast and diverse scientific toolkit (zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans) is now also coming of age. In this review, we summarize the current state of microbiota-brain axis research in rodents and humans, and then we elaborate and discuss recent research on the neurobiological and behavioral effects of the microbiota in the model systems of fish, flies, and worms. We propose that a cross-species, holistic and mechanistic approach to unravel the microbiota-brain communication is an essential step toward rational microbiota-based therapeutics to combat brain disorders.

## Functional attractors in microbial community assembly.

For microbiome biology to become a more predictive science, we must identify which descriptive features of microbial communities are reproducible and predictable, which are not, and why. We address this question by experimentally studying parallelism and convergence in microbial community assembly in replicate glucose-limited habitats. Here, we show that the previously observed family-level convergence in these habitats reflects a reproducible metabolic organization, where the ratio of the dominant metabolic groups can be explained from a simple resource-partitioning model. In turn, taxonomic divergence among replicate communities arises from multistability in population dynamics. Multistability can also lead to alternative functional states in closed ecosystems but not in metacommunities. Our findings empirically illustrate how the evolutionary conservation of quantitative metabolic traits, multistability, and the inherent stochasticity of population dynamics, may all conspire to generate the patterns of reproducibility and variability at different levels of organization that are commonplace in microbial community assembly.

## Bloodstream infections' origins following fecal microbiota transplantation: a strain-level analysis.
 13.10.2021, _A Eshel, I Sharon, A Nagler, D Bomze, I Danylesko, JA Fein, M Geva, I Henig, A Shimoni, T Zuckerman, I Youngster, O Koren, R Shouval_


We observed high rates of bloodstream infections (BSIs) following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for graft-versus-host-disease (33 events in 22 patients). To trace the BSIs' origin, we applied a metagenomic bioinformatic pipeline screening donor and recipient stool samples for bacteremia-causing strains in 13 cases. Offending strains were not detected in FMT donations. Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii could be detected in stool samples before emerging in the blood. In this largest report of BSIs post-FMT, we present an approach that may be applicable for evaluating BSI origin following microbiota-based interventions. Our findings support FMT safety in immunocompromised patients but do not rule out FMT as an inducer of bacterial translocation.
