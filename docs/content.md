Overweight and obesity are closely linked to gut dysbiosis/dysmetabolism and disrupted De-Ritis ratio [aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio], which may contribute to chronic noncommunicable diseases onset. Concurrently, extensive research explores nutraceuticals, and health-enhancing supplements, for disease prevention or treatment. Thus, sedentary overweight volunteers were double-blind randomized into two groups: Novel Nutraceutical_(S) (without silymarin) and Novel Nutraceutical (with silymarin). Experimental formulations were orally administered twice daily over 180 consecutive days. We evaluated fecal gut microbiota, based on partial 16S rRNA sequences, biochemistry and endocrine markers, steatosis biomarker (AST/ALT ratio), and anthropometric parameters. Post-supplementation, only the Novel Nutraceutical group reduced Clostridium clostridioforme (Firmicutes), Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio), and De-Ritis ratio, while elevating Bacteroides caccae and Bacteroides uniformis (Bacteroidetes) in Brazilian sedentary overweight volunteers after 180 days. In summary, the results presented here allow us to suggest the gut microbiota as the action mechanism of the Novel Nutraceutical promoting metabolic hepatic recovery in obesity/overweight non-drug interventions.

## Skin Deep: The Potential of Microbiome Cosmetics.
 16.04.2024, _JH Han, HS Kim_


The interplay between the skin microbiome and its host is a complex facet of dermatological health and has become a critical focus in the development of microbiome cosmetics. The skin microbiome, comprising various microorganisms, is essential from birth, develops over the lifespan, and performs vital roles in protecting our body against pathogens, training the immune system, and facilitating the breakdown of organic matter. Dysbiosis, an imbalance of these microorganisms, has been implicated in a number of skin conditions such as acne, atopic dermatitis, and skin cancer. Recent scientific findings have spurred cosmetic companies to develop products that preserve and enhance the skin's microbial diversity balance. These products may incorporate elements like prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics, which are beneficial for the skin microbiome. Beyond topical products, there's increasing interest in ingestible beauty supplements (i.e. oral probiotics), highlighting the connection between the gut and skin. This review examines the influence of the microbiome on skin health and the emerging trends of microbiome skincare products.

## Metabolic Interaction Between Host and the Gut Microbiota During High-Fat Diet-Induced Colorectal Cancer.
 16.04.2024, _C Lee, S Lee, W Yoo_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-highest cause of cancer-associated mortality among both men and women worldwide. One of the risk factors for CRC is obesity, which is correlated with a high-fat diet prevalent in Western dietary habits. The association between an obesogenic high-fat diet and CRC has been established for several decades; however, the mechanisms by which a high-fat diet increases the risk of CRC remain unclear. Recent studies indicate that gut microbiota strongly influence the pathogenesis of both high-fat diet-induced obesity and CRC. The gut microbiota is composed of hundreds of bacterial species, some of which are implicated in CRC. In particular, the expansion of facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae, which is considered a microbial signature of intestinal microbiota functional imbalance (dysbiosis), is associated with both high-fat diet-induced obesity and CRC. Here, we review the interaction between the gut microbiome and its metabolic byproducts in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC) during high-fat diet-induced obesity. In addition, we will cover how a high-fat diet can drive the expansion of genotoxin-producing Escherichia coli by altering intestinal epithelial cell metabolism during gut inflammation conditions.

A Hungarian survey of Tokaj-Mád vineyards was conducted. Shotgun metabarcoding was applied to decipher the microbial-terroir. The results of 60 soil samples showed that there were three dominant fungal phyla, Ascomycota 66.36% ± 15.26%, Basidiomycota 18.78% ± 14.90%, Mucoromycota 11.89% ± 8.99%, representing 97% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Mutual interactions between microbiota diversity and soil physicochemical parameters were revealed. Principal component analysis showed descriptive clustering patterns of microbial taxonomy and resistance gene profiles in the case of the four historic vineyards (Szent Tamás, Király, Betsek, Nyúlászó). Linear discriminant analysis effect size was performed, revealing pronounced shifts in community taxonomy based on soil physicochemical properties. Twelve clades exhibited the most significant shifts (LDA &gt; 4.0), including the phyla Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Rokubacteria, the classes Acidobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Betaproteobacteria, the order Sphingomonadales, Hypomicrobiales, as well as the family Sphingomonadaceae and the genus Sphingomonas. Three out of the four historic vineyards exhibited the highest occurrences of the bacterial genus Bradyrhizobium, known for its positive influence on plant development and physiology through the secretion of steroid phytohormones. During ripening, the taxonomical composition of the soil fungal microbiota clustered into distinct groups depending on altitude, differences that were not reflected in bacteriomes. Network analyses were performed to unravel changes in fungal interactiomes when comparing postveraison and preharvest samples. In addition to the arbuscular mycorrhiza Glomeraceae, the families Mycosphaerellacae and Rhyzopodaceae and the class Agaricomycetes were found to have important roles in maintaining soil microbial community resilience. Functional metagenomics showed that the soil Na content stimulated several of the microbiota-related agrobiogeochemical cycles, such as nitrogen and sulphur metabolism; steroid, bisphenol, toluene, dioxin and atrazine degradation and the synthesis of folate.

## An in-depth evaluation of metagenomic classifiers for soil microbiomes.
 31.03.2024, _NR Edwin, AH Fitzpatrick, F Brennan, F Abram, O O'Sullivan_


Recent endeavours in metagenomics, exemplified by projects such as the human microbiome project and TARA Oceans, have illuminated the complexities of microbial biomes. A robust bioinformatic pipeline and meticulous evaluation of their methodology have contributed to the success of these projects. The soil environment, however, with its unique challenges, requires a specialized methodological exploration to maximize microbial insights. A notable limitation in soil microbiome studies is the dearth of soil-specific reference databases available to classifiers that emulate the complexity of soil communities. There is also a lack of in-vitro mock communities derived from soil strains that can be assessed for taxonomic classification accuracy.

## Effects of removing in-feed antibiotics and zinc oxide on the taxonomy and functionality of the microbiota in post weaning pigs.
 19.04.2024, _JM Ortiz Sanjuán, H Argüello, R Cabrera-Rubio, F Crispie, PD Cotter, JJ Garrido, D Ekhlas, CM Burgess, EG Manzanilla_


Post weaning diarrhoea (PWD) causes piglet morbidity and mortality at weaning and is a major driver for antimicrobial use worldwide. New regulations in the EU limit the use of in-feed antibiotics (Ab) and therapeutic zinc oxide (ZnO) to prevent PWD. New approaches to control PWD are needed, and understanding the role of the microbiota in this context is key. In this study, shotgun metagenome sequencing was used to describe the taxonomic and functional evolution of the faecal microbiota of the piglet during the first two weeks post weaning within three experimental groups, Ab, ZnO and no medication, on commercial farms using antimicrobials regularly in the post weaning period.

An essential component of the coral reef animal diversity is the species hidden in crevices within the reef matrix, referred to as the cryptobiome. These organisms play an important role in nutrient cycling and provide an abundant food source for higher trophic levels, yet they have been largely overlooked. Here, we analyzed the distribution patterns of the mobile cryptobiome (&gt;2000 μm) along the latitudinal gradient of the Saudi Arabian coast of the Red Sea. Analysis was conducted based on 54 Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures. We retrieved a total of 5273 organisms, from which 2583 DNA sequences from the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase I were generated through sanger sequencing. We found that the cryptobiome community is variable over short geographical distances within the basin. Regression tree models identified sea surface temperature (SST), percentage cover of hard coral and turf algae as determinant for the number of operational taxonomic units present per Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS). Our results also show that the community structure of the cryptobiome is associated with the energy available (measured as photosynthetic active radiation), sea surface temperature, and nearby reef habitat characteristics (namely hard corals, turf and macroalgae). Given that temperature and reef benthic characteristics affect the cryptobiome, current scenarios of intensive climate change are likely to modify this fundamental biological component of coral reef functioning. However, the trajectory of change is unknow and can be site specific, as for example, diversity is expected to increase above SST of 28.5°C, and with decreasing hard coral and turf cover. This study provides a baseline of the cryptobenthic community prior to major coastal developments in the Red Sea to be used for future biodiversity studies and monitoring projects. It can also contribute to better understand patterns of reef biodiversity in a period where Marine Protected Areas are being discussed in the region.

## Randomized feature selection based semi-supervised latent Dirichlet allocation for microbiome analysis.
 19.04.2024, _N Pais, N Ravishanker, S Rajasekaran, G Weinstock, DB Tran_


_Humans, Algorithms, Microbiota, Gastrointestinal Microbiome_
Health and disease are fundamentally influenced by microbial communities and their genes (the microbiome). An in-depth analysis of microbiome structure that enables the classification of individuals based on their health can be crucial in enhancing diagnostics and treatment strategies to improve the overall well-being of an individual. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised methodology known as Randomized Feature Selection based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (RFSLDA) to study the impact of the gut microbiome on a subject's health status. Since the data in our study consists of fuzzy health labels, which are self-reported, traditional supervised learning approaches may not be suitable. As a first step, based on the similarity between documents in text analysis and gut-microbiome data, we employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling approach which uses microbiome counts as features to group subjects into relatively homogeneous clusters, without invoking any knowledge of observed health status (labels) of subjects. We then leverage information from the observed health status of subjects to associate these clusters with the most similar health status making it a semi-supervised approach. Finally, a feature selection technique is incorporated into the model to improve the overall classification performance. The proposed method provides a semi-supervised topic modelling approach that can help handle the high dimensionality of the microbiome data in association studies. Our experiments reveal that our semi-supervised classification algorithm is effective and efficient in terms of high classification accuracy compared to popular supervised learning approaches like SVM and multinomial logistic model. The RFSLDA framework is attractive because it (i) enhances clustering accuracy by identifying key bacteria types as indicators of health status, (ii) identifies key bacteria types within each group based on estimates of the proportion of bacteria types within the groups, and (iii) computes a measure of within-group similarity to identify highly similar subjects in terms of their health status.
