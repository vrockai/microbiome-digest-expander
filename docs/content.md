Persons living with HIV (PWH) harbor an altered gut microbiome (higher abundance of Prevotella and lower abundance of Bacillota and Ruminococcus lineages) compared to non-infected individuals. Some of these alterations are linked to sexual preference and others to the HIV infection. The relationship between these lineages and metabolic alterations, often present in aging PWH, has been poorly investigated.

## The human microbiome in space: parallels between Earth-based dysbiosis, implications for long-duration spaceflight, and possible mitigation strategies.
 13.08.2024, _S Etlin, J Rose, L Bielski, C Walter, AS Kleinman, CE Mason_


SUMMARYThe human microbiota encompasses the diverse communities of microorganisms that reside in, on, and around various parts of the human body, such as the skin, nasal passages, and gastrointestinal tract. Although research is ongoing, it is well established that the microbiota exert a substantial influence on the body through the production and modification of metabolites and small molecules. Disruptions in the composition of the microbiota-dysbiosis-have also been linked to various negative health outcomes. As humans embark upon longer-duration space missions, it is important to understand how the conditions of space travel impact the microbiota and, consequently, astronaut health. This article will first characterize the main taxa of the human gut microbiota and their associated metabolites, before discussing potential dysbiosis and negative health consequences. It will also detail the microbial changes observed in astronauts during spaceflight, focusing on gut microbiota composition and pathogenic virulence and survival. Analysis will then turn to how astronaut health may be protected from adverse microbial changes via diet, exercise, and antibiotics before concluding with a discussion of the microbiota of spacecraft and microbial culturing methods in space. The implications of this review are critical, particularly with NASA's ongoing implementation of the Moon to Mars Architecture, which will include weeks or months of living in space and new habitats.

The incidence of duodenal tumors (DTs) is increasing. However, the mechanisms underlying its development remain unclear. Environmental factors, including the microbiome and bile acids (BAs), are believed to influence tumor development. Therefore, we conducted a single-center, prospective, observational study to investigate the potential differences between patients with DTs and healthy controls (HCs) based on these factors. In addition, the BAs in the duodenal fluid were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We recruited 41 patients and performed 16S rRNA-seq. There was no difference in the observed ASVs or PCoA plot of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between the DTs and HCs. The lithocholic acid concentration was significantly lower in the DT group than in the control group. The ratio of CDCA to LCA was significantly higher in patients with DTs. No significant differences in microbiota were observed between DTs and HCs. In patients with DTs, the lithocholic acid concentration in duodenal was significantly lower than in HCs.

## Time-varying ambient air pollution exposure is associated with gut microbiome variation in the first 2 years of life.
 14.08.2024, _T Qiu, Q Fang, X Tian, Y Cao, X Fan, Y Li, Y Tu, L Liu, Z Chen, Y Wei, J Bai, J Huang, Y Liu_


The infant gut microbiome matures greatly in the first year of life. Ambient air pollution (AAP) exposure is associated with the infant gut microbiome. However, whether time-varying AAP influences infant gut microbiome variation is rarely investigated. This study aimed to investigate the effects of PM2.5, PM10, and O3 on infant gut microbiome variation longitudinally. Demographic information, stool samples, and AAP exposure concentrations were collected at 6, 12, 24 months from infants. Gut microbiome was processed and analyzed using 16S rRNA V3-V4 gene regions. AAP exposure concentrations were calculated using the China High Air Pollutants (CHAP) database. Multiple pollutant models were used to assess the mixed effects of PM2.5, PM10, and O3 on infant gut microbiome variation. Infants' gut microbiomes at 6, 12, 24 months old had significant differences in alpha diversity, beta diversity, and community composition. PM2.5 and O3 respectively explained 6.3% and 5.3% of the differences in community composition for 24-month-old infants. Single pollutant exposure and multiple pollutant exposure in different periods were both associated with alpha diversity indices and specific gut microbial phyla and genera. AAP was more associated with infant gut microbial alpha diversity indices, phyla variations, and genera variations at 12-24 months than 6-12 months. Multiple pollutant exposure in 0-2 lag months showed negative correlations with 12-24 months variation in Escherichia-Shigella (β = -0.854, 95%CI: 1.398 to -0.310) and Enterococcus (β = -0.979, 95%CI: 1.429 to -0.530). This study highlighted that time-varying PM2.5, PM10, and O3 synergistically influenced the variation of alpha diversity and abundance of gut microbial taxa in infants. Further research is needed to explore the effects and mechanisms of other environmental exposures on infant gut microbiome variation.

## Gut Microbiota-Induced Modulation of the Central Nervous System Function in Parkinson's Disease Through the Gut-Brain Axis and Short-Chain Fatty Acids.
 12.08.2024, _Y Ni, Q Tong, M Xu, J Gu, H Ye_


Recent insights into Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, suggest a significant influence of the gut microbiome on its pathogenesis and progression through the gut-brain axis. This study integrates 16S rRNA sequencing, high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing, and animal model experiments to explore the molecular mechanisms underpinning the role of gut-brain axis in PD, with a focus on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) mediated by the SCFA receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3. Our findings highlighted prominent differences in the gut microbiota composition between PD patients and healthy individuals, particularly in taxa such as Escherichia_Shigella and Bacteroidetes, which potentially impact SCFA levels through secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Notably, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models significantly improved motor function, enhanced dopamine and serotonin levels in the striatum, and increased the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra while reducing glial cell activation. This therapeutic effect was associated with increased levels of SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the gut of MPTP-lesioned mice. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulated expression of FFAR2 and FFAR3 in MPTP-lesioned mice, indicating their crucial role in mediating the benefits of FMT on the central nervous system. These results provide compelling evidence that gut microbiota and SCFAs play a critical role in modulating the gut-brain axis, offering new insights into PD's etiology and potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

_Bees, Animals, Pectins, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Symbiosis, Bifidobacterium, Polysaccharides, Hexuronic Acids_
The honeybee gut microbiome is crucial for degrading diverse pollen glycans. Yet it is unclear how this process shapes the interactions among bacteria. Here, we demonstrate a conditional mutualistic interaction between strains of two honeybee gut bacteria Bifidobacterium asteroides and Gilliamella apicola. When co-occurring in vitro and in vivo, Bifidobacterium provides complementary demethylation service to promote Gilliamella growth on methylated homogalacturonan, an enriched polysaccharide of pectin. In exchange, Gilliamella shares digestive products with Bifidobacterium, through which a positive interaction is established. This positive interaction vanishes when Bifidobacterium is not required on a non-methylated diet. Results from biochemical and gene expression analyses combined with model simulation further suggest that the ratio change of the two major homogalacturonan breakdown products, galacturonic acid (GalA) and di-GalA, determines the bacterial interaction. This study unravels how glycan metabolism may shape the interactions between honeybee gut bacteria.

## Environmentally acquired gut-associated bacteria are not critical for growth and survival in a solitary bee, Megachile rotundata.
 13.08.2024, _G Brar, M Floden, Q McFrederick, A Rajamohan, G Yocum, J Bowsher_


Social bees have been extensively studied for their gut microbial functions, but the significance of the gut microbiota in solitary bees remains less explored. Solitary bee, Megachile rotundata females provision their offspring with pollen from various plant species, harboring a diverse microbial community that colonizes larvae guts. The Apilactobacillus is the most abundant microbe, but evidence concerning the effects of Apilactobacillus and other provision microbes on growth and survival are lacking. We hypothesized that the presence of Apilactobacillus in abundance would enhance larval and prepupal development, weight, and survival, while the absence of intact microbial communities was expected to have a negative impact on bee fitness. We reared larvae on pollen provisions with naturally collected microbial communities (Natural pollen) or devoid of microbial communities (Sterile pollen). We also assessed the impact of introducing Apilactobacillus micheneri by adding it to both types of pollen provisions. Feeding larvae with sterile pollen + A. micheneri led to the highest mortality rate, followed by natural pollen + A. micheneri, and sterile pollen. Larval development was significantly delayed in groups fed with sterile pollen. Interestingly, larval and prepupal weights did not significantly differ across treatments compared to natural pollen-fed larvae. 16S rRNA gene sequencing found a dominance of Sodalis, when A. micheneri was introduced to natural pollen. The presence of Sodalis with abundant A. micheneri suggests potential crosstalk between both, shaping bee nutrition and health. Hence, this study highlights that the reliance on nonhost-specific environmental bacteria may not impact fitness of M. rotundata.IMPORTANCEThis study investigates the impact of environmentally acquired gut microbes of solitary bee fitness with insights into the microbial ecology of bee and their health. While the symbiotic microbiome is well-studied in social bees, the role of environmental acquired microbiota in solitary bees remains unclear. Assessing this relationship in a solitary pollinator, the leaf-cutting bee, Megachile rotundata, we discovered that this bee species does not depend on the diverse environmental bacteria found in pollen for either its larval growth or survival. Surprisingly, high concentrations of the most abundant pollen bacteria, Apilactobacillus micheneri did not consistently benefit bee fitness, but caused larval mortality. Our findings also suggest an interaction between Apilactobacillus and the Sodalis and perhaps their role in bee nutrition. Hence, this study provides significant insights that contribute to understanding the fitness, conservation, and pollination ecology of other solitary bee species in the future.

## Duck gut metagenome reveals the microbiome signatures linked to intestinal regional, temporal development, and rearing condition.
 14.08.2024, _L Ma, W Lyu, T Zeng, W Wang, Q Chen, J Zhao, G Zhang, L Lu, H Yang, Y Xiao_


The duck gastrointestinal tract (GIT) harbors an abundance of microorganisms that play an important role in duck health and production. Here, we constructed the first relatively comprehensive duck gut microbial gene catalog (24 million genes) and 4437 metagenome-assembled genomes using 375 GIT metagenomic samples from four different duck breeds across five intestinal segments under two distinct rearing conditions. We further characterized the intestinal region-specific microbial taxonomy and their assigned functions, as well as the temporal development and maturation of the duck gut microbiome. Our metagenomic analysis revealed the similarity within the microbiota of the foregut and hindgut compartments, but distinctive taxonomic and functional differences between distinct intestinal segments. In addition, we found a significant shift in the microbiota composition of newly hatched ducks (3 days), followed by increased diversity and enhanced stability across growth stages (14, 42, and 70 days), indicating that the intestinal microbiota develops into a relatively mature and stable community as the host duck matures. Comparing the impact of different rearing conditions (with and without water) on duck cecal microbiota communities and functions, we found that the bacterial capacity for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was significantly increased in ducks that had free access to water, leading to the accumulation of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic-resistance genes. Taken together, our findings expand the understanding of the microbiome signatures linked to intestinal regional, temporal development, and rearing conditions in ducks, which highlight the significant impact of microbiota on poultry health and production.

Microbial colonization during early life has a pivotal impact on the host health, shaping immune and metabolic functions, but little is known about timing and features of this process in dogs. The objectives of this study were to characterize the first step of intestinal microbiota development in naturally delivered canine puppies and to investigate its relationship with the maternal bacterial flora, using traditional culture and molecular analyses. Sixty puppies of two breeds, Appenzeller Cattle Dog (n = 3 dams) and Lagotto Romagnolo (n = 6), housed in the same breeding kennel, were included in the study. Swabs were collected in duplicate (for culture and for molecular analysis) from the dams' vagina and rectum at the end of parturition, from puppies' rectum, before maternal care, and from the environment (floor of the nursery and parturition box).

Tylosin, an antibiotic with a long history in treating respiratory bacterial infections, has unknown effects on the gut microbiota of healthy and infected pigs. The study aimed to investigate the effect of a therapeutic dose of tylosin on swine gut microbiota and explored the relationship between this effect and tylosin pharmacokinetics (PK). We also assessed whether changes in gut microbiota after tylosin administration differ between healthy animals (n = 7) and animals intranasally co-infected (n = 7) with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida. Both groups were intramuscularly administered with tylosin (20 mg/kg). The 16S rRNA gene analyses revealed a significantly lower species richness and diversity, after tylosin treatment, in the infected than the healthy pigs, with infected pigs having lower levels of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and higher levels of Proteobacteria. Greater tylosin exposure (greater area under curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and slower elimination (longer terminal half-life, T1/2) were observed in healthy than infected pigs. Relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Oscillibacter, Prevotella, and Sporobacter was positively and significantly correlated with AUC and Cmax, whereas the abundance of Acinetobacter, Alishewanella, and Pseudomonas was positively and significantly correlated with T1/2 and mean residence time (MRT) of tylosin. Our findings, for the first time, demonstrated significant changes in swine gut microbiota after a single therapeutic dose of tylosin was administered, whereas the effect of these changes on tylosin PK was not evident.

## Restriction of growth and biofilm formation of ESKAPE pathogens by caprine gut-derived probiotic bacteria.
 14.08.2024, _P Saini, R Ayyanna, R Kumar, SK Bhowmick, V Bhaskar, B Dey_


The accelerated rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant global health risk, necessitating the exploration of alternative strategies to combat pathogenic infections. Biofilm-related infections that are unresponsive to standard antibiotics often require the use of higher-order antimicrobials with toxic side effects and the potential to disrupt the microbiome. Probiotic therapy, with its diverse benefits and inherent safety, is emerging as a promising approach to prevent and treat various infections, and as an alternative to antibiotic therapy. In this study, we isolated novel probiotic bacteria from the gut of domestic goats (Capra hircus) and evaluated their antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities against the 'ESKAPE' group of pathogens. We performed comprehensive microbiological, biochemical, and molecular characterizations, including analysis of the 16S-rRNA gene V1-V3 region and the 16S-23S ISR region, on 20 caprine gut-derived lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Among these, six selected Lactobacillus isolates demonstrated substantial biofilm formation under anaerobic conditions and exhibited robust cell surface hydrophobicity and autoaggregation, and epithelial cell adhesion properties highlighting their superior enteric colonization capability. Notably, these Lactobacillus isolates exhibited broad-spectrum growth inhibitory and anti-biofilm properties against 'ESKAPE' pathogens. Additionally, the Lactobacillus isolates were susceptible to antibiotics listed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) within the prescribed Minimum Inhibitory Concentration limits, suggesting their safety as feed additives. The remarkable probiotic characteristics exhibited by the caprine gut-derived Lactobacillus isolates in this study strongly endorse their potential as compelling alternatives to antibiotics and direct-fed microbial (DFM) feed supplements in the livestock industry, addressing the escalating need for antibiotic-free animal products.

## Polyphenols improve non-alcoholic fatty liver disease via gut microbiota: A comprehensive review.
 14.08.2024, _K Mohammadhasani, M Vahedi Fard, A Mottaghi Moghaddam Shahri, Z Khorasanchi_


Polyphenols, natural micronutrients derived from plants, are valued for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The escalating global prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) underscores its status as a chronic progressive liver condition. Furthermore, the dysregulation of gut microbiota (GM) is implicated in the onset and progression of NAFLD through the actions of metabolites such as bile acids (BAs), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), choline, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Additionally, GM may influence the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This review aims to evaluate the potential effects of polyphenols on GM and intestinal barrier function, and their subsequent impact on NAFLD. We searched through a wide range of databases, such as Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus to gather information for our non-systematic review of English literature. GM functions and composition can be regulated by polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid, curcumin, green tea catechins, naringenin, quercetin, resveratrol, and sulforaphane. Regulating GM composition improves NAFLD by alleviating inflammation, liver fat accumulation, and liver enzymes. Furthermore, it improves serum lipid profile and gut barrier integrity. All of these components affect NAFLD through the metabolites of GM, including SCFAs, choline, LPS, and BAs. Current evidence indicates that chlorogenic acid, resveratrol, quercetin, and curcumin can modulate GM, improving intestinal barrier integrity and positively impacting NAFLD. More studies are necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of naringenin, sulforaphane, and catechin.

## Exploring the Potential of Postbiotics for Food Safety and Human Health Improvement.
 14.08.2024, _FJ Isaac-Bamgboye, CL Mgbechidinma, H Onyeaka, IT Isaac-Bamgboye, DC Chukwugozie_


Food safety is a global concern, with millions suffering from foodborne diseases annually. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports significant morbidity and mortality associated with contaminated food consumption, and this emphasizes the critical need for comprehensive food safety measures. Recent attention has turned to postbiotics, metabolic byproducts of probiotics, as potential agents for enhancing food safety. Postbiotics, including organic acids, enzymes, and bacteriocins, exhibit antimicrobial and antioxidant properties that do not require live organisms, and this offers advantages over probiotics. This literature review critically examines the role of postbiotics in gut microbiome modulation and applications in the food industry. Through an extensive review of existing literature, this study evaluates the impact of postbiotics on gut microbiome composition and their potential as functional food ingredients. Research indicates that postbiotics are effective in inhibiting food pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, and Escherichia coli, as well as their ability to prevent oxidative stress-related diseases, and they also show promise as alternatives to conventional food preservatives that can extend food shelf life by inhibiting harmful bacterial growth. Their application in functional foods contributes to improved gut health and reduced risk of foodborne illnesses. Findings suggest that postbiotics hold promise for improving health and preservation by inhibiting pathogenic bacteria growth and modulating immune responses.

To reduce the use of antibiotics and chemicals in aquaculture, an edible herb, Bidens pilosa, has been selected as a multifunctional feed additive. Although there has been considerable research into the effects of B. pilosa on poultry, the wider effects of B. pilosa, particularly on the growth and gut microbiota of fish, remain largely unexplored. We aimed to investigate the interactive effects between the host on growth and the gut microbiota using transcriptomics and the gut microbiota in B. pilosa-fed tilapia. In this study, we added 0.5% and 1% B. pilosa to the diet and observed that the growth performance of tilapia significantly increased over 8 weeks of feeding. Comparative transcriptome analysis was performed on RNA sequence profiles obtained from liver and muscle tissues. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that B. pilosa regulates several pathways and genes involved in amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, endocrine system, signal transduction, and metabolism of other amino acids. The expression of the selected growth-associated genes was validated by qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR results indicated that B. pilosa may enhance growth performance by activating the expression of the liver igf1 and muscle igf1rb genes and inhibiting the expression of the muscle negative regulator mstnb. Both the enhancement of liver endocrine IGF1/IGF1Rb signaling and the suppression of muscle autocrine/paracrine MSTN signaling induced the expression of myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), myod1, myog and mrf4 in muscle to promote muscle growth in tilapia. The predicted function of the gut microbiota showed several significantly different pathways that overlapped with the KEGG enrichment results of differentially expressed genes in the liver transcriptomes. This finding suggested that the gut microbiota may influence liver metabolism through the gut-liver axis in B. pilosa-fed tilapia. In conclusion, dietary B. pilosa can regulate endocrine IGF1 signaling and autocrine/paracrine MSTN signaling to activate the expression of MRFs to promote muscle growth and alter the composition of gut bacteria, which can then affect liver amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, endocrine system, lipid metabolism, metabolism of other amino acids, and signal transduction in the host, ultimately enhancing growth performance. Our results suggest that B. pilosa has the potential to be a functional additive that can be used as an alternative to reduce antibiotic use as a growth promoter in aquaculture.

## A comprehensive review of the characterization, host interactions, and stabilization advancements on probiotics: Addressing the challenges in functional food diversification.
 13.08.2024, _EG Fentie, K Lim, M Jeong, JH Shin_


_Probiotics, Humans, Animals, Functional Food, Gastrointestinal Microbiome_
The demand for functional food is rising in tandem with the prevalence of chronic diseases. Probiotics play a crucial role in functional food development, yet their ability to confer health benefits to the host remains a topic of debate according to Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization requirements. The application of culturomics, innovative isolation techniques, within the realm of probiotics is increasingly deemed essential for fully harnessing the latent potential of microbial reservoirs. Nevertheless, its application remains confined predominantly to human fecal sources. Following the integration of probiogenomics, significant advancements have been made in the safety assessment of probiotics. However, the adoption of novel probiotic microorganisms has yet to match the requisite pace. Progress in research concerning host-probiotic interactions by employing omics technologies, particularly in animal models, is notable. Nonetheless, the comprehensive elucidation of mechanisms of action and human trial studies are lagging behind. Additionally, the viability of probiotics, spanning from their production as functional foods to their transit to the human colon, has markedly improved through encapsulation techniques. Nevertheless, opportunities for exploration persist regarding alternative coating materials and diverse encapsulation methodologies. Furthermore, there is a discernible transition in the domain of probiotic-based functional foods, shifting away from a primarily dairy-centric focus toward inclusion in a broader array of food categories. This comprehensive review addresses critical issues ranging from isolation sources and novel techniques to the final functional food developments. while doing so, it explores probiogenomics applications for probiotic characterization, investigations into host-probiotic interactions, and strategies for probiotic stabilization under harsh environmental conditions.

 14.08.2024, _ME Çıtar Dazıroğlu, N Acar Tek, MF Cevher Akdulum, C Yılmaz, AM Yalınay_


Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which is common among women of reproductive age, is characterized by low-grade chronic inflammation and is associated with several health problems and dysbiosis. Kefir has been shown to have many beneficial health effects; however, its effect on PCOS is unknown. This study aimed to examine the effect of kefir on the intestinal microbiota and health outcomes in PCOS. In this intervention study, 17 women with PCOS consumed 250 mL/day of kefir (containing Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefiranofaciens, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefirgranum, Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus parakefiri, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesentereoides, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Kluyveromyces lactis, Acetobacter pasteurianus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for 8 weeks. Food consumption and physical activity records, anthropometrical measurements, quality of life, and fecal and blood samples were taken at the study's beginning and end. Quality of life in mental health (58.8 ± 15.08; 64.0 ± 15.23, respectively) and physical function (95.00 and 100.00, respectively) categories showed a significant increase after kefir intervention (p &lt; .05). Additionally, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), one of the inflammatory cytokines, significantly decreased (174.00 and 109.10 ng/L, respectively) (p &lt; .05). The intestinal barrier permeability was evaluated with zonulin, and no significant change was observed. Gut microbiota analysis showed that while the relative abundance of the class Bacilli and genus Lactococcus significantly increased, the genus Holdemania decreased with kefir consumption (p &lt; .05). In conclusion, kefir appears to be beneficial for improving the microbiota and some health outcomes, like reducing inflammation and improving quality of life in PCOS. Therefore, kefir may be useful in the treatment of PCOS.

Manipulating the rhizosphere microbiome to enhance plant stress tolerance is an environmentally friendly technology and a renewable resource to restore degraded environments. Here we suggest a sustainable bioremediation strategy on the example of Stebnyk mine tailings storage. We consider Salicornia europaea rhizosphere community, and the ability of the phytoremediation plant Salix viminalis to recruit its beneficial microbiome to mediate the pollution stress at the Stebnyk mine tailings storage. The tailings contain large amounts of brine salts and heavy metals that contaminate the ground water and surrounding areas, changing soil biogeochemistry and causing increased erosion. The species richness of the endophytic bacterial community of S. viminalis roots was assessed based on observed OTUs, Shannon-InvSimpson, and evenness index. Our results obtained using the plant-based enrichment strategy show that biodiversity was decreased across the contamination zones and that S. europaea supplementation significantly increased the species richness. Our results also indicate that the number of dominating bacteria was not changed across zones in both S. europaea-treated and untreated bacterial populations, and that the decrease in richness was mainly caused by the low abundant bacterial OTUs. The importance of selecting the bioremediation strains that are likely to harbor a reservoir of genetic traits that aid in bioremediation function from the target environment is discussed.

The presence of bacteria from the Dickeya spp. and Pectobacterium spp. in farmlands leads to global crop losses of over $420 million annually. Since 1982, the scientists have started to suspect that the development of disease symptoms in crops might be inhibited by bacteria present in the soil. Here, we characterized in terms of physicochemical properties and the composition of bacterial soil microbiota two fields differing, on the basis of long-term studies, in the occurrence of Dickeya spp.- and Pectobacterium spp.-triggered infections. Majority, i.e. 17 of the investigated physicochemical features of the soils collected from two fields of either low or high potato blackleg and soft rot diseases incidences turned out to be similar, in contrast to the observed 4 deviations in relation to Mg, Mn, organic C and organic substance contents. By performing microbial cultures and molecular diagnostics-based identification, 20 Pectobacterium spp. strains were acquired from the field showing high blackleg and soft rot incidences. In addition, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing followed by bioinformatic analysis revealed differences at various taxonomic levels in the soil bacterial microbiota of the studied fields. We observed that bacteria from the genera Bacillus, Rumeliibacillus, Acidobacterium and Gaiella turned out to be more abundant in the soil samples originating from the field of low comparing to high frequency of pectinolytic bacterial infections. In the herein presented case study, it is shown for the first time that the composition of bacterial soil microbiota varies between two fields differing in the incidences of soft rot and blackleg infections.

Compost-bedded pack barns (CBP) are getting huge attention as an alternative housing system for dairy cows due to their beneficial impact on animal welfare. Effective microorganisms (EM) inoculums are believed to enhance compost quality, improve soil structure and benefit the environment. However, little information is available on the impact of incubation with external EM combinations on the barn environment, compost quality and microbial diversity in CBP. This experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of inoculating different combinations of EM [Lactobacillus plantarum (L), Compound Bacillus (B) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S)] on compost quality and microbial communities of CBP products, as well as the relationship with the heifers' barn environment. CBP barns were subjected to the following four treatments: CON with no EM inoculum, LB/LS/LBS were Incubated with weight ratios of 1:2 (L: B), 1:2 (L: S), 1:1:1 (L: B: S), respectively.

Despite the growing catalogue of studies detailing the taxonomic and functional composition of soil bacterial communities, the life history traits of those communities remain largely unknown. This study analyzes a global dataset of soil metagenomes to explore environmental drivers of growth potential, a fundamental aspect of bacterial life history. We find that growth potential, estimated from codon usage statistics, was highest in forested biomes and lowest in arid latitudes. This indicates that bacterial productivity generally reflects ecosystem productivity globally. Accordingly, the strongest environmental predictors of growth potential were productivity indicators, such as distance to the equator, and soil properties that vary along productivity gradients, such as pH and carbon to nitrogen ratios. We also observe that growth potential was negatively correlated with the relative abundances of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, demonstrating tradeoffs between growth and resource acquisition in soil bacteria. Overall, we identify macroecological patterns in bacterial growth potential and link growth rates to soil carbon cycling.

## Microplastic-contamination can reshape plant community by affecting soil properties.
 11.08.2024, _M He, W Yao, Z Meng, J Liu, W Yan, W Meng_


Microplastics, as emerging contaminants, pose a serious threat to terrestrial ecosystems, yet their impact on plant communities remains largely unexplored. This study utilized the soil seed bank to establish naturally germinated plant communities and investigated the effects of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) on community characteristics. Additionally, the study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which variations in soil properties influenced plant community. The results indicated that microplastics led to a significant increase in soil available potassium (AK), likely due to alterations in soil microorganism proliferation. Furthermore, microplastics caused a decrease in soil salinity, total phosphorus (TP), and ammonium nitrogen (AN). Additionally, plant community composition shifted, resulting in reduced stability and niche breadth of dominant species. Microplastics also impacted niche overlap and interspecific associations among dominant species, possibly due to the reduced accessibility of resources for dominant species. Salinity, AK, and TP were identified as major drivers of changes in niche breadth, niche overlap, and community stability, with TP exerting the strongest impact on plant community composition. These findings provide valuable insights for the restoration of plant communities in coastal saline-alkali wetland contaminated by microplastics.

_Microplastics, Wastewater, Biofilms, Microbiota, Sewage, Waste Disposal, Fluid, Water Pollutants, Chemical, Bacteria, Plastics_
Despite some effectiveness of wastewater treatment processes, microplastics accumulate in sewage sludge and their further use may contribute to the release of plastic microplastics into the environment. There is an urgent need to reduce the amount of microplastics in sewage sludge. Plastic particles serve as solid substrates for various microorganisms, promoting the formation of microbial biofilms with different metabolic activities. The biofilm environment associated with microplastics will determine the efficiency of treatment processes, especially biological methods, and the mechanisms of organic compound conversion. A significant source of microplastics is the land application of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants. The detrimental impact of microplastics affects soil enzymatic activity, soil microorganisms, flora, fauna, and plant production. This review article summarizes the development of research related to microplastics and discusses the issue of microplastic introduction from sewage sludge. Given that microplastics can contain complex composite polymers and form a plastisphere, further research is needed to understand their potential environmental impact, pathogenicity, and the characteristics of biofilms in wastewater treatment systems. The article also discusses the physicochemical properties of microplastics in wastewater treatment plants and their role in biofilm formation. Then, the article explained the impact of these properties on the possibility of the formation of biofilms on their surface due to the peculiar structure of microorganisms and also characterized what factors enable the formation of specific plastisphere in wastewater treatment plants. It highlights the urgent need to understand the basic information about microplastics to assess environmental toxicity more rationally, enabling better pollution control and the development of regulatory standards to manage microplastics entering the environment.

## Higher-order interactions and emergent properties of microbial communities: The power of synthetic ecology.
 13.08.2024, _O Gallardo-Navarro, B Aguilar-Salinas, J Rocha, G Olmedo-Álvarez_


Humans have long relied on microbial communities to create products, produce energy, and treat waste. The microbiota residing within our bodies directly impacts our health, while the soil and rhizosphere microbiomes influence the productivity of our crops. However, the complexity and diversity of microbial communities make them challenging to study and difficult to develop into applications, as they often exhibit the emergence of unpredictable higher-order phenomena. Synthetic ecology aims at simplifying complexity by constituting synthetic or semi-natural microbial communities with reduced diversity that become easier to study and analyze. This strategy combines methodologies that simplify existing complex systems (top-down approach) or build the system from its constituent components (bottom-up approach). Simplified communities are studied to understand how interactions among populations shape the behavior of the community and to model and predict their response to external stimuli. By harnessing the potential of synthetic microbial communities through a multidisciplinary approach, we can advance knowledge of ecological concepts and address critical public health, agricultural, and environmental issues more effectively.

## Antibiotic resistance gene dynamics in the commensal infant gut microbiome over the first year of life.

Colonization of the infant gut is an important developmental process characterized by high carriage of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and high abundances of pathobionts. The horizontal transfer of ARGs to pathogenic bacteria represents a major public health concern. However, there is still a paucity of longitudinal studies surveilling ARGs in healthy infant guts at high temporal resolution. Furthermore, we do not yet have a clear view of how temporal variation in ARG carriage relates to the dynamics of specific bacterial populations, as well as community virulence potential. Here, we performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing of monthly fecal samples from a cohort of 12 infants, covering the first year of life to interrogate the infant gut microbiome for ARG content. We further relate ARG dynamics to the dynamics of taxa, virulence potential, as well as the potential for ARG mobilization. We identify a core resistome dominated by efflux systems typically associated with Enterobacteriaceae. Overall ARG carriage declined over the first year of life and showed strong contemporaneous correlation with the population dynamics of Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the majority of ARGs could be further mapped to metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) classified to this phylum. We were able to assign a large number of ARGs to E. coli by correlating the temporal dynamics of individual genes with species dynamics, and we show that the temporal dynamics of ARGs and virulence factors are highly correlated, suggesting close taxonomic associations between these two gene classes. Finally, we identify ARGs linked with various categories of mobile genetic elements, demonstrating preferential linkage among mobility categories and resistance to different drug classes. While individual variation in ARG carriage is substantial during infancy there is a clear reduction over the first year of life. With few exceptions, ARG abundances closely track the dynamics of pathobionts and community virulence potential. These findings emphasize the potential for development of resistant pathogens in the developing infant gut, and the importance of effective surveillance in order to detect such events.

## MetaBakery: a Singularity implementation of bioBakery tools as a skeleton application for efficient HPC deconvolution of microbiome metagenomic sequencing data to machine learning ready information.
 14.08.2024, _B Murovec, L Deutsch, D Osredkar, B Stres_


In this study, we present MetaBakery (http://metabakery.fe.uni-lj.si), an integrated application designed as a framework for synergistically executing the bioBakery workflow and associated utilities. MetaBakery streamlines the processing of any number of paired or unpaired fastq files, or a mixture of both, with optional compression (gzip, zip, bzip2, xz, or mixed) within a single run. MetaBakery uses programs such as KneadData (https://github.com/bioBakery/kneaddata), MetaPhlAn, HUMAnN and StrainPhlAn as well as integrated utilities and extends the original functionality of bioBakery. In particular, it includes MelonnPan for the prediction of metabolites and Mothur for calculation of microbial alpha diversity. Written in Python 3 and C++ the whole pipeline was encapsulated as Singularity container for efficient execution on various computing infrastructures, including large High-Performance Computing clusters. MetaBakery facilitates crash recovery, efficient re-execution upon parameter changes, and processing of large data sets through subset handling and is offered in three editions with bioBakery ingredients versions 4, 3 and 2 as versatile, transparent and well documented within the MetaBakery Users' Manual (http://metabakery.fe.uni-lj.si/metabakery_manual.pdf). It provides automatic handling of command line parameters, file formats and comprehensive hierarchical storage of output to simplify navigation and debugging. MetaBakery filters out potential human contamination and excludes samples with low read counts. It calculates estimates of alpha diversity and represents a comprehensive and augmented re-implementation of the bioBakery workflow. The robustness and flexibility of the system enables efficient exploration of changing parameters and input datasets, increasing its utility for microbiome analysis. Furthermore, we have shown that the MetaBakery tool can be used in modern biostatistical and machine learning approaches including large-scale microbiome studies.
