We are pleased to respond to the commentary by Dr. Chao Cheng and colleagues on our recent publication entitled "Role of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) in the Association between Osteoarthritis and Cardiovascular Diseases: A Longitudinal Study" that was published in Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology in November 2019 (1). The commentary raises important issues about further exploring the characteristics of our study population (the elderly) in whom it is well known that both the chronic conditions of OA and CVD are more prevalent.

## GATA3 induces the upregulation of UCP-1 by directly binding to PGC-1α during adipose tissue browning.
 30.05.2020, _MJ Son, KJ Oh, A Park, MG Kwon, JM Suh, IC Kim, S Kim, SC Lee, WK Kim, KH Bae_


Obesity is recognized as the cause of multiple metabolic diseases and is rapidly increasing worldwide. As obesity is due to an imbalance in energy homeostasis, the promotion of energy consumption through browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to counter the obesity epidemic. However, the molecular mechanisms of the browning process are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of the GATA family of transcription factors on the browning process.

## Current challenges and future opportunities of phage therapy.
 30.05.2020, _DP Pires, AR Costa, G Pinto, L Meneses, J Azeredo_


Antibiotic resistance is a major public health challenge worldwide, whose implications for global health might be devastating if novel antibacterial strategies are not quickly developed. As natural predators of bacteria, (bacterio)phages may play an essential role in escaping such a dreadful future. The rising problem of antibiotic resistance has revived the interest in phage therapy and important developments have been achieved over the last years. But where do we stand today and what can we expect from phage therapy in the future? This is the question we set to answer in this review. Here, we scour the outcomes of human phage therapy clinical trials and case reports and address the major barriers that stand in the way of using phages in clinical settings. We particularly address the potential of phage resistance to hinder phage therapy and discuss future avenues to explore the full capacity of phage therapy.

## The Weight Optimization Revamping Lifestyle using the Dietary Guidelines (WORLD) Study: Sustained Weight Loss Over 12 Months.
 31.05.2020, _TL Psota, AM Tindall, B Lohse, PE Miller, KS Petersen, PM Kris-Etherton_


This study aimed to compare two energy-restricted, nutrient-dense diets at the upper or lower ends of the dietary fat recommendation range (lower fat [20% energy from fat] versus moderate fat [35%]) on weight loss using behavioral theory-based nutrition education.

## Structural insight into the electron transfer pathway of a self-sufficient P450 monooxygenase.
 01.06.2020, _L Zhang, Z Xie, Z Liu, S Zhou, L Ma, W Liu, JW Huang, TP Ko, X Li, Y Hu, J Min, X Yu, RT Guo, CC Chen_


Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are versatile heme-thiolate enzymes that catalyze a wide range of reactions. Self-sufficient cytochrome P450 enzymes contain the redox partners in a single polypeptide chain. Here, we present the crystal structure of full-length CYP116B46, a self-sufficient P450. The continuous polypeptide chain comprises three functional domains, which align well with the direction of electrons traveling from FMN to the heme through the [2Fe-2S] cluster. FMN and the [2Fe-2S] cluster are positioned closely, which facilitates efficient electron shuttling. The edge-to-edge straight-line distance between the [2Fe-2S] cluster and heme is approx. 25.3 Å. The role of several residues located between the [2Fe-2S] cluster and heme in the catalytic reaction is probed in mutagenesis experiments. These findings not only provide insights into the intramolecular electron transfer of self-sufficient P450s, but are also of interest for biotechnological applications of self-sufficient P450s.
