_Humans, Peri-Implantitis, Microbiota_
We performed a longitudinal shotgun metagenomic investigation of the plaque microbiome associated with peri-implant diseases in a cohort of 91 subjects with 320 quality-controlled metagenomes. Through recently improved taxonomic profiling methods, we identified the most discriminative species between healthy and diseased subjects at baseline, evaluated their change over time, and provided evidence that clinical treatment had a positive effect on plaque microbiome composition in patients affected by mucositis and peri-implantitis.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) describes the transmission of DNA outside of direct ancestral lineages. The process is best characterised within the bacterial kingdom and can enable the acquisition of genetic traits that support bacterial adaptation to novel niches. The adaptation of bacteria to novel niches has particular relevance for faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a therapeutic procedure which aims to resolve gut-related health conditions of individuals, through transplanted gut microbiota from healthy donors.

## Psychological stress-induced microbial metabolite indole-3-acetate disrupts intestinal cell lineage commitment.
 24.01.2024, _W Wei, Y Liu, Y Hou, S Cao, Z Chen, Y Zhang, X Cai, Q Yan, Z Li, Y Yuan, G Wang, X Zheng, H Hao_


The brain and gut are intricately connected and respond to various stimuli. Stress-induced brain-gut communication is implicated in the pathogenesis and relapse of gut disorders. The mechanism that relays psychological stress to the intestinal epithelium, resulting in maladaptation, remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a stress-responsive brain-to-gut metabolic axis that impairs intestinal stem cell (ISC) lineage commitment. Psychological stress-triggered sympathetic output enriches gut commensal Lactobacillus murinus, increasing the production of indole-3-acetate (IAA), which contributes to a transferrable loss of intestinal secretory cells. Bacterial IAA disrupts ISC mitochondrial bioenergetics and thereby prevents secretory lineage commitment in a cell-intrinsic manner. Oral α-ketoglutarate supplementation bolsters ISC differentiation and confers resilience to stress-triggered intestinal epithelial injury. We confirm that fecal IAA is higher in patients with mental distress and is correlated with gut dysfunction. These findings uncover a microbe-mediated brain-gut pathway that could be therapeutically targeted for stress-driven gut-brain comorbidities.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental contaminant with endocrine-disrupting properties that induce fetal growth restriction (FGR). Previous studies on pregnant ewes revealed that BPA exposure causes placental apoptosis and oxidative stress (OS) and decreases placental efficiency, consequently leading to FGR. Nonetheless, the response of gut microbiota to BPA exposure and its role in aggravating BPA-mediated apoptosis, autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and OS of the maternal placenta and intestine are unclear in an ovine model of gestation.

Seagrasses offer various ecosystem services and possess high levels of primary productivity. However, the development of mariculture has affected the homeostasis of seagrass meadow ecosystems. Plant-microbiome associations are essential for seagrasses health, but little is known about the role of environmental microbiomes and how they affect seagrass in a mariculture environment. In this study, we investigated the influence of mariculture on the rhizosphere and seawater microbiome surrounding Zostera marina and focused on the bacterial, eukaryotic, and fungal components in the composition, diversity, metabolism, and responses to mariculture-related environmental factors.

Urbanization has an ecological and evolutionary effect on urban microorganisms. Microorganisms are fundamental to ecosystem functions, such as global biogeochemical cycles, biodegradation and biotransformation of pollutants, and restoration and maintenance of ecosystems. Changes in microbial communities can disrupt these essential processes, leading to imbalances within ecosystems. Studying the impact of human activities on urban microbes is critical to protecting the environment, human health, and overall urban sustainability.

## The exometabolome of microbial communities inhabiting bare ice surfaces on the southern Greenland Ice Sheet.
 20.02.2024, _EL Doting, MB Jensen, EK Peter, L Ellegaard-Jensen, M Tranter, LG Benning, M Hansen, AM Anesio_


_Ice Cover, Greenland, Microbiota, Seasons_
Microbial blooms colonize the Greenland Ice Sheet bare ice surface during the ablation season and significantly reduce its albedo. On the ice surface, microbes are exposed to high levels of irradiance, freeze-thaw cycles, and low nutrient concentrations. It is well known that microorganisms secrete metabolites to maintain homeostasis, communicate with other microorganisms, and defend themselves. Yet, the exometabolome of supraglacial microbial blooms, dominated by the pigmented glacier ice algae Ancylonema alaskanum and Ancylonema nordenskiöldii, remains thus far unstudied. Here, we use a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics workflow to identify metabolites in the exometabolome of microbial blooms on the surface of the southern tip of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Samples were collected every 6 h across two diurnal cycles at 5 replicate sampling sites with high similarity in community composition, in terms of orders and phyla present. Time of sampling explained 46% (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA], pseudo-F = 3.7771, p = 0.001) and 27% (PERMANOVA, pseudo-F = 1.8705, p = 0.001) of variance in the exometabolome across the two diurnal cycles. Annotated metabolites included riboflavin, lumichrome, tryptophan, and azelaic acid, all of which have demonstrated roles in microbe-microbe interactions in other ecosystems and should be tested for potential roles in the development of microbial blooms on bare ice surfaces.

_Geologic Sediments, Carbonates, Calcium Carbonate, Microbiota_
Micritization is an early diagenetic process that gradually alters primary carbonate sediment grains through cycles of dissolution and reprecipitation of microcrystalline calcite (micrite). Typically observed in modern shallow marine environments, micritic textures have been recognized as a vital component of storage and flow in hydrocarbon reservoirs, attracting scientific and economic interests. Due to their endolithic activity and the ability to promote nucleation and reprecipitation of carbonate crystals, microorganisms have progressively been shown to be key players in micritization, placing this process at the boundary between the geological and biological realms. However, published research is mainly based on geological and geochemical perspectives, overlooking the biological and ecological complexity of microbial communities of micritized sediments. In this paper, we summarize the state-of-the-art and research gaps in micritization from a microbial ecology perspective. Since a growing body of literature successfully applies in vitro and in situ 'fishing' strategies to unveil elusive microorganisms and expand our knowledge of microbial diversity, we encourage their application to the study of micritization. By employing these strategies in micritization research, we advocate promoting an interdisciplinary approach/perspective to identify and understand the overlooked/neglected microbial players and key pathways governing this phenomenon and their ecology/dynamics, reshaping our comprehension of this process.

Traditional alcoholic beverages have played a significant role in the cultural, social, and culinary fabric of societies worldwide for centuries. Studying the microbial community structure and their metabolic potential in such beverages is necessary to define product quality, safety, and consistency, as well as to explore associated biotechnological applications. In the present investigation, Illumina-based (MiSeq system) whole-genome shotgun sequencing was utilized to characterize the microbial diversity and conduct predictive gene function analysis of keem, a starter culture employed by the Jaunsari tribal community in India for producing various traditional alcoholic beverages. A total of 8,665,213 sequences, with an average base length of 151 bps, were analyzed using MG-RAST. The analysis revealed the dominance of bacteria (95.81%), followed by eukaryotes (4.11%), archaea (0.05%), and viruses (0.03%). At the phylum level, Actinobacteria (81.18%) was the most abundant, followed by Firmicutes (10.56%), Proteobacteria (4.00%), and Ascomycota (3.02%). The most predominant genera were Saccharopolyspora (36.31%), followed by Brevibacterium (15.49%), Streptomyces (9.52%), Staphylococcus (8.75%), Bacillus (4.59%), and Brachybacterium (3.42%). At the species level, the bacterial, fungal, and viral populations of the keem sample could be categorized into 3347, 57, and 106 species, respectively. Various functional attributes to the sequenced data were assigned using Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG), Non-supervised Orthologous Groups (NOG), subsystem, and KEGG Orthology (KO) annotations. The most prevalent metabolic pathways included carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, as well as the biosynthesis of glycans, secondary metabolites, and xenobiotic biodegradation. Given the rich microbial diversity and its associated metabolic potential, investigating the transition of keem from a traditional starter culture to an industrial one presents a compelling avenue for future research.
