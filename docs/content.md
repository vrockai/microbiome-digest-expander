Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the gut microbiota have beneficial anti-inflammatory and gut homeostasis effects and prevent type 1 diabetes (T1D) in mice. Reduced SCFA production indicates a loss of beneficial bacteria, commonly associated with chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including T1D and type 2 diabetes. Here, we addressed whether a metabolite-based dietary supplement has an impact on humans with T1D. We conducted a single-arm pilot-and-feasibility trial with high-amylose maize-resistant starch modified with acetate and butyrate (HAMSAB) to assess safety, while monitoring changes in the gut microbiota in alignment with modulation of the immune system status.

## The vaginal Torquetenovirus titer varies with vaginal microbiota composition in pregnant women.
 24.01.2022, _TR Tozetto-Mendoza, MC Mendes-Correa, AF Moron, LJ Forney, IM Linhares, A Ribeiro da Silva, L Honorato, SS Witkin_


Torquetenovirus (TTV) is a nonpathogenic endogenous virus whose abundance varies with the extent of immune system activation. We determined if the TTV titer in the vagina of pregnant women was associated with vaginal microbiota composition and levels of compounds in vaginal secretions. Vaginal TTV and microbiota composition in 494 second trimester pregnant women were identified by gene amplification and analysis. Vaginal matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP) and lactic acid isomers were measured by ELISA. Dominance was defined as the relative abundance of a specific bacterium or species at &gt;50% of the total number of bacteria identified. Clinical data were obtained by chart review. The median log10 TTV titer was lowest when Lactobacillus species other than L. iners were dominant (&lt;1.0) as compared to when L. iners (4.1, p = 0.0001), bacteria other than lactobacilli (4.5, p = 0.0016) or no bacterium (4.7, p = 0.0009) dominated. The TTV titer was inversely proportional to L. crispatus abundance (p&lt;0.0001) and directly proportional to levels of G. vaginalis (p = 0.0008) and L. iners (p = 0.0010). The TTV titer was proportional to TIMP-1, TIMP-2, MMP-8 and MMP-9 abundance (p≤0.0002) and inversely proportional to the level of D-lactic acid (p = 0.0024). We conclude that the association between variations in the TTV titer and the relative abundance of specific bacterial species and vaginal compounds indicates that local changes in immune status likely influence vaginal fluid composition.

## Gut microbiome alterations and gut barrier dysfunction are associated with host immune homeostasis in COVID-19 patients.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease characterized by multiple respiratory and extrapulmonary manifestations, including gastrointestinal symptoms. Although recent studies have linked gut microbiota to infectious diseases such as influenza, little is known about the role of the gut microbiota in COVID-19 pathophysiology.

## Predicting Treatment Nonresponse in Hispanic/Latino Children Receiving Silver Diamine Fluoride for Caries Arrest: A Pilot Study Using Machine Learning.
 21.01.2022, _RR Ruff, B Paul, MA Sierra, F Xu, X Li, YO Crystal, D Saxena_


Objectives: Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a nonsurgical therapy for the arrest and prevention of dental caries with demonstrated clinical efficacy. Approximately 20% of children receiving SDF fail to respond to treatment. The objective of this study was to develop a predictive model of treatment non-response using machine learning. Methods: An observational pilot study (N = 20) consisting of children with and without active decay and who did and did not respond to silver diamine fluoride provided salivary samples and plaque from infected and contralateral sites. 16S rRNA genes from samples were amplified and sequenced on an Illumina Miseq and analyzed using QIIME. The association between operational taxonomic units and treatment non-response was assessed using lasso regression and artificial neural networks. Results: Bivariate group comparisons of bacterial abundance indicate a number of genera were significantly different between non-responders and those who responded to SDF therapy. No differences were found between non-responders and caries-active subjects. Prevotella pallens and Veillonella denticariosi were retained in full lasso models and combined with clinical variables in a six-input multilayer perceptron. Discussion: The acidogenic and acid-tolerant nature of retained bacterial species may overcome the antimicrobial effects of SDF. Further research to validate the model in larger external samples is needed.

Previous studies have demonstrated an association between gut microbiota composition and type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis. However, little is known about the composition and function of the gut microbiome in adults with longstanding T1D or its association with host glycemic control.

## Frontiers in Oral Mucosal Immunity and the Microbiome.
 21.01.2022, _GN Belibasakis, G Hajishengallis_


The 2nd International Conference on Oral Mucosal Immunity and the Microbiome (OMIM) took place at the Grecotel Kos Imperial Hotel, Kos, Greece, between 25th and 30th September 2021, under the auspices of the Aegean Conferences. This has only been the second Aegean Conference of this thematic, the first one having taken place in 2018 in Crete, during the same period of the year. Given the hardships in travel and heightened infection transmission risks amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Conference was well attended by 29 international speakers across the world. For many of the participants, this was the first conference travel in the post-pandemic era, and quite significant that it has taken place on the island of Hippocrates. Stringent regional health and safety regulations had to be followed to accomplish for this in-person Conference to take place. Frontiers in Oral Health has hosted papers from presentations of the Conference, whereas the present article serves as the proceedings of the Conference with summaries of the presentations.
