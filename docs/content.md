## The early life education of the immune system: Moms, microbes and (missed) opportunities.
 12.10.2020, _N Jain_


The early life immune system is characterized by unique developmental milestones. Functionally diverse immune cells arise from distinct waves of hematopoietic stem cells, a phenomenon referred to as 'layered' immunity. This stratified development of immune cells extends to lineages of both innate and adaptive cells. The defined time window for the development of these immune cells lends itself to the influence of specific exposures typical of the early life period. The perinatal immune system develops in a relatively sterile fetal environment but emerges into one filled with a multitude of antigenic encounters. A major burden of this comes in the form of the microbiota that is being newly established at mucosal surfaces of the newborn. Accumulating evidence suggests that early life microbial exposures, including those arising in utero, can imprint long-lasting changes in the offspring's immune system and determine disease risk throughout life. In this review, I highlight unique features of early life immunity and explore the role of intestinal bacteria in educating the developing immune system.

The maternal vaginal microbiome is an important source for infant gut microbiome development. However, infants delivered by Cesarean section (CS) do not contact the maternal vaginal microbiome and this delivery method may perturb the early establishment and development of the gut microbiome. The aim of this study was to investigate the early gut microbiota of Korean newborns receiving the same postpartum care services for two weeks after birth by delivery mode using fecal samples collected at days 3, 7, and 14. Early gut microbiota development patterns were examined using 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing from 132 infants either born vaginally (VD, n = 64) or via Cesarean section (CS, n = 68). VD-born neonates showed increased alpha diversity in infant fecal samples collated at days 7 and 14 compared to those from day 3, while those of CS infants did not differ (p &lt; 0.015). Bacterial structures of infants from both groups separated at day 7 (p &lt; 0.001) and day 14 (p &lt; 0.01). The bacterial structure of VD infants gradually changed over time (day 3 vs. day 7, p &lt; 0.012; day 3 vs. day 14, p &lt; 0.001). Day 14 samples of CS infants differed from day 3 and 7 samples (day 3 vs. day 14, p &lt; 0.001). VD infant relative abundance of Bifidobacterium (days 7, 14), Bacteroides (days 7, 14), and Lachnospiraceae (day 7) significantly increased compared to CS infants, with a lower abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (found in all periods of the CS group) (LDA &gt; 3.0). Relative abundances of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Staphylococcus were significantly increased in both VD and CS groups at day 14 (LDA &gt; 3.0). Predicted functional analysis showed that VD infants had overrepresented starch/sucrose, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism in gut microbiota with depleted lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis until day 14 compared to CS infants. This study confirmed that delivery mode is the major determinant of neonatal intestinal microbiome establishment and provides a profile of microbiota perturbations in CS infants. Our findings provide preliminary insight for establishing recovery methods to supply the specific microbes missing in CS infants.

## Proteins produced by Streptococcus species in the lower respiratory tract can modify antiviral responses against influenza virus in respiratory epithelial cells.
 10.10.2020, _K Nishioka, M Kyo, T Nakaya, N Shime_


Seasonal influenza spreads during winter in temperate countries. Primary viral pneumoniae resulting from aggravation triggers acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a serious respiratory disorder. We have identified a unique pattern of lung microbiota in patients with the syndrome. In this study, we hypothesized that the unique microbiota was also associated with primary influenza viral pneumoniae. Bacterial culture supernatants of Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus mitis detected from the patients significantly increased viral replication (maximum 10-fold increase) in lung epithelial cells. Our results suggest that the lung environment microbiota is significantly involved in viral replication.
