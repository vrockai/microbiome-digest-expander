_Ascomycota, Bacteria, COVID-19, Dysbiosis, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Mycobiome, SARS-CoV-2_
Clinical and experimental studies indicate that the bacterial and fungal gut microbiota modulates immune responses in distant organs including the lungs. Immune dysregulation is associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and several groups have observed gut bacterial dysbiosis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, while the fungal gut microbiota remains poorly defined in these patients. We analyzed the fungal gut microbiome from rectal swabs taken prior to anti-infective treatment in 30 SARS-CoV-2 positive (21 non-severe COVID-19 and 9 developing severe/critical COVID-19 patients) and 23 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients by ITS2-sequencing. Pronounced but distinct interconnected fungal communities distinguished SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. Fungal gut microbiota in severe/critical COVID-19 illness was characterized by a reduced diversity, richness and evenness and by an increase of the relative abundance of the Ascomycota phylum compared with non-severe COVID-19 illness. A dominance of a single fungal species with a relative abundance of &gt;75% was a frequent feature in severe/critical COVID-19. The dominating fungal species were highly variable between patients even within the groups. Several fungal taxa were depleted in patients with severe/critical COVID-19.The distinct compositional changes of the fungal gut microbiome in SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in severe COVID-19 illness, illuminate the necessity of a broader approach to investigate whether the differences in the fungal gut microbiome are consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection or a predisposing factor for critical illness.

## Insights into the Profile of the Human Expiratory Microbiota and Its Associations with Indoor Microbiotas.
 05.05.2022, _Y Zhang, F Shen, Y Yang, M Niu, D Chen, L Chen, S Wang, Y Zheng, Y Sun, F Zhou, H Qian, Y Wu, T Zhu_


Microorganisms residing in the human respiratory tract can be exhaled, and they constitute a part of environmental microbiotas. However, the expiratory microbiota community and its associations with environmental microbiotas remain poorly understood. Here, expiratory bacteria and fungi and the corresponding microbiotas from the living environments were characterized by DNA amplicon sequencing of residents' exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and environmental samples collected from 14 residences in Nanjing, China. The microbiotas of EBC samples, with a substantial heterogeneity, were found to be as diverse as those of skin, floor dust, and airborne microbiotas. Model fitting results demonstrated the role of stochastic processes in the assembly of the expiratory microbiota. Using a fast expectation-maximization algorithm, microbial community analysis revealed that expiratory microbiotas were differentially associated with other types of microbiotas in a type-dependent and residence-specific manner. Importantly, the expiratory bacteria showed a composition similarity with airborne bacteria in the bathroom and kitchen environments with an average of 12.60%, while the expiratory fungi showed a 53.99% composition similarity with the floor dust fungi. These differential patterns indicate different relationships between expiratory microbiotas and the airborne microbiotas and floor dust microbiotas. The results here illustrated for the first time the associations between expiratory microbiotas and indoor microbiotas, showing a potential microbial exchange between the respiratory tract and indoor environment. Thus, improved hygiene and ventilation practices can be implemented to optimize the indoor microbial exposome, especially in indoor bathrooms and kitchens.

Microbiome dysbiosis is associated with inflammatory destruction in Crohn's Disease (CD). Although gut microbiome dysbiosis is well-established in CD, the oral microbiome is comparatively under-studied. This study aims to characterize the oral microbiome of CD patients with/without oral manifestations.

## Addressing virtual reality misclassification: A hardware-based qualification matrix for virtual reality technology.
 25.11.2021, _M Takac, J Collett, R Conduit, A De Foe_


_Humans, Reproducibility of Results, Technology, Virtual Reality, Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy_
Through its unique sensory synchronized design, virtual reality (VR) provides a convincing, user-centred experience of highly controllable scenarios. Importantly, VR is a promising modality for healthcare, where treatment efficacy has been recognized for a range of conditions. It is equally valuable across wider research disciplines. However, there is a lack of suitable criteria and consistent terminology with which to define VR technology. A considerable number of studies have misclassified VR hardware (e.g. defining laptops as VR), hindering validity and research comparisons. This review addresses these limitations and establishes a standardized VR qualification framework. As a result of a comprehensive theoretical and literature review, the hardware-based VR qualification matrix is proposed. The matrix criteria consist of (1) three-dimensional (3D) synchronized sensory stimulation; (2) degrees of freedom tracking; and (3) visual suppression of physical stimuli. To validate the model and quantify the current scale/diversity of VR misclassification, a 2019 sectional review of health-related studies was conducted. Of the 115 studies examined against standardized criteria, 35.7% utilized VR, 31.3% misclassified VR, 18.3% were considered quasi-VR, and 14.8% omitted critical specifications. The proposed model demonstrates good validity and reliability for qualifying and classifying VR. Key Practitioner Messages Virtual reality (VR) therapy has gained rapid empirical support, although many practitioners do not understand the difference between genuine and less-realistic VR variations. That has resulted from an evident lack of suitable criteria to define VR across a range of studies and protocols. Our proposed hardware-based virtual reality qualification matrix addresses issues to do with misclassification, via the introduction of standardised criteria. Applying the matrix to existing literature has revealed that more than 30% of VR studies use hardware that does not fit the high standards of rigour required for immersion in a simulated space. The model is a practical tool researchers and practitioners can use to quality and verify VR standards across research studies.

## The Game for Three: Salmonella-Host-Microbiota Interaction Models.
 07.05.2022, _K Grzymajlo_


Colonization of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by enteric pathogens occurs in a context strongly determined by host-specific gut microbiota, which can significantly affect the outcome of infection. The complex gameplay between the trillions of microbes that inhabit the GI tract, the host, and the infecting pathogen defines a specific triangle of interaction; therefore, a complete model of infection should consider all of these elements. Many different infection models have been developed to explain the complexity of these interactions. This review sheds light on current knowledge, along with the strengths and limitations of in vitro and in vivo models utilized in the study of Salmonella-host-microbiome interactions. These models range from the simplest experiment simulating environmental conditions using dedicated growth media through in vitro interaction with cell lines and 3-D organoid structure, and sophisticated "gut on a chip" systems, ending in various animal models. Finally, the challenges facing this field of research and the important future directions are outlined.

## Host gene effects on gut microbiota in type 1 diabetes.
 06.05.2022, _K Guo, J Huang, Z Zhou_


Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease characterized by progressive pancreatic β-cell loss. Both a predisposing genetic background, that may encompass mutations in several genes, as well as exposure to environmental factors can affect the progression of autoimmune responses to multiple pancreatic islet autoantigens. Many genetic variants that increase the risk of T1D are found in immunity genes involved in sensing and responding to microorganisms. Although increasing evidence indicates that the gut microbiome composition may promote or prevent T1D development, little is known about the link between gut microbiota and T1D susceptibility genes in patients with T1D. Recent studies in the inbred non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a widely used model of T1D, have suggested that many genetic loci can influence gut microbiome composition to modulate islet autoimmunity. This review summarizes evidence that examines the effect of host genes on gut microbiota diversity and function during T1D development. Knowledge of the host gene-gut microbiota interactions at play during T1D progression may help us identify new diagnostic and prognostic tools and help also design effective strategies for disease treatment.

## Host-microbial interactions in metabolic diseases: from diet to immunity.
 05.05.2022, _JH Lee, JH Park_


Growing evidence suggests that the gut microbiome is an important contributor to metabolic diseases. Alterations in microbial communities are associated with changes in lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, intestinal barrier functions, and chronic inflammation, all of which can lead to metabolic disorders. Therefore, the gut microbiome may represent a novel therapeutic target for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This review discusses how gut microbes and their products affect metabolic diseases and outlines potential treatment approaches via manipulation of the gut microbiome. Increasing our understanding of the interactions between the gut microbiome and host metabolism may help restore the healthy symbiotic relationship between them.
