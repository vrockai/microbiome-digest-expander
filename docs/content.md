## Feasibility of implementing the World Health Organization case management guideline for possible serious bacterial infection among young infants in Ntcheu district, Malawi.
 17.04.2020, _T Guenther, G Mopiwa, H Nsona, S Qazi, R Makuluni, CB Fundani, J Gomezgani, L Mgalula, M Chisema, S Sadruddin_


Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of mortality, yet the recommended inpatient treatment options are inaccessible to most families in low-income settings. In 2015, the World Health Organization released a guideline for outpatient treatment of young infants (0-59 days of age) with possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI) with simplified antibiotic regimens when referral was not feasible. If implemented widely, this guideline could prevent many deaths. Our implementation research evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the WHO guideline through the existing health system in Malawi.

When maize (Zea mays L.) is grown in the Northern hemisphere, its development is heavily arrested by chilling temperatures, especially at the juvenile phase. As some endophytes are beneficial for plants under stress conditions, we analyzed the impact of chilling temperatures on the root microbiome and examined whether microbiome-based analysis might help to identify bacterial strains that could promote growth under these temperatures.

## Microbiota-immune interactions in asthma pathogenesis and phenotype.
 22.04.2020, _NW Lukacs, YJ Huang_


The complexity and the mechanistic role of microbial communities at mucosal surfaces are only now beginning to be understood. Their impact on host metabolism, development, and immune responses to infectious and inert stimuli may be centrally linked to the metabolic functions of these communities within the established microbiome. The structure and function of microbial communities are influenced both early and throughout life by many environmental factors, exposures, diet, and disease. Understanding how the microbiome influences the host during health is likely just as important as understanding how it influences asthmatic disease predisposition and severity.

Human microbiomes are predicted to assemble in a reproducible and ordered manner yet there is limited knowledge on the development of the complex bacterial communities that constitute the oral microbiome. The oral microbiome plays major roles in many oral diseases including early childhood caries (ECC), which afflicts up to 70% of children in some countries. Saliva contains oral bacteria that are indicative of the whole oral microbiome and may have the ability to reflect the dysbiosis in supragingival plaque communities that initiates the clinical manifestations of ECC. The aim of this study was to determine the assembly of the oral microbiome during the first four years of life and compare it with the clinical development of ECC. The oral microbiomes of 134 children enrolled in a birth cohort study were determined at six ages between two months and four years-of-age and their mother's oral microbiome was determined at a single time point. We identified and quantified 356 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacteria in saliva by sequencing the V4 region of the bacterial 16S RNA genes. Bacterial alpha diversity increased from a mean of 31 OTUs in the saliva of infants at 1.9 months-of-age to 84 OTUs at 39 months-of-age. The oral microbiome showed a distinct shift in composition as the children matured. The microbiome data were compared with the clinical development of ECC in the cohort at 39, 48, and 60 months-of-age as determined by ICDAS-II assessment. Streptococcus mutans was the most discriminatory oral bacterial species between health and current disease, with an increased abundance in disease. Overall our study demonstrates an ordered temporal development of the oral microbiome, describes a limited core oral microbiome and indicates that saliva testing of infants may help predict ECC risk.

## Compromised angiogenesis and vascular Integrity in impaired diabetic wound healing.
 23.04.2020, _UA Okonkwo, L Chen, D Ma, VA Haywood, M Barakat, N Urao, LA DiPietro_


Vascular deficits are a fundamental contributing factor of diabetes-associated diseases. Although previous studies have demonstrated that the pro-angiogenic phase of wound healing is blunted in diabetes, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that regulate skin revascularization and capillary stabilization in diabetic wounds is lacking. Using a mouse model of diabetic wound healing, we performed microCT analysis of the 3-dimensional architecture of the capillary bed. As compared to wild type, vessel surface area, branch junction number, total vessel length, and total branch number were significantly decreased in wounds of diabetic mice as compared to WT mice. Diabetic mouse wounds also had significantly increased capillary permeability and decreased pericyte coverage of capillaries. Diabetic wounds exhibited significant perturbations in the expression of factors that affect vascular regrowth, maturation and stability. Specifically, the expression of VEGF-A, Sprouty2, PEDF, LRP6, Thrombospondin 1, CXCL10, CXCR3, PDGFR-β, HB-EGF, EGFR, TGF-β1, Semaphorin3a, Neuropilin 1, angiopoietin 2, NG2, and RGS5 were down-regulated in diabetic wounds. Together, these studies provide novel information about the complexity of the perturbation of angiogenesis in diabetic wounds. Targeting factors responsible for wound resolution and vascular pruning, as well those that affect pericyte recruitment, maturation, and stability may have the potential to improve diabetic skin wound healing.

## Effect of chicory inulin-type fructan-containing snack bars on the human gut microbiota in low dietary fiber consumers in a randomized crossover trial.
 22.04.2020, _RA Reimer, A Soto-Vaca, AC Nicolucci, S Mayengbam, H Park, KL Madsen, R Menon, EE Vaughan_


The low intake of dietary fiber compared to recommended amounts has been referred to as the dietary fiber gap. The addition of fiber to snack foods could favorably alter gut microbiota and help individuals meet intake recommendations.

## Effect of in feed administration of different butyrate formulations on Salmonella Enteritidis colonization and cecal microbiota in broilers.
 20.04.2020, _L Onrust, S Baeyen, F Haesebrouck, R Ducatelle, F Van Immerseel_


Butyrate has been used extensively as a feed additive to improve gut health and to decrease Salmonella colonization in poultry. Salmonella mainly colonizes the ceca so butyrate concentrations should be increased in this gut segment. Discrepancies on the effects of butyrate on Salmonella colonization, described in the scientific literature, could thus be due to butyrate release location effects. In this study, newly developed butyrate formulations were evaluated for their effect on cecal butyrate concentrations and on colonization by Salmonella Enteritidis. In a first trial, broilers were randomly allocated to 7 dietary treatment groups with formulations based on different approaches to modify the butyrate release profile: release from wax matrices based on diffusion/erosion; micropellets supposedly release butyrate around pH 7 in the colon; tributyrin is based on the hydrolysis of esters in the small intestine. Fat-protected butyrate was included as a reference, because of its known effect on reduction of Salmonella colonization. Four days after infection, the number of cfu Salmonella per g cecal content and spleen were determined. Butyrate formulations in a wax matrix significantly reduced the Salmonella colonization in cecal content. In a second trial, wax and fat-protected butyrate treatments were replicated and results from the first trial were confirmed. Compared to the control group a higher proportion of butyrate concentration was observed in ceca for those groups with reduced Salmonella colonization. This was associated with a beneficial shift in the cecal microbiota. In conclusion, formulations that increase cecal butyrate concentrations are superior in protecting against Salmonella Enteritidis colonization.

## Stochasticity constrained by deterministic effects of diet and age drive rumen microbiome assembly dynamics.
 21.04.2020, _O Furman, L Shenhav, G Sasson, F Kokou, H Honig, S Jacoby, T Hertz, OX Cordero, E Halperin, I Mizrahi_


How complex communities assemble through the animal's life, and how predictable the process is remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the forces that drive the assembly of rumen microbiomes throughout a cow's life, with emphasis on the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes. We analyse the development of the rumen microbiome from birth to adulthood using 16S-rRNA amplicon sequencing data and find that the animals shared a group of core successional species that invaded early on and persisted until adulthood. Along with deterministic factors, such as age and diet, early arriving species exerted strong priority effects, whereby dynamics of late successional taxa were strongly dependent on microbiome composition at early life stages. Priority effects also manifest as dramatic changes in microbiome development dynamics between animals delivered by C-section vs. natural birth, with the former undergoing much more rapid species invasion and accelerated microbiome development. Overall, our findings show that together with strong deterministic constrains imposed by diet and age, stochastic colonization in early life has long-lasting impacts on the development of animal microbiomes.

## Sequence variant analysis reveals poor correlations in microbial taxonomic abundance between humans and mice after gnotobiotic transfer.

Transplanting human gut microbiotas into germ-free (GF) mice is a popular approach to disentangle cause-and-effect relationships between enteric microbes and disease. Algorithm development has enabled sequence variant (SV) identification from 16S rRNA gene sequence data. SV analyses can identify which donor taxa colonize recipient GF mice, and how SV abundance in humans is replicated in these mice. Fecal microbiotas from 8 human subjects were used to generate 77 slurries, which were transplanted into 153 GF mice. Strong correlations between fecal and slurry microbial communities were observed; however, only 42.15 ± 9.95% of SVs successfully transferred from the donor to the corresponding recipient mouse. Firmicutes had a particularly low transfer rate and SV abundance was poorly correlated between donor and recipient pairs. Our study confirms human fecal microbiotas colonize formerly GF mice, but the engrafted community only partially resembles the input human communities. Our findings emphasize the importance of reporting a standardized transfer rate and merit the exploration of other animal models or in silico tools to understand the relationships between human gut microbiotas and disease.

## Temporal changes in microbial communities attached to forages with different lignocellulosic compositions in the cattle rumen.
 18.04.2020, _J Gharechahi, MF Vahidi, XZ Ding, JL Han, GH Salekdeh_


The attachment of rumen microbes to feed particles is critical to feed fermentation, degradation and digestion. However, the extent to which the physicochemical properties of feeds influence the colonization by rumen microbes is still unclear. We hypothesized that rumen microbial communities may have differential preferences for attachments to feeds with varying lignocellulose properties. To this end, the structure and composition of microbial communities attached to six common forages with different lignocellulosic compositions were analyzed following in situ rumen incubation in male Taleshi cattle. The results showed that differences in lignocellulosic compositions significantly affected the inter-sample diversity of forage-attached microbial communities in the first 24 hours (h) of rumen incubation, during which the highest dry matter degradation was achieved. However, extension of the incubation to 96 h resulted in the development of more uniform microbial communities across the forages. Fibrobacteres were significantly overrepresented in the bacterial communities attached to the forages with the highest neutral detergent fiber contents. Ruminococcus tended to attach to the forages with low acid detergent lignin contents. The extent of dry matter fermentation was significantly correlated with the populations of Fibrobacteraceae, unclassified Bacteroidales, Ruminococcaceae and Spirochaetacea. Our findings suggested that lignocellulosic compositions, more specifically the cellulose components, significantly affected the microbial attachment to and thus the final digestion of the forages.

## Host-microbiota interaction helps to explain the bottom-up effects of climate change on a small rodent species.
 21.04.2020, _G Li, B Yin, J Li, J Wang, W Wei, DI Bolnick, X Wan, B Zhu, Z Zhang_


The population cycles of small rodents have puzzled biologists for centuries. There is a growing recognition of the cascading effects of climate change on the population dynamics of rodents. However, the ultimate cause for the bottom-up effects of precipitation is poorly understood, from a microbial perspective. Here, we conducted a precipitation manipulation experiment in the field, and three feeding trials with controlled diets in the laboratory. We found precipitation supplementation facilitated the recovery of a perennial rhizomatous grass (Leymus chinensis) species, which altered the diet composition and increase the intake of fructose and fructooligosaccharides for Brandt's vole. Lab results showed that this nutrient shift was accompanied by the modulation of gut microbiota composition and functional pathways (especially for the degradation or biosynthesis of L-histidine). Particularly, the relative abundance of Eubacterium hallii was consistently increased after feeding voles with more L. chinensis, fructose or fructooligosaccharide. These modulations ultimately increased the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and boosted the growth of vole. This study provides evidence that the precipitation pulses cascades through the plant community to affect rodent gut microbiome. Our results highlight the importance of considering host-microbiota interaction when investigating rodent population responses to climate change.

## Regulatory relationship between quality variation and environment of Cistanche deserticola in three ecotypes based on soil microbiome analysis.
 21.04.2020, _X Sun, L Zhang, J Pei, LF Huang_


The environment affects the composition and function of soil microbiome, which indirectly influences the quality of plants. In this study, 16S amplicon sequencing was used to reveal the differences in soil microbial community composition of Cistanche deserticola in three ecotypes (saline-alkali land, grassland and sandy land). Through the correlation analysis of microbial community abundance, phenylethanoid glycoside contents and ecological factors, the regulatory relationship between microbial community and the quality variation of C. deserticola was expounded. The metabolic function profile of soil microbiome was predicted using Tax4Fun. Data showed that the soil microbial communities of the three ecotypes were significantly different (AMOVA, P &lt; 0.001), and the alpha diversity of grassland soil microbial community was the highest. Core microbiome analysis demonstrated that the soil microbial communities of C. deserticola were mostly have drought, salt tolerance, alkali resistance and stress resistance, such as Micrococcales and Bacillales. The biomarkers, namely, Oceanospirillales (saline-alkali land), Sphingomonadales (grassland) and Propionibacteriales (sandy land), which can distinguish three ecotype microbial communities, were excavated through LEfSe and random forest. Correlation analysis results demonstrated that 2'-acetylacteoside is positively correlated with Oceanospirillales in saline-alkali land soil. The metabolic function profiles displayed highly enriched metabolism (carbohydrate and amino acid metabolisms) and environmental information processing (membrane transport and signal transduction) pathways. Overall, the composition and function of soil microbiomes were found to be important factors to the quality variation of C. deserticola in different ecotypes. This work provided new insight into the regulatory relationship amongst the environment, soil microbial community and plant quality variation.

## Associations Between Respiratory Infections and Bacterial Microbiome in Student Dormitories in Northern China.
 18.04.2020, _X Fu, Y Li, Y Meng, Q Yuan, Z Zhang, D Norbäck, Y Deng, X Zhang, Y Sun_


Recent studies reveal that the microbial diversity and composition in the respiratory tract are related to the susceptibility, development and progression of respiratory infections. Indoor microorganisms can transmit into the respiratory tract through breathing, but their role in infections is unclear. Here we present the first association study between the indoor microbiome and respiratory infections. In total, 357 students living in 86 dormitory rooms in Shanxi University were randomly selected to survey symptoms of infections. Settled air dust was collected to characterize bacterial compositions by 16S rRNA sequencing. The overall microbial richness was not associated with respiratory infections, but microorganisms from specific phylogenetic classes showed various associations. Taxa richness and abundance of Actinobacteria were protectively associated with infections (p &lt; 0.05). The abundance of several genera in Gammaproteobacteria, including Haemophilus, Klebsiella, Buttiauxella and Raoultella, were positively associated with infections (p &lt; 0.005). The role of these microorganisms was consistent with previous human microbiota studies. Building age was associated with the overall microbial composition variation in dormitories and negatively associated with three potential risk genera in Proteobacteria (p &lt; 0.05). The weight of vacuum dust was positively associated with a protective genus, Micrococcus in Actinobacteria (p &lt; 0.05).

## Bacterial community analysis of floor dust and HEPA filters in air purifiers used in office rooms in ILAS, Beijing.
 20.04.2020, _J Guo, Y Xiong, T Kang, Z Xiang, C Qin_


Air purifiers with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters remove not only particulate matter but also airborne microorganisms in indoor environments. We investigated the bacterial community in HEPA filters (used for 1 year) and that in the floor dust of 12 office rooms in Beijing. We found that the viable bacteria proportion in the filter was significantly higher than that in the floor dust (p &lt; 0.001). The Non-Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling analysis showed that the bacterial communities in the filters and dust were significantly different (p = 0.001). The Chao1, Shannon-Wiener and phylogenetic diversity values in the filter were significantly higher than those in the dust (p &lt; 0.001). The predominant bacterial classes in the filter were Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, whereas those in the dust were Bacteroidia, Clostridia and Bacilli. Human occupancy contributed more to the bacterial community in the filter than that in the dust. Klebsiella and Alloprevotella in the dust and filters positively correlated with the occupancy density. Soil bacteria contributed to a significantly higher proportion of the bacteria in the HEPA filter (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, human oral, indoor air and outdoor haze contributed to a higher proportion of the bacteria in the dust samples (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). As HEPA filters serve as an ecological niche for indoor bacteria, they should be carefully investigated during the assessment of indoor environmental health.

Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight.

## Reaching a Large Urban Undergraduate Population through Microbial Ecology Course-Based Research Experiences.
 23.04.2020, _S Parks, JL Joyner, M Nusnbaum_


Traditional postsecondary education is making progress on embracing the diversity of student backgrounds and experiences while preparing them for the demands of STEM careers. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are effective tools to concurrently achieve many student and faculty goals: facilitating training of students, building career competencies, generating publishable research results and enabling research experiences where students apply their knowledge and interest. Georgia State University is not unique with a high student demand for research experiences and mentors that is greater than traditional research faculty labs can accommodate. Georgia State University is, however, unique in that it is a demographically diverse campus which serves minority and non-traditional students (i.e., second career and veterans) and is also rapidly growing. Therefore, to enhance the microbiology curriculum and facilitate authentic research experiences for the growing number of biology majors, a cluster of course-based research experiences in microbial ecology was developed. A former research lab space was converted to a collaborative teaching lab to serve the growth in course offerings, as well as to accommodate multiple microbial ecology research projects occurring in the same space. The courses offered appeal to students, build on the strengths of faculty experiences, and facilitate collaboration amongst students and with the greater Atlanta community. To ensure that our CUREs are accessible to the diverse students in our department, we addressed a variety of logistical and curricular challenges. Solutions to such challenges align with the goals of the university to offer research and signature experiences to ensure students are included and trained in STEM skills.
