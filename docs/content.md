## Toward an integrative framework for microbial community coalescence.
 01.10.2023, _GF Custer, L Bresciani, F Dini-Andreote_


Community coalescence is defined as the mixing of intact ecological communities. From river confluences to fecal microbiota transplantation, community coalescence constitutes a common ecological occurrence affecting natural and engineered microbial systems. In this opinion article, we propose an integrative framework for microbial community coalescence to guide advances in our understanding of this important - yet underexplored - ecological phenomenon. We start by aligning community coalescence with the unified framework of biological invasion and enumerate commonalities and idiosyncrasies between these two analogous processes. Then, we discuss how organismal interactions and cohesive establishment affect coalescence outcomes with direct implications for community functioning. Last, we propose the use of ecological null modeling to study the interplay of ecological processes structuring community reassembly following coalescence.

## Statistically learning the functional landscape of microbial communities.
 04.10.2023, _A Skwara, K Gowda, M Yousef, J Diaz-Colunga, AS Raman, A Sanchez, M Tikhonov, S Kuehn_


Microbial consortia exhibit complex functional properties in contexts ranging from soils to bioreactors to human hosts. Understanding how community composition determines function is a major goal of microbial ecology. Here we address this challenge using the concept of community-function landscapes-analogues to fitness landscapes-that capture how changes in community composition alter collective function. Using datasets that represent a broad set of community functions, from production/degradation of specific compounds to biomass generation, we show that statistically inferred landscapes quantitatively predict community functions from knowledge of species presence or absence. Crucially, community-function landscapes allow prediction without explicit knowledge of abundance dynamics or interactions between species and can be accurately trained using measurements from a small subset of all possible community compositions. The success of our approach arises from the fact that empirical community-function landscapes appear to be not rugged, meaning that they largely lack high-order epistatic contributions that would be difficult to fit with limited data. Finally, we show that this observation holds across a wide class of ecological models, suggesting community-function landscapes can be efficiently inferred across a broad range of ecological regimes. Our results open the door to the rational design of consortia without detailed knowledge of abundance dynamics or interactions.

In Lyme borreliosis, the skin constitutes a major interface for the host, the bacteria and the tick. Skin immunity is provided by specialized immune cells but also by the resident cells: the keratinocytes and the fibroblasts. Discoveries on the role of the microbiome in the modulation of skin inflammation and immunity have reinforced the potential importance of the skin in vector-borne diseases. In this study, we analyzed in vitro the interaction of human primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto N40 in presence or absence of bacterial commensal supernatants. We aimed to highlight the role of resident skin cells and skin microbiome on the inflammation induced by B. burgdorferi s.s.. The secretomes of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium striatum and Cutibacterium acnes showed an overall increase in the expression of IL-8, CXCL1, MCP-1 and SOD-2 by fibroblasts, and of IL-8, CXCL1, MCP-1 and hBD-2 in the undifferentiated keratinocytes. Commensal bacteria showed a repressive effect on the expression of IL-8, CXCL1 and MCP-1 by differentiated keratinocytes. Besides the inflammatory effect observed in the presence of Borrelia on all cell types, the cutaneous microbiome appears to promote a rapid innate response of resident skin cells during the onset of Borrelia infection.

## Microbiota-gut-brain axis drives overeating disorders.
 05.10.2023, _S Fan, W Guo, D Xiao, M Guan, T Liao, S Peng, A Feng, Z Wang, H Yin, M Li, J Chen, W Xiong_


Overeating disorders (ODs), usually stemming from dieting history and stress, remain a pervasive issue in contemporary society, with the pathological mechanisms largely unresolved. Here, we show that alterations in intestinal microbiota are responsible for the excessive intake of palatable foods in OD mice and patients with bulimia nervosa (BN). Stress combined with a history of dieting causes significant changes in the microbiota and the intestinal metabolism, which disinhibit the vagus nerve terminals in the gut and thereby lead to a subsequent hyperactivation of the gut-brain axis passing through the vagus, the solitary tract nucleus, and the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. The transplantation of a probiotic Faecalibacterium prausnitzii or dietary supplement of key metabolites restores the activity of the gut-to-brain pathway and thereby alleviates the OD symptoms. Thus, our study delineates how the microbiota-gut-brain axis mediates energy balance, unveils the underlying pathogenesis of the OD, and provides potential therapeutic strategies.

## Exploring gut microbiota in adult Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.): Associations with gut health and dietary prebiotics.
 06.10.2023, _J Wang, Y Li, A Jaramillo-Torres, O Einen, JV Jakobsen, Å Krogdahl, TM Kortner_


The importance of the gut microbiota for physiological processes in mammals is well established, but the knowledge of their functional roles in fish is still limited. The aims of this study were to investigate associations between variation in taxonomical composition of the gut microbiota and gut health status in Atlantic salmon and to explore possible modulatory effects of dietary prebiotics in one net-pen farm in open water. The fish with initial mean body weight of around 240 g were fed diets based on the same basal composition, either without (Ref diet) or with (Test diet) yeast cell wall based-prebiotics, during the marine production phase from December to September the following year. Sampling was conducted at three sampling time points: January, April, and September, with average water temperature of 3.9 ℃, 3.4 ℃ and 9.6 ℃, respectively.

## Using wasps as a tool to restore a functioning vine grape mycobiota and preserve the mycobial "terroir".

In the last one-hundred years, the exponential expansion of wine making has artificialized the agricultural landscape as well as its microbial diversity, spreading human selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Evidence showed that social wasps can harbor a significant fraction of the yeast phenotypic diversity of a given area of wine production, allowing different strains to overwinter and mate in their gut. The integrity of the wasp-yeast ecological interaction is of paramount importance to maintain the resilience of microbial populations associated to wine aromatic profiles. In a field experiment, we verified whether Polistes dominula wasps, reared in laboratory and fed with a traceable S. cerevisiae strain, could be a useful tool to drive the controlled yeast dispersion directly on grapes. The demonstration of the biotechnological potential of social insects in organic wine farming lays the foundations for multiple applications including maintenance of microbial biodiversity and rewilding vineyards through the introduction of wasp associated microbiomes.

## Soil microbes mediate the effects of resource variability on plant invasion.
 03.10.2023, _X Zhang, M van Kleunen, C Chang, Y Liu_


_Soil, Plants, Microbiota, Ecology, Introduced Species, Soil Microbiology_
A fundamental question in ecology is which species will prevail over others amid changes in both environmental mean conditions and their variability. Although the widely accepted fluctuating resource hypothesis predicts that increases in mean resource availability and variability therein will promote nonnative plant invasion, it remains unclear to what extent these effects might be mediated by soil microbes. We grew eight invasive nonnative plant species as target plants in pot-mesocosms planted with five different synthetic native communities as competitors, and assigned them to eight combinations of two nutrient-fluctuation (constant vs. pulsed), two nutrient-availability (low vs. high) and two soil-microbe (living vs. sterilized) treatments. We found that when plants grew in sterilized soil, nutrient fluctuation promoted the dominance of nonnative plants under overall low nutrient availability, whereas the nutrient fluctuation had minimal effect under high nutrient availability. In contrast, when plants grew in living soil, nutrient fluctuation promoted the dominance of nonnative plants under high nutrient availability rather than under low nutrient availability. Analysis of the soil microbial community suggests that this might reflect that nutrient fluctuation strongly increased the relative abundance of the most dominant pathogenic fungal family or genus under high nutrient availability, while decreasing it under low nutrient availability. Our findings are the first to indicate that besides its direct effect, environmental variability could also indirectly affect plant invasion via changes in soil microbial communities.

## INVADEseq to identify cell-adherent or invasive bacteria and the associated host transcriptome at single-cell-level resolution.
 03.10.2023, _JL Galeano Niño, H Wu, KD LaCourse, H Srinivasan, M Fitzgibbon, SS Minot, C Sather, CD Johnston, S Bullman_


Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) technologies have been beneficial in revealing and describing cellular heterogeneity within mammalian tissues, including solid tumors. However, many of these techniques apply poly(A) selection of RNA, and thus have primarily focused on determining the gene signatures of eukaryotic cellular components of the tumor microenvironment. Microbiome analysis has revealed the presence of microbial ecosystems, including bacteria and fungi, within human tumor tissues from major cancer types. Imaging data have revealed that intratumoral bacteria may be located within epithelial and immune cell types. However, as bacterial RNA typically lacks a poly(A) tail, standard scRNAseq approaches have limited ability to capture this microbial component of the tumor microenvironment. To overcome this, we describe the invasion-adhesion-directed expression sequencing (INVADEseq) approach, whereby we adapt 10x Genomics 5' scRNAseq protocol by introducing a primer that targets a conserved region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene in addition to the standard primer for eukaryotic poly(A) RNA selection. This 'add-on' approach enables the generation of eukaryotic and bacterial DNA libraries at eukaryotic single-cell level resolution, utilizing the 10x barcode to identify single cells with intracellular bacteria. The INVADEseq method takes 30 h to complete, including tissue processing, sequencing and computational analysis. As an output, INVADEseq has shown to be a reliable tool in human cancer cell lines and patient tumor specimens by detecting the proportion of human cells that harbor bacteria and the identities of human cells and intracellular bacteria, along with identifying host transcriptional programs that are modulated on the basis of associated bacteria.
