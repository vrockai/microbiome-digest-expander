This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.

## Carbon reduction trade-off between pretreatment and anaerobic digestion: A field study of an industrial-scale biogas plant.
 08.01.2024, _Z Shi, P He, J Guo, J Zou, W Peng, H Zhang, F Lü_


With the implementation of municipal solid waste source segregation, the enormous sorted biogenic waste has become an issue that needs to be seriously considered. Anaerobic digestion, which can produce biogas and extract floating oil for biodiesel production, is the most prevalent treatment in China for waste management and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, in accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 13 of the United Nations. Herein, a large-scale biogas plant with a capacity of 1000 tonnes of biogenic waste (400 tonnes of restaurant biogenic waste and 600 tonnes of kitchen biogenic waste) per day was investigated onsite using material flow analysis, and the parts of the biogas plant were thoroughly analyzed, especially the pretreatment system for biogenic waste impurity removal and homogenization. The results indicated that the loss of the total biodegradable organic matter was 41.8% (w/w) of daily feedstock and the loss of biogas potential was 18.8% (v/v) of daily feedstock. Life cycle assessment revealed that the 100-year GHG emissions were -61.2 kgCO2-eq per tonne biogenic waste. According to the sensitivity analysis, pretreatment efficiency, including biodegradable organic matter recovery and floating oil extraction, considerably affected carbon reduction potential. However, when the pretreatment efficiency deteriorated, GHG benefits of waste source segregation and the subsequent biogenic waste anaerobic digestion would be reduced.

## Depletion of JunB increases adipocyte thermogenic capacity and ameliorates diet-induced insulin resistance.
 08.01.2024, _X Zhang, X Ding, C Wang, Q Le, D Wu, A Song, G Huang, L Luo, Y Luo, X Yang, AE Goins, SP Desai, C Qiu, FD Silva, LE Feldman, J Zhou, MF Spafford, NH Boyd, ER Prossnitz, XO Yang, QA Wang, M Liu_


The coexistence of brown adipocytes with low and high thermogenic activity is a fundamental feature of brown adipose tissue heterogeneity and plasticity. However, the mechanisms that govern thermogenic adipocyte heterogeneity and its significance in obesity and metabolic disease remain poorly understood. Here we show that in male mice, a population of transcription factor jun-B (JunB)-enriched (JunB+) adipocytes within the brown adipose tissue exhibits lower thermogenic capacity compared to high-thermogenic adipocytes. The JunB+ adipocyte population expands in obesity. Depletion of JunB in adipocytes increases the fraction of adipocytes exhibiting high thermogenic capacity, leading to enhanced basal and cold-induced energy expenditure and protection against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, JunB antagonizes the stimulatory effects of PPARγ coactivator-1α on high-thermogenic adipocyte formation by directly binding to the promoter of oestrogen-related receptor alpha, a PPARγ coactivator-1α downstream effector. Taken together, our study uncovers that JunB shapes thermogenic adipocyte heterogeneity, serving a critical role in maintaining systemic metabolic health.

## A single intranasal dose of essential oil spray confers modulation of the nasopharyngeal microbiota and short-term inhibition of Mannheimia in feedlot cattle: a pilot study.
 09.01.2024, _G Magossi, KN Schmidt, TM Winders, ZE Carlson, DB Holman, SR Underdahl, KC Swanson, S Amat_


Five essential oils (EOs) were previously characterized in vitro and identified as candidate EOs for the development of an intranasal EO spray to mitigate bovine respiratory disease (BRD) pathogens. In the present study, these EOs were evaluated for their potential to (i) reduce BRD pathogens, (ii) modulate nasopharyngeal microbiota, and (iii) influence animal performance, feeding behavior and immune response when a single dose administered intranasally to feedlot cattle. Forty beef steer calves (7-8 months old, Initial body weight = 284 ± 5 kg [SE]) received either an intranasal EO spray (ajowan, thyme, fennel, cinnamon leaf, and citronella) or PBS (Control; n = 20/group) on day 0. Deep nasopharyngeal swabs were collected on days (d) -1, 1, 2, 7, 14, 28, and 42 and processed for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, qPCR, and culturing. Significant effects of EO on community structure (d1), microbial richness and diversity, relative abundance of some dominant phyla (d1, d2, and d14), and the overall interaction network structure of the nasopharyngeal microbiota were detected. The relative abundance of Mannheimia was lower in the EO calves (4.34%) than in Control calves (10.4%) on d2, and M. haemolytica prevalence on d7 as compared to control calves. Feed intake, average daily gain, feeding behavior, and blood cell counts were not affected by EO treatment. Overall, a single intranasal dose of EO spray resulted in moderate modulation of nasopharyngeal microbiota and short-term inhibition of Mannheimia while not influencing animal performance, feeding behavior or immune response. Our study, for the first time, shows the potential use of intranasal EO to mitigate BRD in feedlot cattle.

Nanodecoy systems based on analogues of viral cellular receptors assembled onto fluid lipid-based membranes of nano/extravescicles are potential new tools to complement classic therapeutic or preventive antiviral approaches. The need for lipid-based membranes for transmembrane receptor anchorage may pose technical challenges along industrial translation, calling for alternative geometries for receptor multimerization. Here we developed a semisynthetic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanodecoy by multimerizing the biotin labelled virus cell receptor -ACE2- ectodomain onto a poly-avidin nanoparticle (NP) based on the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly-ANANAS. The ability of the assembly to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and the affinity of the ACE2:viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction were measured at different ACE2:NP ratios. At ACE2:NP = 30, 90 % SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition at ACE2 nanomolar concentration was registered on both Wuhan and Omicron variants, with ten-fold higher potency than the monomeric protein. Lower and higher ACE2 densities were less efficient suggesting that functional recognition between multi-ligand NPs and multi-receptor virus surfaces requires optimal geometrical relationships. In vivo studies in mice showed that the biodistribution and safety profiles of the nanodecoy are potentially suitable for preventing viral infection upon nasal instillation. Viral receptor multimerization using ANANAS is a convenient process which, in principle, could be rapidly adapted to counteract also other viral infections.
