## Immune milieu and microbiome of the distal urethra in Ugandan men: impact of penile circumcision and implications for HIV susceptibility.

Coronal sulcus (CS) anaerobe abundance and IL-8 levels are linked to HIV acquisition, and are dramatically reduced after penile circumcision (PC). The distal urethra may be the site of some HIV acquisition before PC, and presumably most acquisition post PC. We describe the immune milieu and microbiome of the distal urethra in uncircumcised Ugandan men, and define the impact of PC. Participants consisted of HIV-negative, genital symptom-free adult Ugandan men undergoing PC (n = 51). Urethral and coronal sulcus swabs were collected at baseline and at 6- and 12-months post-PC. Soluble immune factors were quantified by multiplex ELISA, and bacterial abundance assessed by 16S rRNA qPCR and sequencing.

## Substantial overlap between symptomatic and asymptomatic genitourinary microbiota states.
 20.01.2022, _B Adu-Oppong, R Thänert, MA Wallace, CD Burnham, G Dantas_


The lack of a definition of urinary microbiome health convolutes diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs), especially when non-traditional uropathogens or paucity of bacteria are recovered from symptomatic patients in routine standard-of-care urine tests. Here, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterize the microbial composition of asymptomatic volunteers in a set of 30 longitudinally collected urine specimens. Using permutation tests, we established a range of asymptomatic microbiota states, and use these to contextualize the microbiota of 122 urine specimens collected from patients with suspected UTIs diagnostically categorized by standard-of-care urinalysis within that range. Finally, we used a standard-of-care culture protocol to evaluate the efficiency of culture-based recovery of the urinary microbiota.

## The influence of food processing methods on serum parameters, apparent total-tract macronutrient digestibility, fecal microbiota and SCFA content in adult beagles.
 22.01.2022, _X Cai, R Liao, G Chen, Y Lu, Y Zhao, Y Chen_


Food processing methods may influence the health of dogs. However, previous studies have mostly been based on a comparison of several commercial dog foods with different ingredients. In this study, eighteen adult beagles of the same age and health status (assessed by routine blood tests) were used in the experiments. This study analyzed the effects of the following different processing methods: raw, pasteurized, and high temperature sterilization (HTS) made with the same ingredients and nutrients (based on dry matter) on serum parameters, apparent total-tract macronutrient digestibility, fecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content in beagle dogs. The data showed, after a test lasting 56-days, the apparent digestibility (ATTD) of protein and fat in HTS food was 91.9%, which was significantly higher (P&lt; 0.05) than that in dry food (89.2%, P &lt; 0.05). The serum content of triglyceride increased in beagles fed HTS food (P &lt; 0.05), and the number of neutrophils in beagles fed raw food and pasteurized food increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05), and the platelet count in beagles fed raw food showed an increasing trend compared with the beagles fed HTS food. Different processing methods had an impact on the intestinal microbiota and SCFA of beagles; at least 14 genera were significantly affected by the food produced using different processing methods. In particular, the abundance of Allprevotella, Escherichia-Shigella and Turicibacter, and the total acid content were lower in beagles fed the raw diet, whereas Streptococcus, Collinsella, Bacteroides and Ruminococcus gnavus were more abundant following the HTS diet, and Lactococcus showed the highest abundance in beagles fed the pasteurized diet. This study showed that dog food produced by different processing methods affected the health of adult beagles.

## Kaempferol acts on bile acid signaling and gut microbiota to attenuate the tumor burden in ApcMin/+ mice.
 22.01.2022, _X Li, I Khan, G Huang, Y Lu, L Wang, Y Liu, L Lu, WLW Hsiao, Z Liu_


Emerging evidence points to a strong association between the bile acid (BA)-gut microbiota (GM) axis, and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Kaempferol, a common polyphenol in the daily diet, shows various pharmacological activities. However, it remains unclear about the effect of kaempferol on the CRC development and the BA-GM homeostasis. Here, we found kaempferol effectively reduced tumor burden, restored the damaged intestinal barrier and downregulated antigen Ki67 and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) expressions in ApcMin/+ mice. For BA metabolism, kaempferol reversed the decreasing trend in chenodesoxycholic acid (CDCA) and 12α-hydroxylated BAs by increasing the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) expressions, and upregulated FXR expression. Importantly, molecular docking analysis revealed a direct interaction between kaempferol and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the mater regulator of BA signaling. For GM analysis, we found higher abundances of species with anticancer properties and lower abundances of species associated with inflammation, obesity, and metabolic disorders in kaempferol-treated groups. Moreover, the gut of kaempferol-treated mice was predominantly colonized by short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and lactic acid producing bacteria. Based on the PICRUSt-predicted pathways of our GM dataset, we demonstrated that kaempferol downregulated secondary BA synthesis pathways, increased G protein-coupled receptor activity and decreased NOD-like receptor activity, affecting cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. Collectively, these results reveal that kaempferol effectively attenuates the tumor burden in ApcMin/+ mice by modulating the BA signaling and GM homeostasis.
