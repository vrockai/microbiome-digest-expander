Dietary fibers act through the microbiome to improve cardiovascular health and prevent metabolic disorders and cancer. To understand the health benefits of dietary fiber supplementation, we investigated two popular purified fibers, arabinoxylan (AX) and long-chain inulin (LCI), and a mixture of five fibers. We present multiomic signatures of metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, metagenomics, a cytokine panel, and clinical measurements on healthy and insulin-resistant participants. Each fiber is associated with fiber-dependent biochemical and microbial responses. AX consumption associates with a significant reduction in LDL and an increase in bile acids, contributing to its observed cholesterol reduction. LCI is associated with an increase in Bifidobacterium. However, at the highest LCI dose, there is increased inflammation and elevation in the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase. This study yields insights into the effects of fiber supplementation and the mechanisms behind fiber-induced cholesterol reduction, and it shows effects of individual, purified fibers on the microbiome.

## Stitching together a healthy gut microbiome with fiber.
 09.06.2022, _TM Schmidt_


Inter-individual variability in the gut microbiome confounds efforts to understand host responses to dietary fiber. In this issue of Cell Host &amp; Microbe, Lancaster et al. report individual and generalized host and microbiome responses in an interventional study of fiber supplements, motivating consideration of an alternative classification of fiber.

## Antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes in wastewater treatment plants: From occurrence to treatment strategies.
 09.06.2022, _S Li, BS Ondon, SH Ho, J Jiang, F Li_


This study aims to discuss the following: (1) occurrence and proliferation of antibiotic resistance in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs); (2) factors influencing antibiotic resistance bacteria and genes in WWTPs; (3) tools to assess antibiotic resistance in WWTPs; (4) environmental contamination of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from WWTPs; (5) effects of ARB and ARGs from WWTPs on human health; and (6) treatment strategies. In general, resistant and multi-resistant bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, exist in various processes of WWTPs. The existence of ARB and ARGs results from the high concentration of antibiotics in wastewater, which promote selective pressures on the local bacteria present in WWTPs. Thus, improving wastewater treatment technology and avoiding the misuse of antibiotics is critical to overcoming the threat of proliferation of ARBs and ARGs. Numerous factors can affect the development of ARB and ARGs in WWTPs. Abiotic factors can affect the bacterial community dynamics, thereby, affecting the applicability of ARB during the wastewater treatment process. Furthermore, the organic loads and other nutrients influence bacterial survival and growth. Specifically, molecular methods for the rapid characterization and detection of ARBs or their genes comprise DNA sequencing, real-time PCR, simple and multiplex PCR, and hybridization-based technologies, including micro- and macro-arrays. The reuse of effluent from WWTPs for irrigation is an efficient method to overcome water scarcity. However, there are also some potential environmental risks associated with this practice, such as increase in the levels of antibiotic resistance in the soil microbiome. Human mortality rates may significantly increase, as ARB can lead to resistance among several types of antibiotics or longer treatment times. Some treatment technologies, such as anaerobic and aerobic treatment, coagulation, membrane bioreactors, and disinfection processes, are considered potential techniques to restrict antibiotic resistance in the environment.
