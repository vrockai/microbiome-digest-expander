## Clinical and biological significance of RNA N6-methyladenosine regulators in Alzheimer disease.

RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulators are essential for a variety of biological functions, such as early development, viral infections, and cancer. However, their roles in Alzheimer disease (AD) are still not very clear. Here, 16 significant m6A regulators were identified using difference analysis between AD patients and non-demented controls based on the GSE132903 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Using these 16 m6A regulators, a nomogram model was established to predict the prevalence of AD. We found that patients could obtain a good clinical benefit based on this model. In addition, we revealed 2 distinct m6A patterns and 2 distinct m6A gene patterns in AD and demonstrated their prognostic and risk assessment significance. This present work comprehensively evaluated the functions of m6A regulators in the diagnosis and subtype classification of AD. These results suggested they have potential prognostic and risk assessment significance in AD.

_Humans, Bacteriophages, Metagenomics, Phylogeny, Viruses_
A universal taxonomy of viruses is essential for a comprehensive view of the virus world and for communicating the complicated evolutionary relationships among viruses. However, there are major differences in the conceptualisation and approaches to virus classification and nomenclature among virologists, clinicians, agronomists, and other interested parties. Here, we provide recommendations to guide the construction of a coherent and comprehensive virus taxonomy, based on expert scientific consensus. Firstly, assignments of viruses should be congruent with the best attainable reconstruction of their evolutionary histories, i.e., taxa should be monophyletic. This fundamental principle for classification of viruses is currently included in the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) code only for the rank of species. Secondly, phenotypic and ecological properties of viruses may inform, but not override, evolutionary relatedness in the placement of ranks. Thirdly, alternative classifications that consider phenotypic attributes, such as being vector-borne (e.g., "arboviruses"), infecting a certain type of host (e.g., "mycoviruses," "bacteriophages") or displaying specific pathogenicity (e.g., "human immunodeficiency viruses"), may serve important clinical and regulatory purposes but often create polyphyletic categories that do not reflect evolutionary relationships. Nevertheless, such classifications ought to be maintained if they serve the needs of specific communities or play a practical clinical or regulatory role. However, they should not be considered or called taxonomies. Finally, while an evolution-based framework enables viruses discovered by metagenomics to be incorporated into the ICTV taxonomy, there are essential requirements for quality control of the sequence data used for these assignments. Combined, these four principles will enable future development and expansion of virus taxonomy as the true evolutionary diversity of viruses becomes apparent.
