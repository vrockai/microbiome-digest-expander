## Staphylococcus epidermidis and its dual lifestyle in skin health and infection.
 31.08.2022, _MM Severn, AR Horswill_


The coagulase-negative bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis is a member of the human skin microbiota. S. epidermidis is not merely a passive resident on skin but actively primes the cutaneous immune response, maintains skin homeostasis and prevents opportunistic pathogens from causing disease via colonization resistance. However, it is now appreciated that S. epidermidis and its interactions with the host exist on a spectrum of potential pathogenicity derived from its high strain-level heterogeneity. S. epidermidis is the most common cause of implant-associated infections and is a canonical opportunistic biofilm former. Additional emerging evidence suggests that some strains of S. epidermidis may contribute to the pathogenesis of common skin diseases. Here, we highlight new developments in our understanding of S. epidermidis strain diversity, skin colonization dynamics and its multifaceted interactions with the host and other members of the skin microbiota.

## Antimicrobial peptide production in response to gut microbiota imbalance.
 29.08.2022, _MH Cardoso, BT Meneguetti, NG Oliveira-JÃºnior, MLR Macedo, OL Franco_


The gut microbiota presents essential functions in the immune response. The gut epithelium acts as a protective barrier and, therefore, can produce several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that can act against pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria. Several factors cause a disturbance in gut microbiota, including the exacerbated and erroneous use of antibiotics. Antibiotic therapy has been closely related to bacterial resistance and is also correlated with undesired side-effects to the host, including the eradication of commensal bacteria. Consequently, this results in gut microbiota imbalance and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) development. In this context, AMPs in the gut epithelium play a restructuring role for gut microbiota. Some naturally occurring AMPs are selective for pathogenic bacteria, thus preserving the health microbiota. Therefore, AMPs produced by the host's epithelial cells represent effective molecules in treating gut bacterial infections. Bearing this in mind, this review focused on describing the importance of the host's AMPs in gut microbiota modulation and their role as anti-infective agents against pathogenic bacteria.
