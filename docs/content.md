_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Deciphering mechanisms and implications of bacterial translocation in human health and disease.
 26.04.2022, _S Jin, D Wetzel, M Schirmer_


Significant increases in potential microbial translocation, especially along the oral-gut axis, have been identified in many immune-related and inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and liver cirrhosis, for which we currently have no cure or long-term treatment options. Recent advances in computational and experimental omics approaches now enable strain tracking, functional profiling, and strain isolation in unprecedented detail, which has the potential to elucidate the causes and consequences of microbial translocation. In this review, we discuss current evidence for the detection of bacterial translocation, examine different translocation axes with a primary focus on the oral-gut axis, and outline currently known translocation mechanisms and how they adversely affect the host in disease. Finally, we conclude with an overview of state-of-the-art computational and experimental tools for strain tracking and highlight the required next steps to elucidate the role of bacterial translocation in human health.
