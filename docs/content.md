Culturomics is a high-throughput culture approach that has dramatically contributed to the recent renewal of culture. While metagenomics enabled substantial advances in exploring the microbiota, culturomics significantly expanded our knowledge regarding the bacterial gut repertoire through the discovery and the description of hundreds of new taxa. While this approach relies on the variation of culture conditions and media, we have tested so far more than 300 conditions since the beginning of culturomics studies. In this context, we aimed herein to identify the most profitable conditions for optimizing culturomics approach. For this purpose, we have analysed a set of 58 culturomics conditions that were previously applied to 8 faecal specimens, enabling the isolation of 497 bacterial species. As a result, we were able to reduce the number of conditions used to isolate these 497 of more than a half (i.e. to 25 culture conditions). We have also established a list of the 16 conditions that allowed to capture 98% of the total number of species previously isolated. These data constitute a methodological starting point for culture-based microbiota studies by improving the culturomics workflow without any loss of captured bacterial diversity.

## The microbiome of diabetic foot ulcers: a comparison of swab and tissue biopsy wound sampling techniques using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
 19.06.2020, _J Travis, M Malone, H Hu, A Baten, K Johani, F Huygens, K Vickery, K Benkendorff_


Health-care professionals need to collect wound samples to identify potential pathogens that contribute to wound infection. Obtaining appropriate samples from diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) where there is a suspicion of infection is of high importance. Paired swabs and tissue biopsies were collected from DFUs and both sampling techniques were compared using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

## Revealing links between gut microbiome and its fungal community in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among Emirati subjects: A pilot study.
 19.06.2020, _MT Al Bataineh, NR Dash, PB Lassen, BH Banimfreg, AM Nada, E Belda, K Clément_


Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) drastically affects the population of Middle East countries with an ever-increasing number of overweight and obese individuals. The precise links between T2DM and gut microbiome composition remain elusive in these populations. Here, we performed 16 S rRNA and ITS2- gene based microbial profiling of 50 stool samples from Emirati adults with or without T2DM. The four major enterotypes initially described in westernized cohorts were retrieved in this Emirati population. T2DM and non-T2DM healthy controls had different microbiome compositions, with an enrichment in Prevotella enterotype in non-T2DM controls whereas T2DM individuals had a higher proportion of the dysbiotic Bacteroides 2 enterotype. No significant differences in microbial diversity were observed in T2DM individuals after controlling for cofounding factors, contrasting with reports from westernized cohorts. Interestingly, fungal diversity was significantly decreased in Bacteroides 2 enterotype. Functional profiling from 16 S rRNA gene data showed marked differences between T2DM and non-T2DM controls, with an enrichment in amino acid degradation and LPS-related modules in T2DM individuals, whereas non-T2DM controls had increased abundance of carbohydrate degradation modules in concordance with enterotype composition. These differences provide an insight into gut microbiome composition in Emirati population and its potential role in the development of diabetes mellitus.

## Alterations in the Gut Microbiome in the Progression of Cirrhosis to Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
 17.06.2020, _Y Lapidot, A Amir, R Nosenko, A Uzan-Yulzari, E Veitsman, O Cohen-Ezra, Y Davidov, P Weiss, T Bradichevski, S Segev, O Koren, M Safran, Z Ben-Ari_


Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While cirrhosis is the main risk factor for HCC, the factors influencing progression from cirrhosis to HCC remain largely unknown. Gut microbiota plays a key role in liver diseases; however, its association with HCC remains elusive. This study aimed to elucidate microbial differences between patients with HCC-associated cirrhosis (HCC-cirrhosis) and cirrhotic patients without HCC and healthy volunteers and to explore the associations between diet, lifestyle, and the microbiome of these patients. Fecal samples and food frequency questionnaires were collected from 95 individuals (30 HCC-cirrhosis patients, 38 cirrhotic patients without HCC, and 27 age- and body mass index [BMI]-matched healthy volunteers). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed. Bacterial richness in cirrhosis and HCC-cirrhosis patients was significantly lower than in healthy controls. The HCC-cirrhosis group was successfully classified with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9 based on the dysbiotic fecal microbial signature. The HCC-cirrhosis group had a significant overrepresentation of Clostridium and CF231 and reduced Alphaproteobacteria abundance compared to cirrhotic patients without HCC. Patients with HCC-cirrhosis who were overweight displayed significantly decreased bacterial richness and altered microbiota composition compared to their normal-weight counterparts. There was a significant correlation in the HCC-cirrhosis group between intake of artificial sweeteners and the presence of Akkermansia muciniphila A unique microbial signature was observed in patients with HCC-cirrhosis, irrespective of cirrhosis stage, diet, or treatment. BMI, dietary sugar, and artificial sweeteners were significantly associated with alterations in the microbiome of HCC-cirrhosis patients. However, the increased abundance of Clostridium and CF231 observed in HCC-cirrhosis patients was not influenced by environmental factors, implying that this change was due to development of HCC.IMPORTANCE Development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis is associated with alterations in intestinal microbiota, including an escalation of dysbiosis and reduced bacterial richness. This study demonstrates that reduced bacterial richness and dysbiosis escalate with the progression of cirrhosis from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis and to HCC-associated cirrhosis (HCC-cirrhosis). Moreover, we report for the first time the effect of environmental factors on HCC-cirrhosis. Excess weight was associated with increased dysbiosis in patients with HCC compared to their normal-weight counterparts. Moreover, fatty liver, consumption of artificial sweeteners, and high-sugar foods were associated with altered microbial composition, including altered levels of Akkermansia muciniphila in HCC-cirrhosis. We have successfully determined that levels of Alphaproteobacteria and the two genera CF231 and Clostridium are significantly altered in cirrhotic patients who develop hepatocellular carcinoma, independently of cirrhosis severity and dietary habits.

## Taxonomic diversity of sputum microbiome in lung cancer patients and its relationship with chromosomal aberrations in blood lymphocytes.
 19.06.2020, _VG Druzhinin, LV Matskova, PS Demenkov, ED Baranova, VP Volobaev, VI Minina, SV Apalko, MA Churina, SA Romanyuk, SG Shcherbak, VI Ivanov, AV Larionov_


Here we report a pilot-sized study to compare the taxonomic composition of sputum microbiome in 17 newly-diagnosed lung cancer (LC) patients and 17 controls. Another object was to compare the representation of individual bacterial genera and species in sputum with the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in the blood lymphocytes of LC patients and in controls. Both groups were male; average age 56.1 ± 11.5 in patients and 55.7 ± 4.1 in controls. Differences in the species composition of bacterial communities in LC patients and controls were significant (pseudo-F = 1.94; p = 0.005). Increased prevalence in LC patients was detected for the genera Haemophilus and Bergeyella; whereas a decrease was observed for the genera Atopobium, Stomatobaculum, Treponema and Porphyromonas. Donors with high frequencies of chromosomal aberrations had a significant reduction in the microbiome of representatives of the genus Atopobium in the microbiome and a simultaneous increase in representatives of the species Alloprevotella compared to donors with a low level of chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes. Thus, a comparison of the bacterial composition in the sputum of donors with cytogenetic damages in theirs lymphocytes, warrants further investigations on the potential role of microorganisms in the process of mutagenesis in somatic cells of the host body.

## Human milk microbiota development during lactation and its relation to maternal geographic location and gestational hypertensive status.
 16.06.2020, _Y Wan, J Jiang, M Lu, W Tong, R Zhou, J Li, J Yuan, F Wang, D Li_


Bacteria in human milk could directly seed the infant intestinal microbiota, while information about how milk microbiota develops during lactation and how geographic location, gestational hypertensive status, and maternal age influence this process is limited. Here, we collected human milk samples from mothers of term infants at the first day, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks postpartum from 117 longitudinally followed-up mothers (age: 28.7 ± 3.6 y) recruited from three cities in China. We found that milk microbial diversity and richness were the highest in colostrum but gradually decreased over lactation. Microbial composition changed across lactation and exhibited more discrete compositional patterns in 2-week and 6-week milk samples compared with colostrum samples. At phylum level, the abundance of Proteobacteria increased during lactation, while Firmicutes showed the opposite trend. At genus level, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Lactobacillus were predominant in colostrum samples and showed distinct variations across lactation. Maternal geographic location was significantly associated with the milk microbiota development and the abundance of predominant genus. In addition, milk from mothers with gestational prehypertension had a different and less diverse microbial community at genus level in early lactation times, and contained less Lactobacillus in the 2-week milk samples than those from normotensive mothers. Findings of our study outlined the human milk microbial diversity and community development over lactation, and underscored the importance of maternal geographic locations and gestational hypertensive status on milk microbiota, which might have important implications in the establishment of the infant intestinal microbiota via breastfeeding.

## Maternal Microbiota, Cortisol Concentration, and Post-Partum Weight Recovery are Dependent on Mode of Delivery.
 18.06.2020, _M Selma-Royo, I García-Mantrana, M Calatayud, A Parra-Llorca, C Martínez-Costa, MC Collado_


The importance of the maternal microbiota in terms of the initial bacterial seeding has previously been highlighted; however, little is currently known about the perinatal factors that could affect it. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of various delivery-related factors on the intestinal microbiome at delivery time and on post-partum weight retention. Data were collected from mothers (n = 167) during the first four months post-partum. A subset of 100 mothers were selected for the determination of the salivary cortisol concentration and microbiome composition at birth by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The maternal microbiota was classified into two distinct clusters with significant differences in microbial composition and diversity. Maternal microbiota was also significantly influenced by the mode of delivery. Moreover, the salivary cortisol concentration was associated with some maternal microbiota genera and it was significantly higher in the vaginal delivery group (p = 0.003). The vaginal delivery group exhibited lower post-partum weight retention than the C-section (CS) mothers at four months post-partum (p &lt; 0.001). These results support the hypothesis that the mode of delivery as well as the codominant hormonal changes could influence the maternal microbiota and possibly impact maternal weight recovery during the post-partum period.

Recent advances in the next-generation sequencing (NGS) allowed the metagenomic analyses of DNA from many different environments and sources, including thousands of years old skeletal remains. It has been shown that most of the DNA extracted from ancient samples is microbial. There are several reports demonstrating that the considerable fraction of extracted DNA belonged to the bacteria accompanying the studied individuals before their death.

## An Insight into Diversity and Functionalities of Gut Microbiota in Insects.
 14.06.2020, _S Wang, L Wang, X Fan, C Yu, L Feng, L Yi_


The gut microbiota has long been of research interests due to its nutritional importance for many insects. It has been demonstrated that diversity of gut microbiota in insects can be modulated by many factors, including habitats, feeding preference, etc. Besides, the community structure of gut microbiota could also be altered during the different life stages of host insects. With development of conventional culture-dependent technologies and advanced culture-independent technologies, comprehensive and deep understanding of the functions of gut microbiota and their relationship with host insects were achieved, especially for the nutrient metabolic process mediated by them. In this review, we summarized the gut microbiota composition, major methods for gut microbiota characterization, and vital nutrient metabolic process mediated by gut microbiota in different insects. The increasing knowledge on the modulation of gut microbiota will help us for the comprehension of the contribution of gut microbiota to the nutritional metabolism of insects, prompting their growth and health.

## Effects of increasing concentrations of unamended and gypsum modified bauxite residues on soil microbial community functions and structure - A mesocosm study.
 22.06.2020, _C Fourrier, M Luglia, P Hennebert, J Foulon, JP Ambrosi, B Angeletti, C Keller, S Criquet_


Bauxite residues (BR), commonly named red muds, are the saline-sodic waste produced during the extraction of alumina from bauxite. In this study, four kinds of BR were mixed at increasing concentrations with two soils in a mesososm experiment. Unamended BR from Provence (PRO) and Guinea (GUI) bauxite were selected, and Modified Bauxite Residues from PRO and GUI (MBR-PRO and MBR-GUI) were obtained by gypsum application and repeated leaching, in order to reduce their pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). Several indicators of microbial community functions and structure (growth of culturable bacteria; enzymatic activities; C-sourced substrates degradation (Biolog®); bacteria and fungi PCR-RFLP fingerprints) were measured after 35 days of incubation. Results showed that PRO residue had stronger negative effects than GUI on all the tested indicators. Residues modified by gypsum addition (MBR-PRO, MBR-GUI) were equally or sometimes less harmful compared to unamended residues. Microbial activities (bacterial growth and enzyme activities) were more inhibited than the diversity of microbial functions (Biolog®), and the structure of bacterial and fungal communities was not affected by increasing concentrations of bauxite residues. EC and ESP were the main factors explaining the inhibition of microbial activities, although the origin of bauxite residue is of great importance too.

## Microbiome approaches provide the key to biologically control postharvest pathogens and storability of fruits and vegetables.
 16.06.2020, _P Kusstatscher, T Cernava, A Abdelfattah, J Gokul, L Korsten, G Berg_


Microbes play an important role in plants and interact closely with their host starting from sprouting seeds, continuing during growth, and after harvest. The discovery of their importance for plant and postharvest health initiated a biotechnological development of various antagonistic bacteria and fungi for disease control. Nevertheless, their application often showed inconsistent effects. Recently, high-throughput sequencing-based techniques including advanced microscopy reveal fruits and vegetables as holobionts. At harvest, all fruits and vegetables harbor a highly abundant and specific microbiota including beneficial, pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. Especially, a high microbial diversity and resilient microbial networks were shown to be linked to fruit and vegetable health, while diseased products showed severe dysbioses. Field and postharvest handling of fruits and vegetables was shown to affect the indigenous microbiome and therefore has a substantial impact on the storability of fruits and vegetables. Microbiome tracking can be implemented as a new tool to evaluate and assess all postharvest processes and contribute to fruit and vegetable health. Here we summarize current research advancements in the emerging field of postharvest microbiomes and elaborate its importance. The generated knowledge provides profound insights into postharvest microbiome dynamics and sets a new basis for targeted, microbiome-driven and sustainable control strategies.

## Differential Responses of a Coastal Prokaryotic Community to Phytoplanktonic Organic Matter Derived from Cellular Components and Exudates.
 19.06.2020, _H Takebe, K Tominaga, K Fujiwara, K Yamamoto, T Yoshida_


The phytoplanktonic production and prokaryotic consumption of organic matter significantly contribute to marine carbon cycling. Organic matter released from phytoplankton via three processes (exudation of living cells, cell disruption through grazing, and viral lysis) shows distinct chemical properties. We herein investigated the effects of phytoplanktonic whole-cell fractions (WF) (representing cell disruption by grazing) and extracellular fractions (EF) (representing exudates) prepared from Heterosigma akashiwo, a bloom-forming Raphidophyceae, on prokaryotic communities using culture-based experiments. We analyzed prokaryotic community changes for two weeks. The shift in cell abundance by both treatments showed similar dynamics, reaching the first peak (~4.1×106‍ ‍cells‍ ‍mL-1) on day 3 and second peak (~1.1×106‍ ‍cells‍ ‍mL-1) on day 13. We classified the sequences obtained into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis revealed that the OTU-level community structure changed distinctively with the two treatments. Ten and 13 OTUs were specifically abundant in the WF and EF treatments, respectively. These OTUs were assigned as heterotrophic bacteria mainly belonging to the Alteromonadales (Gammaproteobacteria) and Bacteroidetes clades and showed successive dynamics following the addition of organic matter. We also analyzed the dynamics of these OTUs in the ocean using publicly available metagenomic data from a natural coastal bloom in Monterey Bay, USA. At least two WF treatment OTUs showed co-occurrence with H. akashiwo, indicating that the blooms of H. akashiwo also affect these OTUs in the ocean. The present results strongly suggest that the thriving and dead cells of uninfected phytoplankton differentially influence the marine prokaryotic community.

## Microorganisms populating the water-related indoor biome.
 13.06.2020, _M Novak Babič, C Gostinčar, N Gunde-Cimerman_


Modernisation of our households created novel opportunities for microbial growth and thus changed the array of microorganisms we come in contact with. While many studies have investigated microorganisms in the air and dust, tap water, another major input of microbial propagules, has received far less attention. The quality of drinking water in developed world is strictly regulated to prevent immediate danger to human health. However, fungi, algae, protists and bacteria of less immediate concern are usually not screened for. These organisms can thus use water as a vector of transmission into the households, especially if they are resistant to various water treatment procedures. Good tolerance of unfavourable abiotic conditions is also important for survival once microbes enter the household. Limitation of water availability, high or low temperatures, application of antimicrobial chemicals and other measures are taken to prevent indoor microbial overgrowth. These conditions, together with a large number of novel chemicals in our homes, shape the diversity and abundance of indoor microbiota through constant selection of the most resilient species, resulting in a substantial overlap in diversity of indoor and natural extreme environments. At least in fungi, extremotolerance has been linked to human pathogenicity, explaining why many species found in novel indoor habitats (such as dishwasher) are notable opportunistic pathogens. As a result, microorganisms that often enter our households with water and are then enriched in novel indoor habitats might have a hitherto underestimated impact on the well-being of the increasingly indoor-bound human population. KEY POINTS: Domestic environment harbours a large diversity of microorganisms. Microbiota of water-related indoor habitats mainly originates from tap water. Bathrooms, kitchens and household appliances select for polyextremotolerant species. Many household-related microorganisms are human opportunistic pathogens.
