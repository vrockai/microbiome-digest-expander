Inquiry of microbiota involvement in kidney stone disease (KSD) has largely focussed on potential oxalate handling abilities by gut bacteria and the increased association with antibiotic exposure. By systematically comparing the gut, urinary, and oral microbiota of 83 stone formers (SF) and 30 healthy controls (HC), we provide a unified assessment of the bacterial contribution to KSD.

## Culturing the unculturables: strategies, challenges, and opportunities for gut microbiome study.
 25.11.2023, _A Yadav, S Ahlawat, KK Sharma_


Metagenome sequencing techniques revolutionized the field of gut microbiome study. However, it is equipped with experimental and computational biases which affect the downstream analysis results. Also, live microbial strains is needed for a better understanding of host-microbial crosstalks and for designing next-generation treatment therapies based on probiotic strains and postbiotic molecules. Conventional culturing methodologies are insufficient to get the dark gut matter on the plate; therefore, there is an urgent need to propose novel culturing methods that can fill the limitations of metagenomic. The current work aims to provide a consolidated evaluation of the available methods for host-microbe interaction with an emphasis on in vitro culturing of gut microbes using organoids, gut on a chip, and gut bioreactor. Further, the knowledge of microbial crosstalk in the gut helps us to identify core microbiota, and key metabolites that will aid in designing culturing media and co-culturing systems for gut microbiome study. After the deeper mining of the current culturing methods, we recommend that 3-D printed intestinal cells in a multistage continuous flow reactor equipped with an extended organoid system might be a good practical choice for gut microbiota-based studies.

## Trans-vaccenic acid reprograms CD8+ T cells and anti-tumour immunity.

Diet-derived nutrients are inextricably linked to human physiology by providing energy and biosynthetic building blocks and by functioning as regulatory molecules. However, the mechanisms by which circulating nutrients in the human body influence specific physiological processes remain largely unknown. Here we use a blood nutrient compound library-based screening approach to demonstrate that dietary trans-vaccenic acid (TVA) directly promotes effector CD8+ T cell function and anti-tumour immunity in vivo. TVA is the predominant form of trans-fatty acids enriched in human milk, but the human body cannot produce TVA endogenously1. Circulating TVA in humans is mainly from ruminant-derived foods including beef, lamb and dairy products such as milk and butter2,3, but only around 19% or 12% of dietary TVA is converted to rumenic acid by humans or mice, respectively4,5. Mechanistically, TVA inactivates the cell-surface receptor GPR43, an immunomodulatory G protein-coupled receptor activated by its short-chain fatty acid ligands6-8. TVA thus antagonizes the short-chain fatty acid agonists of GPR43, leading to activation of the cAMP-PKA-CREB axis for enhanced CD8+ T cell function. These findings reveal that diet-derived TVA represents a mechanism for host-extrinsic reprogramming of CD8+ T cells as opposed to the intrahost gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids. TVA thus has translational potential for the treatment of tumours.
