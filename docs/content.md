This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## The bladder neck preservation in robot assisted radical prostatectomy: Surgical and pathological outcome.
 09.01.2024, _M Zazzara, MP Gardiman, F Dal Moro_


The post-prostatectomy incontinence is influenced by multiple elements, anatomic components and biological factors. The bladder neck preservation, more accurate during robot assisted radical prostatectomy, works on two anatomic components responsible for post-prostatectomy continence. The bladder neck preservation spares the internal sphincter, which is responsible for passive continence, and results in earlier return to continence and lower rates of post-prostatectomy incontinence. Moreover, this surgical technique spares the zone of urothelium coaptation and provides primary resistance to the urine to maintain postprostatectomy continence. The potential risk of bladder neck positive surgical margins (PSM) may prevent the usage of the bladder neck preservation.

## Characterization and Antioxidant Activity of the Polysaccharide Hydrolysate from Lactobacillus plantarum LPC-1 and Their Effect on Spinach (Spinach oleracea L.) Growth.
 09.01.2024, _ZX Yan, M Li, HY Wei, SY Peng, DJ Xu, B Zhang, X Cheng_


This study presents a comparison between two hydrolysis systems (MnO2/H2O2 and ascorbic acid (VC)/H2O2) for the depolymerization of exopolysaccharide (EPS) from Lactobacillus plantarum LPC-1. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize these two degradation systems, resulting in two H2O2-free degradation products, MEPS (MnO2/H2O2-treated EPS) and VEPS (VC/H2O2-treated EPS), where H2O2 residues in the final products and their antioxidant activity were considered vital points. The relationship between the structural variations of two degraded polysaccharides and their antioxidant activity was characterized. Physicochemical tests showed that H2O2 had a notable impact on determining the total and reducing sugars in the polysaccharides, and both degradation systems efficiently eliminated this effect. After optimization, the average molecular weight of EPS was reduced from 265.75 kDa to 135.41 kDa (MEPS) and 113.11 kDa (VEPS), improving its antioxidant properties. Characterization results showed that the two hydrolysis products had similar major functional groups and monosaccharide composition as EPS. The crystal structure, main chain length, and branched chain number were crucial factors affecting the biological activity of polysaccharides. In pot testing, two degraded polysaccharides improved spinach quality more than EPS due to their lower molecular weights, suggesting the advantages of low-molecular-weight polysaccharides. In summary, these two degradation techniques offer valuable insights for further expanding the utilization of microbial resources.

Metabolism of haem by-products such as bilirubin by humans and their gut microbiota is essential to human health, as excess serum bilirubin can cause jaundice and even neurological damage. The bacterial enzymes that reduce bilirubin to urobilinogen, a key step in this pathway, have remained unidentified. Here we used biochemical analyses and comparative genomics to identify BilR as a gut-microbiota-derived bilirubin reductase that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen. We delineated the BilR sequences from similar reductases through the identification of key residues critical for bilirubin reduction and found that BilR is predominantly encoded by Firmicutes species. Analysis of human gut metagenomes revealed that BilR is nearly ubiquitous in healthy adults, but prevalence is decreased in neonates and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. This discovery sheds light on the role of the gut microbiome in bilirubin metabolism and highlights the significance of the gut-liver axis in maintaining bilirubin homeostasis.

Establishing the infant's gut microbiota has long-term implications on health and immunity. Breastfeeding is recognized as the best practice of infant nutrition in comparison with formula feeding. We evaluated the effects of the primary feeding practices by analyzing the infant growth and the potential association with gut diseases. A cross-sectional and observational study was designed. This study included 55 mothers with infants, who were divided according to their feeding practices in breastfeeding (BF), formula feeding (FF), and combined breast and formula feeding (CF). Anthropometric measurements of the participants were recorded. Additionally, non-invasive fecal samples from the infants were collected to analyze the microbiota by sequencing, immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration (ELISA), and volatile organic compounds (gas chromatography with an electronic nose). Results showed that the microbiota diversity in the BF group was the highest compared to the other two groups. The IgA levels in the BF group were twice as high as those in the FF group. Moreover, the child´s growth in the BF group showed the best infant development when the data were compared at birth to the recollection time, as noted by the correlation with a decreased concentration of toxic volatile organic compounds. Interestingly, the CF group showed a significant difference in health status when the data were compared with the FF group. We conclude that early health practices influence children's growth, which is relevant to further research about how those infants' health evolved.

Aquaculture plays an important role in global protein supplies and food security. The ban on antibiotics as feed additive proposes urgent need to develop alternatives. Gut microbiota plays important roles in the metabolism and immunity of fish and has the potential to give rise to novel solutions for challenges confronted by fish culture. However, our understanding of fish gut microbiome is still lacking.

The observation that the intestinal microbiota is central in the development of IBD suggests that dietary fiber, the microbiota's primary source of nourishment, could play a central role in these diseases. Accordingly, enriching diets with specific soluble fibers remodels microbiota and modulates colitis sensitivity. In humans, a recent study suggests that the microbiota of select IBD patients might influence the impacts they would experience upon fiber exposure. We sought here to define the extent to which individual microbiotas varied in their responsiveness to purified soluble fiber inulin and psyllium. Moreover, the extent to which such variance might impact proneness to colitis.

The anaerobic digestion process degrades organic matter into simpler compounds and occurs in strictly anaerobic and microaerophilic environments. The process is carried out by a diverse community of microorganisms where each species has a unique role and it has relevant biotechnological applications since it is used for biogas production. Some aspects of the microbiome, including its interaction with phages, remains still unclear: a better comprehension of the community composition and role of each species is crucial for a cured understanding of the carbon cycle in anaerobic systems and improving biogas production.

The objective of this study is to explore the probiotic properties and optimal growth conditions of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum BG24. L. plantarum BG24 exhibited a remarkable ability to utilize lactose, and to grow under acidic conditions and in the presence of high levels of bile salts. The strain showed the highest antibacterial activity against L. monocytogenes Scott A (zone of inhibition: 26 mm). L. plantarum BG24 was found to be resistant to 8 of the tested 19 antibiotics using the disc diffusion method.and its multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index was calculated as 0.421. The adhesion rate to human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells was determined as 37.51%. The enzyme profile of L. plantarum BG24 was investigated using API ZYM test kit and the highest enzymatic activities were found for Leucine arylamidase, β-glucosidase, Valine arylamidase, β-galactosidase and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase. L. plantarum BG24 strain showed higher microbial growth under static conditions (6.60 OD600) compared to 100 rpm (5.73 OD600) and 200 rpm (5.02 OD600) shaking speed due to its facultative anaerobic characteristic. However, different inoculation rates and glucose addition did not make a statistically significant difference on biomass formation (p &gt; 0.05). The specific growth rate of L. plantarum BG24 was 0.416 h-1, the doubling time was 1.67 h, and the biomass productivity value was 0.14 gL-1 h-1 in the original MRS broth (pH 5.7) while higher values were found as 0.483 h-1, 1.43 h and 0.17 gL-1 h-1, respectively, in MRS broth (pH 6.5) medium enriched with 5 g/L yeast extract. The stirred tank bioreactor was used to optimise the growth of BG24 strain. The process variables was optimized at 0.05 vvm of aeration rate, 479 rpm of agitation speed, 3% of inoculation rate and 18 h of incubation time. The maximum biomass (g/L) production was obtained as 3.84 g/L at the optimized conditions.

## Fiber configuration determines foreign body response of electrospun scaffolds: in vitro and in vivo assessments.
 09.01.2024, _Q Ma, X Wang, B Feng, C Liang, X Wan, M El-Newehy, M Moydeen, X Mo, J Wu_


Biomaterial scaffolds boost tissue repair and regeneration by providing physical support, delivering biological signals and/or cells, and recruiting endogenous cells to facilitate tissue-material integration and remodeling. Foreign body response (FBR), an innate immune response that occurs immediately after biomaterial implantation, is a critical factor determining the biological outcomes of biomaterial scaffolds. Electrospinning is of great simplicity and cost-effectiveness to produce nanofiber scaffolds with well-defined physicochemical properties and has been used in a variety of regenerative medicine applications in preclinical trials and clinical practice. A deep understanding of causal factors between material properties and FBR of host tissues is beneficial to the optimal design of electrospun scaffolds with favorable immunomodulatory properties. We herein prepared and characterized three electrospun scaffolds with distinct fiber configurations and investigate their effects on FBR in terms of immune cell-material interactions and host responses. Our results show that electrospun yarn scaffold results in greater cellular immune reaction and elevated FBR in in vivo assessments. Although the yarn scaffold showed aligned fiber bundles, it failed to induce cell elongation of macrophages due to its rough surface and porous grooves between yarns. In contrast, the aligned scaffold showed reduced FRB compared to the yarn scaffold, indicating a smooth surface is also a contributor to the immunomodulative effects of the aligned scaffold. Our study suggests that balanced porousness and smooth surface of aligned fibers or yarns should be the key design parameter of electrospun scaffolds to modulate host response in vivo.

Nanodecoy systems based on analogues of viral cellular receptors assembled onto fluid lipid-based membranes of nano/extravescicles are potential new tools to complement classic therapeutic or preventive antiviral approaches. The need for lipid-based membranes for transmembrane receptor anchorage may pose technical challenges along industrial translation, calling for alternative geometries for receptor multimerization. Here we developed a semisynthetic self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 nanodecoy by multimerizing the biotin labelled virus cell receptor -ACE2- ectodomain onto a poly-avidin nanoparticle (NP) based on the Avidin-Nucleic-Acid-NanoASsembly-ANANAS. The ability of the assembly to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and the affinity of the ACE2:viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction were measured at different ACE2:NP ratios. At ACE2:NP = 30, 90 % SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibition at ACE2 nanomolar concentration was registered on both Wuhan and Omicron variants, with ten-fold higher potency than the monomeric protein. Lower and higher ACE2 densities were less efficient suggesting that functional recognition between multi-ligand NPs and multi-receptor virus surfaces requires optimal geometrical relationships. In vivo studies in mice showed that the biodistribution and safety profiles of the nanodecoy are potentially suitable for preventing viral infection upon nasal instillation. Viral receptor multimerization using ANANAS is a convenient process which, in principle, could be rapidly adapted to counteract also other viral infections.

The rhizosheath, a cohesive soil layer firmly adhering to plant roots, plays a vital role in facilitating water and mineral uptake. In pearl millet, rhizosheath formation is genetically controlled and influenced by root exudates. Here, we investigated the impact of root exudates on the microbiota composition, interactions, and assembly processes, and rhizosheath structure in pearl millet using four distinct lines with contrasting soil aggregation abilities.

Metagenomics has enabled the comprehensive study of microbiomes. However, many applications would benefit from a method that sequences specific bacterial taxa of interest, but not most background taxa. We developed mEnrich-seq (in which 'm' stands for methylation and seq for sequencing) for enriching taxa of interest from metagenomic DNA before sequencing. The core idea is to exploit the self versus nonself differentiation by natural bacterial DNA methylation and rationally choose methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, individually or in combination, to deplete host and background taxa while enriching targeted taxa. This idea is integrated with library preparation procedures and applied in several applications to enrich (up to 117-fold) pathogenic or beneficial bacteria from human urine and fecal samples, including species that are hard to culture or of low abundance. We assessed 4,601 bacterial strains with mapped methylomes so far and showed broad applicability of mEnrich-seq. mEnrich-seq provides microbiome researchers with a versatile and cost-effective approach for selective sequencing of diverse taxa of interest.

Diverse host factors drive microbial variation in plant-associated environments, whereas their genetic mechanisms remain largely unexplored. To address this, we coupled the analyses of plant genetics and microbiomes in this study. Using 100 tea plant (Camellia sinensis) cultivars, the microbiomes of rhizosphere, root endosphere and phyllosphere showed clear compartment-specific assembly, whereas the subpopulation differentiation of tea cultivars exhibited small effects on microbial variation in each compartment. Through microbiome genome-wide association studies, we examined the interactions between tea genetic loci and microbial variation. Notably, genes related to the cell wall and carbon catabolism were heavily linked to root endosphere microbial composition, whereas genes related to the metabolism of metal ions and small organic molecules were overrepresented in association with rhizosphere microbial composition. Moreover, a set of tea genetic variants, including the cytoskeleton-related formin homology interacting protein 1 gene, were strongly associated with the β-diversity of phyllosphere microbiomes, implying their interactions with the overall structure of microbial communities. Our results create a catalogue of tea genetic determinants interacting with microbiomes and reveal the compartment-specific microbiome assembly driven by host genetics.

## Clinical profile, management and risk factors for seizure-related burn injuries among patients with epilepsy in southwest China.
 09.01.2024, _Y Wang, L Luo, H Li, M Li, Y Huang, Y Huang, G Luo, M Liu_


The epidemiological information associated with seizure-related burn injuries is lacking in China. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the clinical profile, management, outcome, and risk factors of burns that are directly caused by seizures among epileptic patients, and identify the epidemiological characteristics to develop effective preventive strategies.
