Although previous studies have suggested a close association between gut microbiota (GM) and intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), the causal relationship between them remains unclear. Hence, we thoroughly investigate their causal relationship by means of a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, aiming to determine the impact of gut microbiota on the risk of developing intervertebral disc degeneration.

## The gut microbiota-brain axis in neurological disorder.
 23.08.2023, _H Ullah, S Arbab, Y Tian, CQ Liu, Y Chen, L Qijie, MIU Khan, IU Hassan, K Li_


The gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in the physiology and pathology of the host. Microbiota communicate with different organs of the organism by synthesizing hormones and regulating body activity. The interaction of the central nervous system (CNS) and gut signaling pathways includes chemical, neural immune and endocrine routes. Alteration or dysbiosis in the gut microbiota leads to different gastrointestinal tract disorders that ultimately impact host physiology because of the abnormal microbial metabolites that stimulate and trigger different physiologic reactions in the host body. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to a change in the bidirectional relationship between the CNS and GM, which is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Increasing preclinical and clinical studies/evidence indicate that gut microbes are a possible susceptibility factor for the progression of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this review, we discuss the crucial connection between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, the signaling pathways of multiple biological systems and the contribution of gut microbiota-related neurological disorders.

## Rosmarinic acid alleviates intestinal inflammatory damage and inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress and smooth muscle contraction abnormalities in intestinal tissues by regulating gut microbiota.
 18.08.2023, _K Li, J Wu, S Xu, X Li, Y Zhang, XJ Gao_


The host-bacterial interactions play the key role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dysbiosis of the intestinal flora can lead to pathological changes in the intestine. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural phenolic acid compound with antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-bacterial activities that has a palliative effect on acute IBD. We have established an in vivo model for mice. Histological staining was performed to directly observe RA alterations in the intestinal tract. The alteration of RA on mouse intestinal flora was observed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, and the effect of RA on intestinal mechanism of action was detected by qPCR and western blot. The results showed that RA had a significant protective effect on the intestine. RA upregulated the abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii and Candidatus Arthromitus sp SFB-mouse-NL and downregulated the abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Escherichia coli, and Romboutsia ilealis. RA downregulated the expressions of ROCK, RhoA, CaM, MLC, MLCK, ZEB1, ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, E-cadherin, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, GRP78, PERK, IRE1, ATF6, CHOP, Caspase12, Caspase9, Caspase3, Bax, Cytc, RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL, and upregulated the expression of IL-10 and Bcl-2. These results displayed that RA inhibited the inflammation, which is caused by tight junction damage, by repairing intestinal flora dysbiosis, relieved endoplasmic reticulum stress, inhibited cell death, and corrected smooth muscle contractile dysregulation. The results of this study revealed RA could have a protective effect on the small intestine of mice by regulating intestinal flora. IMPORTANCE Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing, remitting disorder of the gastrointestinal system. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of rosmarinic acid on the intestinal tract. The results showed that RA was effective in reducing inflammatory damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, smooth muscle contraction abnormalities, and regulating intestinal flora disorders.

## Inter-comparison of marine microbiome sampling protocols.

Research on marine microbial communities is growing, but studies are hard to compare because of variation in seawater sampling protocols. To help researchers in the inter-comparison of studies that use different seawater sampling methodologies, as well as to help them design future sampling campaigns, we developed the EuroMarine Open Science Exploration initiative (EMOSE). Within the EMOSE framework, we sampled thousands of liters of seawater from a single station in the NW Mediterranean Sea (Service d'Observation du Laboratoire Arago [SOLA], Banyuls-sur-Mer), during one single day. The resulting dataset includes multiple seawater processing approaches, encompassing different material-type kinds of filters (cartridge membrane and flat membrane), three different size fractionations (&gt;0.22 µm, 0.22-3 µm, 3-20 µm and &gt;20 µm), and a number of different seawater volumes ranging from 1 L up to 1000 L. We show that the volume of seawater that is filtered does not have a significant effect on prokaryotic and protist diversity, independently of the sequencing strategy. However, there was a clear difference in alpha and beta diversity between size fractions and between these and "whole water" (with no pre-fractionation). Overall, we recommend care when merging data from datasets that use filters of different pore size, but we consider that the type of filter and volume should not act as confounding variables for the tested sequencing strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a publicly available dataset effectively allows for the clarification of the impact of marine microbiome methodological options across a wide range of protocols, including large-scale variations in sampled volume.

## MT-MAG: Accurate and interpretable machine learning for complete or partial taxonomic assignments of metagenomeassembled genomes.
 23.08.2023, _W Li, L Kari, Y Yu, LA Hug_

We propose MT-MAG, a novel machine learning-based software tool for the complete or partial hierarchically-structured taxonomic classification of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). MT-MAG is alignment-free, with k-mer frequencies being the only feature used to distinguish a DNA sequence from another (herein k = 7). MT-MAG is capable of classifying large and diverse metagenomic datasets: a total of 245.68 Gbp in the training sets, and 9.6 Gbp in the test sets analyzed in this study. In addition to complete classifications, MT-MAG offers a "partial classification" option, whereby a classification at a higher taxonomic level is provided for MAGs that cannot be classified to the Species level. MT-MAG outputs complete or partial classification paths, and interpretable numerical classification confidences of its classifications, at all taxonomic ranks. To assess the performance of MT-MAG, we define a "weighted classification accuracy," with a weighting scheme reflecting the fact that partial classifications at different ranks are not equally informative. For the two benchmarking datasets analyzed (genomes from human gut microbiome species, and bacterial and archaeal genomes assembled from cow rumen metagenomic sequences), MT-MAG achieves an average of 87.32% in weighted classification accuracy. At the Species level, MT-MAG outperforms DeepMicrobes, the only other comparable software tool, by an average of 34.79% in weighted classification accuracy. In addition, MT-MAG is able to completely classify an average of 67.70% of the sequences at the Species level, compared with DeepMicrobes which only classifies 47.45%. Moreover, MT-MAG provides additional information for sequences that it could not classify at the Species level, resulting in the partial or complete classification of 95.13%, of the genomes in the datasets analyzed. Lastly, unlike other taxonomic assignment tools (e.g., GDTB-Tk), MT-MAG is an alignment-free and genetic marker-free tool, able to provide additional bioinformatics analysis to confirm existing or tentative taxonomic assignments.

_Humans, Metagenome, Microbiota, Algorithms, Biological Evolution, Diarrhea_
Exploring metagenomic contigs and "binning" them into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) are essential for the delineation of functional and evolutionary guilds within microbial communities. Despite the advances in automated binning algorithms, their capabilities in recovering MAGs with accuracy and biological relevance are so far limited. Researchers often find that human involvement is necessary to achieve representative binning results. This manual process however is expertise demanding and labor intensive, and it deserves to be supported by software infrastructure.

## Detection of viable commensal bacteria in murine melanoma tumors by culturomics.
 14.08.2023, _CM Phelps, JH Shapira, CR Laughlin, M Meisel_


Emerging evidence suggests the tumor microbiome at gut-distal sites can modulate tumor immunity and response to cancer immunotherapy. However, detection of commensal bacteria at gut-distal tumor sites is challenging given their low abundance. Here, we present a culturomics approach to facilitate recovery of phylogenetically diverse live commensal bacteria within gut-distal melanoma tumors. We describe steps for media preparation, tissue isolation, tissue homogenization, and host cell lysis. We then detail broth expansion culture followed by agar culture and single-colony 16S rRNA sequencing. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Bender and McPherson et al. (2023).1.
