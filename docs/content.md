Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a novel concept proposed in 2020, which is more practical for identifying patients with fatty liver disease with high risk of disease progression. Fatty liver is a driver for extrahepatic complications, particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Although the risk of CVD in MAFLD could be predicted by carotid ultrasound test, a very early stage prediction method before the formation of pathological damage is still lacking.

Diabetes is a predominant driver of coronary artery disease worldwide. This study aims to unravel the distinct characteristics of oral and gut microbiota in diabetic coronary heart disease (DCHD). Simultaneously, we aim to establish a causal link between the diabetes-driven oral-gut microbiota axis and increased susceptibility to diabetic myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI).

The oral cavity is home to various ecological niches, each with its own unique microbial composition. Understanding the microbial communities and gene composition in different ecological niches within the oral cavity of oral cancer (OC) patients is crucial for determining how these microbial populations contribute to disease progression.

## Investigating the causal role of the gut microbiota in esophageal cancer and its subtypes: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.

Through research on the gut microbiota (GM), increasing evidence has indicated that the GM is associated with esophageal cancer (ESCA). However, the specific cause-and-effect relationship remains unclear. In this study, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was applied to investigate the causal relationship between the GM and ESCA, including its subtypes.

## Gut bacteria-driven homovanillic acid alleviates depression by modulating synaptic integrity.
 06.04.2024, _M Zhao, Z Ren, A Zhao, Y Tang, J Kuang, M Li, T Chen, S Wang, J Wang, H Zhang, J Wang, T Zhang, J Zeng, X Liu, G Xie, P Liu, N Sun, T Bao, T Nie, J Lin, P Liu, Y Zheng, X Zheng, T Liu, W Jia_


The gut-brain axis is implicated in depression development, yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. We observed depleted gut bacterial species, including Bifidobacterium longum and Roseburia intestinalis, and the neurotransmitter homovanillic acid (HVA) in individuals with depression and mouse depression models. Although R. intestinalis does not directly produce HVA, it enhances B. longum abundance, leading to HVA generation. This highlights a synergistic interaction among gut microbiota in regulating intestinal neurotransmitter production. Administering HVA, B. longum, or R. intestinalis to mouse models with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression significantly improved depressive symptoms. Mechanistically, HVA inhibited synaptic autophagic death by preventing excessive degradation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and SQSTM1/p62 proteins, protecting hippocampal neurons' presynaptic membrane. These findings underscore the role of the gut microbial metabolism in modulating synaptic integrity and provide insights into potential novel treatment strategies for depression.

## Stress-induced mucin 13 reductions drive intestinal microbiome shifts and despair behaviors.

Depression is a prevalent psychological condition with limited treatment options. While its etiology is multifactorial, both chronic stress and changes in microbiome composition are associated with disease pathology. Stress is known to induce microbiome dysbiosis, defined here as a change in microbial composition associated with a pathological condition. This state of dysbiosis is known to feedback on depressive symptoms. While studies have demonstrated that targeted restoration of the microbiome can alleviate depressive-like symptoms in mice, translating these findings to human patients has proven challenging due to the complexity of the human microbiome. As such, there is an urgent need to identify factors upstream of microbial dysbiosis. Here we investigate the role of mucin 13 as an upstream mediator of microbiome composition changes in the context of stress. Using a model of chronic stress, we show that the glycocalyx protein, mucin 13, is selectively reduced after psychological stress exposure. We further demonstrate that the reduction of Muc13 is mediated by the Hnf4 transcription factor family. Finally, we determine that deleting Muc13 is sufficient to drive microbiome shifts and despair behaviors. These findings shed light on the mechanisms behind stress-induced microbial changes and reveal a novel regulator of mucin 13 expression.
