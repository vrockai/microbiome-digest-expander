## The interaction between microbiome and host central nervous system: the gut-brain axis as a potential new therapeutic target in the treatment of obesity and cardiometabolic disease.

The role of the intestinal microbiota in host cardiometabolic health and disease has gained significant attention over recent decades. Previous studies have shown effects on metabolic health through gut microbiota modulation; this suggests diverse interaction pathways that constitute the communication between gut microbiota and host central nervous system, the so-called gut-brain axis.
