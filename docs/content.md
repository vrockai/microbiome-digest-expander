## A newly identified protein from Akkermansia muciniphila stimulates GLP-1 secretion.
 02.06.2021, _PD Cani, C Knauf_


Akkermansia muciniphila is a gut commensal known to improve host metabolism. The outer membrane protein Amuc_1100 has been shown to partially replicate these beneficial effects. Here, Yoon et al. (2021) have identified a novel protein (P9) secreted by A. muciniphila that stimulates GLP-1 secretion, thereby adding new insight to the biomolecule era to treat metabolic diseases.

## Dispersal strategies shape persistence and evolution of human gut bacteria.
 10.06.2021, _F Hildebrand, TI Gossmann, C Frioux, E Özkurt, PN Myers, P Ferretti, M Kuhn, M Bahram, HB Nielsen, P Bork_


Human gut bacterial strains can co-exist with their hosts for decades, but little is known about how these microbes persist and disperse, and evolve thereby. Here, we examined these processes in 5,278 adult and infant fecal metagenomes, longitudinally sampled in individuals and families. Our analyses revealed that a subset of gut species is extremely persistent in individuals, families, and geographic regions, represented often by locally successful strains of the phylum Bacteroidota. These "tenacious" bacteria show high levels of genetic adaptation to the human host but a high probability of loss upon antibiotic interventions. By contrast, heredipersistent bacteria, notably Firmicutes, often rely on dispersal strategies with weak phylogeographic patterns but strong family transmissions, likely related to sporulation. These analyses describe how different dispersal strategies can lead to the long-term persistence of human gut microbes with implications for gut flora modulations.

## Urinary Microbiome: Yin and Yang of the Urinary Tract.
 01.07.2021, _V Perez-Carrasco, A Soriano-Lerma, M Soriano, J Gutiérrez-Fernández, JA Garcia-Salcedo_


The application of next generation sequencing techniques has allowed the characterization of the urinary tract microbiome and has led to the rejection of the pre-established concept of sterility in the urinary bladder. Not only have microbial communities in the urinary tract been implicated in the maintenance of health but alterations in their composition have also been associated with different urinary pathologies, such as urinary tract infections (UTI). Therefore, the study of the urinary microbiome in healthy individuals, as well as its involvement in disease through the proliferation of opportunistic pathogens, could open a potential field of study, leading to new insights into prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies for urinary pathologies. In this review we present an overview of the current state of knowledge about the urinary microbiome in health and disease, as well as its involvement in the development of new therapeutic strategies.

## Life History Recorded in the Vagino-cervical Microbiome Along with Multi-omics.
 12.06.2021, _Z Jie, C Chen, L Hao, F Li, L Song, X Zhang, J Zhu, L Tian, X Tong, K Cai, Z Zhang, Y Ju, X Yu, Y Li, H Zhou, H Lu, X Qiu, Q Li, Y Liao, D Zhou, H Lian, Y Zuo, X Chen, W Rao, Y Ren, Y Wang, J Zi, R Wang, N Liu, J Wu, W Zhang, X Liu, Y Zong, W Liu, L Xiao, Y Hou, X Xu, H Yang, J Wang, K Kristiansen, H Jia_


The vagina contains at least a billion microbial cells, dominated by lactobacilli. Here we perform metagenomic shotgun sequencing on cervical and fecal samples from a cohort of 516 Chinese women of reproductive age, and cervical, fecal, and salivary samples from a second cohort of 632 women. Factors such as pregnancy, delivery histories, cesarean section, and breast-feeding were all more important than menstrual cycle in shaping the microbiome, and such information would be necessary before trying to interpret differences between vagino-cervical microbiome data. Greater proportion of Bifidobacterium breve was seen with older age at sexual debut. The relative abundance of lactobacilli especially Lactobacillus crispatus was negatively associated with pregnancy history. Potential markers for lack of menstrual regularity, heavy flow, dysmenorrhea, and contraceptives were also identified. Lactobacilli were rare during breast-feeding or post-menopause. Other features such as mood fluctuations and facial speckles could potentially be predicted from the vagino-cervical microbiome. Gut and salivary microbiome, plasma vitamins, metals, amino acids, and hormones showed associations with the vagino-cervical microbiome. Our results offer an unprecedented glimpse into the microbiota of the female reproductive tract and call for international collaborations to better understand its long-term health impact other than in the settings of infection or pre-term birth.

## Predictive functional analysis reveals inferred features unique to cervicovaginal microbiota of African women with bacterial vaginosis and high-risk human papillomavirus infection.
 30.06.2021, _H Onywera, J Anejo-Okopi, LM Mwapagha, J Okendo, AL Williamson_


Mounting evidence suggests that Lactobacillus species may not necessarily be the sine qua non of healthy cervicovaginal microbiota (CVM), especially among reproductive-age African women. A majority of African women have high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM whose bacterial functions remain poorly characterized. Functional profiling of the CVM is vital for investigating human host-microbiota interactions in health and disease. Here, we investigated the functional potential of L. iners-dominated and high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM of 75 African women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV) and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. Functional contents were predicted using PICRUSt. Microbial taxonomic diversity, BV, and HR-HPV infection statuses were correlated with the inferred functional composition of the CVM. Differentially abundant inferred functional categories were identified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) (p-value &lt;0.05 and logarithmic LDA score &gt;2.0). Of the 75 women, 56 (74.7%), 35 (46.7%), and 29 (38.7%) had high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM, BV, and HR-HPV infection, respectively. Alpha diversity of the inferred functional contents (as measured by Shannon diversity index) was significantly higher in women with high-diversity non-Lactobacillus-dominated CVM and BV than their respective counterparts (H statistic ≥11.5, q-value &lt;0.001). Ordination of the predicted functional metagenome content (using Bray-Curtis distances) showed that the samples segregated according to the extent of microbial taxonomic diversity and BV (pseudo-F statistic ≥19.6, q-value = 0.001) but not HR-HPV status (pseudo-F statistic = 1.7, q-value = 0.159). LEfSe analysis of the inferred functional categories revealed that transport systems (including ABC transporters) and transcription factors were enriched in high-diversity CVM. Interestingly, transcription factors and sporulation functional categories were uniquely associated with high-diversity CVM, BV, and HR-HPV infection. Our predictive functional analysis reveals features unique to high-diversity CVM, BV and HR-HPV infections. Such features may represent important biomarkers of BV and HR-HPV infection. Our findings require proof-of-concept functional studies to examine the relevance of these potential biomarkers in women's reproductive health and disease.

## Effect of metronidazole on vaginal microbiota associated with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis.
 22.06.2021, _D Ruiz-Perez, MS Coudray, B Colbert, K Krupp, H Kumari, V Stebliankin, K Mathee, RL Cook, J Schwebke, G Narasimhan, P Madhivanan_


Vaginal dysbiosis-induced by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria is referred to as bacterial vaginosis (BV). The dysbiosis is associated with an increased risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted infections. Women with symptomatic BV are treated with oral metronidazole (MET), but its effectiveness remains to be elucidated. This study used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to determine the changes in the microbiota among women treated with MET. WGS was conducted on DNA obtained from 20 vaginal swabs collected at four time points over 12 months from five randomly selected African American (AA) women. The baseline visit included all women who were diagnosed with asymptomatic BV and were untreated. All subjects were tested subsequently once every 2 months and received a course of MET for each BV episode during the 12 months. The BV status was classified according to Nugent scores (NSs) of vaginal smears. The microbial and resistome profiles were analysed along with the sociodemographic metadata. Despite treatment, none of the five participants reverted to normal vaginal flora - two were consistently positive for BV, and the rest experienced episodic cases of BV. WGS analyses showed Gardnerella spp. as the most abundant organism. After treatment with MET, there was an observed decline of Lactobacillus and Prevotella species. One participant had a healthy vaginal microbiota based on NS at one follow-up time point. Resistance genes including tetM and lscA were detected. Though limited in subjects, this study shows specific microbiota changes with treatment, presence of many resistant genes in their microbiota, and recurrence and persistence of BV despite MET treatment. Thus, MET may not be an effective treatment option for asymptomatic BV, and whole metagenome sequence would better inform the choice of antibiotics.

## GUNC: detection of chimerism and contamination in prokaryotic genomes.
 18.06.2021, _A Orakov, A Fullam, LP Coelho, S Khedkar, D Szklarczyk, DR Mende, TSB Schmidt, P Bork_


Genomes are critical units in microbiology, yet ascertaining quality in prokaryotic genome assemblies remains a formidable challenge. We present GUNC (the Genome UNClutterer), a tool that accurately detects and quantifies genome chimerism based on the lineage homogeneity of individual contigs using a genome's full complement of genes. GUNC complements existing approaches by targeting previously underdetected types of contamination: we conservatively estimate that 5.7% of genomes in GenBank, 5.2% in RefSeq, and 15-30% of pre-filtered "high-quality" metagenome-assembled genomes in recent studies are undetected chimeras. GUNC provides a fast and robust tool to substantially improve prokaryotic genome quality.

## Open challenges for microbial network construction and analysis.
 10.06.2021, _K Faust_


Microbial network construction is a popular explorative data analysis technique in microbiome research. Although a large number of microbial network construction tools has been developed to date, there are several issues concerning the construction and interpretation of microbial networks that have received less attention. The purpose of this perspective is to draw attention to these underexplored challenges of microbial network construction and analysis.

## A Review of Significant European Foodborne Outbreaks in the Last Decade.
 01.07.2021, _E Sarno, D Pezzutto, M Rossi, E Liebana, V Rizzi_


Foodborne diseases remain a global public health challenge worldwide. The European surveillance system on multistate foodborne outbreaks integrates elements from public and animal health, and the food chain for the early detection, assessment, and control. This review aims to describe the significant outbreaks that occurred in Europe in the last decade. Their significance and relevance in public health laid in the changes, improvements, and novelties that derived and that pushed towards the building of a safer food system in the European Union, certainly driven by the One Health approach. In 2011, a point source monoclonal outbreak of infections caused by Escherichia coli serotype O104:H4 contaminating sprouted seeds recorded hundreds of cases of haemolytic-uremic syndrome and several fatalities. In 2015, a prolonged outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections caused by the contamination of frozen corn affected Europe with 47 cases and nine deaths. In 2016, a persistent polyclonal outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis was linked to the consumption of eggs and was associated with hundreds of cases. These outbreaks commonly highlighted the importance of sharing data (e.g. sequencing and tracing data) with rapidity and the need for harmonizing bioinformatics outputs and computational approaches to facilitate foodborne detection and investigation. Also, they led to the setting of the legal framework for the development of a European collaboration platform to share whole genome sequences data. These outbreaks enabled the enforcement of the existing hygiene and food safety provisions and led the development of new hygiene guidelines and best practises. This paper also briefly touches upon the new trends in information technologies that are being explored in the field of food traceability and safety. Their application aims to enhance the traceability of food throughout the supply chain to redirect the conventional tracing system towards a digitized supply chain.

## When the World Breaks Down: A 3-Stage Existential Model of Nihilism in Schizophrenia.
 01.07.2021, _P Klar, G Northoff_


The existential crisis of nihilism in schizophrenia has been reported since the early days of psychiatry. Taking first-person accounts concerning nihilistic experiences of both the self and the world as vantage point, we aim to develop a dynamic existential model of the pathological development of existential nihilism. Since the phenomenology of such a crisis is intrinsically subjective, we especially take the immediate and pre-reflective first-person perspective's (FPP) experience (instead of objectified symptoms and diagnoses) of schizophrenia into consideration. The hereby developed existential model consists of 3 conceptualized stages that are nested into each other, which defines what we mean by existential. At the same time, the model intrinsically converges with the phenomenological concept of the self-world structure notable inside our existential framework. Regarding the 3 individual stages, we suggest that the onset or first stage of nihilistic pathogenesis is reflected by phenomenological solipsism, that is, a general disruption of the FPP experience. Paradigmatically, this initial disruption contains the well-known crisis of common sense in schizophrenia. The following second stage of epistemological solipsism negatively affects all possible perspectives of experience, that is, the first-, second-, and third-person perspectives of subjectivity. Therefore, within the second stage, solipsism expands from a disruption of immediate and pre-reflective experience (first stage) to a disruption of reflective experience and principal knowledge (second stage), as mirrored in abnormal epistemological limitations of principal knowledge. Finally, the experience of the annihilation of healthy self-consciousness into the ultimate collapse of the individual's existence defines the third stage. The schizophrenic individual consequently loses her/his vital experience since the intentional structure of consciousness including any sense of reality breaks down. Such a descriptive-interpretative existential model of nihilism in schizophrenia may ultimately serve as input for future psychopathological investigations of nihilism in general, including, for instance, its manifestation in depression.

## Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: In-Depth Computational Approach Revealing Multiple Sulfur's Reduction Pathways and Hidden Li+ Storage Mechanisms for Extra Discharge Capacity.
 14.01.2021, _S Perez Beltran, PB Balbuena_


Like no other sulfur host material, polyacrylonitrile-derived sulfurized carbon (SPAN) promises improved electrochemical performance for lithium-sulfur batteries, based on its compatibility with carbonate solvents and ability to prevent self-discharge and shuttle effect. However, a complete understanding of the SPAN's lithiation mechanism is still missing because its structural features vary widely with synthesis conditions, and its electrochemical performance deviates from elemental sulfur. This study continues our research on the elucidation of the SPAN's structural characteristics and lithiation mechanisms via computational approaches. Our models reproduce most experimental data regarding carbon's graphitization level and conjugated ordering, sulfur-carbon covalent bonding, sulfur loading, and elemental composition. Our simulations emulate the discharge voltage observed in experiments for the first discharge, which reveals that sulfur follows multiple reduction pathways based on its interaction with the carbon backbone. Sulfur reduction takes place above 1.0 V vs Li/Li+ mostly in the SPAN-like material, with no long-chain lithium polysulfide formation. Below 1.0 V vs Li/Li+, the backbone's electrochemical activity occurs via multiple C-Li and N-Li interactions, mostly with edge carbon atoms and pyridinic nitrogen. Moreover, we identify Li+ binding sites throughout the graphitized backbone that might lead to prohibited energy costs for Li+ deintercalation, which may explain the irreversible capacity loss between the first and second discharges. This work improves understanding of lithiation mechanisms in sulfurized carbon, which is useful for rationally designing SPAN synthesis pathways tailored to increase sulfur loading and enhanced electrochemical performance.
