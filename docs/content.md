## Gut microbiota and cardiovascular disease: opportunities and challenges.
 14.03.2020, _N Kazemian, M Mahmoudi, F Halperin, JC Wu, S Pakpour_


Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common health problem worldwide and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, it has become clear that the inhabitants of our gut, the gut microbiota, play a vital role in human metabolism, immunity, and reactions to diseases, including CAD. Although correlations have been shown between CAD and the gut microbiota, demonstration of potential causal relationships is much more complex and challenging. In this review, we will discuss the potential direct and indirect causal roots between gut microbiota and CAD development via microbial metabolites and interaction with the immune system. Uncovering the causal relationship of gut microbiota and CAD development can lead to novel microbiome-based preventative and therapeutic interventions. However, an interdisciplinary approach is required to shed light on gut bacterial-mediated mechanisms (e.g., using advanced nanomedicine technologies and incorporation of demographic factors such as age, sex, and ethnicity) to enable efficacious and high-precision preventative and therapeutic strategies for CAD.

## Pharmacomicrobiomics in inflammatory arthritis: gut microbiome as modulator of therapeutic response.
 11.03.2020, _JU Scher, RR Nayak, C Ubeda, PJ Turnbaugh, SB Abramson_


In the past three decades, extraordinary advances have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of, and treatment options for, inflammatory arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis. The use of methotrexate and subsequently biologic therapies (such as TNF inhibitors, among others) and oral small molecules have substantially improved clinical outcomes for many patients with inflammatory arthritis; for others, however, these agents do not substantially improve their symptoms. The emerging field of pharmacomicrobiomics, which investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs, has already provided important insights into these therapeutics. Pharmacomicrobiomic studies have demonstrated that human gut microorganisms and their enzymatic products can affect the bioavailability, clinical efficacy and toxicity of a wide array of drugs through direct and indirect mechanisms. This discipline promises to facilitate the advent of microbiome-based precision medicine approaches in inflammatory arthritis, including strategies for predicting response to treatment and for modulating the microbiome to improve response to therapy or reduce drug toxicity.

## Long-term metal exposure changes gut microbiota of residents surrounding a mining and smelting area.
 11.03.2020, _M Shao, Y Zhu_


In this epidemiologic study, 16 S rRNA sequencing was used to investigate the changes of diversity and composition profile of gut microbiota resulting from long-term exposure to multiple metals, including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cuprum (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). Due to long-term exposure to various metals, the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae, Eubacterium eligens, Ruminococcaceae UGG-014, Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003, Tyzzerella 3, Bacteroides, Slackia, italics, and Roseburia were found to become much higher, whereas the abundance of Prevotella 9 presented an opposite trend. Additionally, differences between males and female groups were found, such as the greater richness and evenness of bacteria for men subjected to long-term metal exposure in polluted areas. The changes of men's microbiomes were more significant as a result of higher daily intake, mining and smelting activity, and living habits. This research presents a new theoretical basis for the correlation between long-term metal exposure and gut health for people living in contaminated areas.

## Temporospatial shifts in the human gut microbiome and metabolome after gastric bypass surgery.

Although the etiology of obesity is not well-understood, genetic, environmental, and microbiome elements are recognized as contributors to this rising pandemic. It is well documented that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery drastically alters the fecal microbiome, but data are sparse on temporal and spatial microbiome and metabolome changes, especially in human populations. We characterized the structure and function (through metabolites) of the microbial communities in the gut lumen and structure of microbial communities on mucosal surfaces in nine morbidly obese individuals before, 6 months, and 12 months after RYGB surgery. Moreover, using a comprehensive multi-omic approach, we compared this longitudinal cohort to a previously studied cross-sectional cohort (n = 24). In addition to the expected weight reduction and improvement in obesity-related comorbidities after RYGB surgery, we observed that the impact of surgery was much greater on fecal communities in comparison to mucosal ones. The changes in the fecal microbiome were linked to increased concentrations of branched-chain fatty acids and an overall decrease in secondary bile acid concentrations. The microbiome and metabolome data sets for this longitudinal cohort strengthen our understanding of the persistent impact of RYGB on the gut microbiome and its metabolism. Our findings highlight the importance of changes in mucosal and fecal microbiomes after RYGB surgery. The spatial modifications in the microbiome after RYGB surgery corresponded to persistent changes in fecal fermentation and bile acid metabolism, both of which are associated with improved metabolic outcomes.

## Habitat and seasonality shape the structure of tench (Tinca tinca L.) gut microbiome.
 11.03.2020, _T Dulski, K Koz≈Çowski, S Ciesielski_


Tench (Tinca tinca L.) is one of the most valued species of the Cyprinidae. This species is commercially important and has been intensively domesticated in recent years. To avoid excessive production losses, the health of farm fish must be maintained. Characterization of the tench gut microbiome can help achieve this goal, as the gastrointestinal microbiome plays an important role in host health. As part of this characterization, investigating the influence of the environment and season will help to understand the interrelationship between host and gut microbiota. Therefore, our aim was to use high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to profile the gut microbiome of tench. We studied two populations in summer and autumn: wild tench living in a lake and tench living in a pond in a semi-intensive fish farm. We found that, in the gut microbiome of all fish, the most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Together, these phyla constituted up to 90% of the microbial communities. The abundance of Candidatus Xiphinematobacter differed significantly between lake and pond fish in summer, but not in autumn. In pond tench, Methylobacterium abundance was significantly lower in summer than in autumn. Mean Shannon, Chao1 indices and observed OTU's indicated that microbial biodiversity was greater in the gut of lake fish than in that of pond fish. Beta-diversity analysis showed significant divergence between groups with both weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance matrices. Principal coordinates analysis revealed that more of the variance in microbial diversity was attributable to environment than to season. Although some of the diversity in lake tench gut microbiota could be attributable to feeding preferences of individual fish, our results suggest that environment is the main factor in determining gut microbiome diversity in tench.

## Microecological Koch's postulates reveal that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis contributes to shrimp white feces syndrome.
 11.03.2020, _Z Huang, S Zeng, J Xiong, D Hou, R Zhou, C Xing, D Wei, X Deng, L Yu, H Wang, Z Deng, S Weng, S Kriengkrai, D Ning, J Zhou, J He_


Recently, increasing evidence supports that some complex diseases are not attributed to a given pathogen, but dysbiosis in the host intestinal microbiota (IM). The full intestinal ecosystem alterations, rather than a single pathogen, are associated with white feces syndrome (WFS), a globally severe non-infectious shrimp disease, while no experimental evidence to explore the causality. Herein, we conducted comprehensive metagenomic and metabolomic analysis, and intestinal microbiota transplantation (IMT) to investigate the causal relationship between IM dysbiosis and WFS.
