Clostridioides difficile is a spore-forming anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium responsible for a broad spectrum of intestinal symptoms and healthcare associated diarrhoea. The hypothesis of this work was that different in vitro conditions, notably pH and human faecal microbiota composition impact the germination or/and the growth of C. difficile. This study aimed to correlate growth kinetics of the bacterium with these two physiochemical parameters by using a static in vitro model. To better understand the initial gut colonization, several growth curve assays were carried out to monitor the behaviour of the spores and vegetative forms of a C. difficile strain 078 under different conditions mimicking the gut environment. When the faeces were added, no spore germination or growth was observed but C. difficile spores germinated in vitro when the pH was maintained between 6.6-6.9 regardless of four faeces donor. The evolution of microbiota studied by 16S rDNA profiling showed high proportions of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli/Shigella when C. difficile grew regardless of the inoculated faeces. This model helped us to understand that the germination and the growth of C. difficile is strongly pH dependent, and further research is needed to evaluate the potential impact of the gut microbiota composition on C. difficile.

## Polymorphic microbes: a new emerging hallmark of cancer.
 04.09.2022, _MP Lythgoe, BH Mullish, AE Frampton, J Krell_


Recognition of the microbiome (and 'polymorphic microbes' within them) as a new emerging hallmark of cancer reflects a wide body of rapidly evolving research. Microbes may be directly carcinogenic, impact host immune responses to promote malignancy, and may be key effectors in determining the efficacy of anticancer therapy. Manipulation of the microbiome is showing promise as an opportunity to influence cancer outcomes.

## A taxonomic note on the genus Prevotella: Description of four novel genera and emended description of the genera Hallella and Xylanibacter.
 08.09.2022, _TCA Hitch, K Bisdorf, A Afrizal, T Riedel, J Overmann, T Strowig, T Clavel_


The genus Prevotella comprises 55 species with validly published, and correct, names (at June 2021) that are phenotypically, ecologically and functionally diverse. This study used a range of comparative genome approaches (marker gene-based genome phylogeny, core genome phylogeny, average amino acid identity, percentage of conserved proteins and clade-specific marker genes) to identify large differences between the 53 species for which genomes are available, as well as two effectively published yet not validly named species and four novel species. These differences were consistent between the various analysis methods and justify the separation of Prevotella into multiple genera. While the distribution across 19 ecosystem types was unique for each species and inconsistent within clades, the functional repertoire based on the presence/absence of both PFAMs and CAZy families revealed distinct clustering based on the proposed genera. Based on the integration of all results, we propose the reclassification of species previously assigned to the genus Prevotella into seven genera, including four novel genera for which the names Segatella, Hoylesella, Leyella and Palleniella are proposed. In addition to the reclassification of Prevotella, this work describes four novel species, Hallella faecis, Xylanibacter rodentium, Xylanibacter muris, and Palleniella intestinalis.

## A curated data resource of 214K metagenomes for characterization of the global antimicrobial resistome.
 07.09.2022, _HM Martiny, P Munk, C Brinch, FM Aarestrup, TN Petersen_


The growing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) calls for new epidemiological surveillance methods, as well as a deeper understanding of how antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) have been transmitted around the world. The large pool of sequencing data available in public repositories provides an excellent resource for monitoring the temporal and spatial dissemination of AMR in different ecological settings. However, only a limited number of research groups globally have the computational resources to analyze such data. We retrieved 442 Tbp of sequencing reads from 214,095 metagenomic samples from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and aligned them using a uniform approach against ARGs and 16S/18S rRNA genes. Here, we present the results of this extensive computational analysis and share the counts of reads aligned. Over 6.76∙108 read fragments were assigned to ARGs and 3.21∙109 to rRNA genes, where we observed distinct differences in both the abundance of ARGs and the link between microbiome and resistome compositions across various sampling types. This collection is another step towards establishing global surveillance of AMR and can serve as a resource for further research into the environmental spread and dynamic changes of ARGs.

 06.09.2022, _E Celik, G Ozcan, C Vatansever, E Paerhati, MA Kuşkucu, O Dogan, SG Cekic, O Ergonul, A Gürsoy, Ö Keskin, F Can_


The maintenance of vaginal microbiota is an important factor to achieve optimum pregnancy outcomes. The study aims to describe the alterations in the composition of vaginal microbiota in pregnant women with COVID-19. This was a prospective case-control study. Vaginal swabs were collected from uninfected pregnant women (n=28) and pregnant women with COVID-19 (n=19) during the active phase of infection and within a month after recovering from infection. The vaginal microbiota on the swabs was examined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Shannon index indicates that alpha diversity is significantly higher in women with COVID-19 (P=0.012). There was a significant decrease in Firmicutes (P=0.014) with an increase in Bacteroidota (P=0.018) phyla and a decrease in Lactobacillus (P=0.007) genus in women with COVID-19 than those of uninfected pregnant women. The relative abundance of L.crispatus, L.iners, L.gasseri, and L.jensenii were lower in the COVID-19 group than in uninfected pregnant women. In subgroup analysis, the amount of Ureaplasma spp. was higher in women with moderate/severe than those of asymptomatic/mild disease (P=0.036). The study revealed that vaginal dysbiosis with low abundance of Lactobacillus species occurred in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. These findings may lead to new studies to elucidate the risk of pregnancy adverse outcomes related to COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

## Dissecting the role of the human microbiome in COVID-19 via metagenome-assembled genomes.
 06.09.2022, _S Ke, ST Weiss, YY Liu_


Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), primarily a respiratory disease caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is often accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. However, little is known about the relation between the human microbiome and COVID-19, largely due to the fact that most previous studies fail to provide high taxonomic resolution to identify microbes that likely interact with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we used whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing data together with assembly and binning strategies to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 514 COVID-19 related nasopharyngeal and fecal samples in six independent cohorts. We reconstructed a total of 11,584 medium-and high-quality microbial MAGs and obtained 5403 non-redundant MAGs (nrMAGs) with strain-level resolution. We found that there is a significant reduction of strain richness for many species in the gut microbiome of COVID-19 patients. The gut microbiome signatures can accurately distinguish COVID-19 cases from healthy controls and predict the progression of COVID-19. Moreover, we identified a set of nrMAGs with a putative causal role in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and revealed their functional pathways that potentially interact with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we demonstrated that the main findings of our study can be largely validated in three independent cohorts. The presented results highlight the importance of incorporating the human gut microbiome in our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease progression.

## Salivary microbiome in chronic kidney disease: what is its connection to diabetes, hypertension, and immunity?
 07.09.2022, _F Liu, J Sheng, L Hu, B Zhang, W Guo, Y Wang, Y Gu, P Jiang, H Lin, B Lydia, Y Sun, Y Tang, C Gu, S Wei, Q Zhai, W Chen, N Feng_


The association between oral dysbiosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has gained increasing attention in recent years. Diabetes and hypertension are the most common conditions in CKD. However, a case-control study with matched confounding variables on the salivary microbiome in CKD and the influence of diabetes and hypertension on the microbiome has never been reported.

## Does exposure to different types of menstrual protections affect the vaginal environment?
 04.09.2022, _N Tessandier, IB Uysal, B Elie, C Selinger, C Bernat, V Boué, S Grasset, S Groc, M Rahmoun, B Reyné, N Bender, M Bonneau, C Graf, V Tribout, V Foulongne, J Ravel, T Waterboer, C Hirtz, IG Bravo, J Reynes, M Segondy, CL Murall, N Boulle, T Kamiya, S Alizon_


The vaginal ecosystem is a key component of women's health. It also represents an ideal system for ecologists to investigate the consequence of perturbations on species diversity and emerging properties between organisational levels. Here, we study how exposure to different types of menstrual protection products is linked to microbial, immunological, demographic, and behavioural measurements in a cohort of young adult women who reported using more often tampons (n = 107) or menstrual cups (n = 31). We first found that cup users were older and smoked less than tampon users. When analysing health indicators, we detected potential associations between cups use reporting and fungal genital infection. A multivariate analysis confirmed that, in our cohort, reporting using cups over tampons was associated with the higher odds ratio to report a fungal genital infection diagnosis by a medical doctor within the last 3 months. We did not detect significant differences between groups in terms of their bacterial vaginal microbiota composition and found marginal differences in the level of expression of 20 cytokines. However, a multivariate analysis of these biological data identified some level of clustering based on the type of menstrual production preferred (cups or tampons). These results suggest that exposure to different types of menstrual products could influence menstrual health. Larger studies and studies with a more powered setting are needed to assess the robustness of these associations and identify causal mechanisms.

## Characterization of the oral and fecal microbiota associated with atopic dermatitis in dogs selected from a purebred Shiba Inu colony.
 06.09.2022, _J Uchiyama, T Osumi, K Mizukami, T Fukuyama, A Shima, A Unno, I Takemura-Uchiyama, Y Une, H Murakami, M Sakaguchi_


Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic and relapsing multifactorial inflammatory skin disease that also affects dogs. The oral and gut microbiota are associated with many disorders, including allergy. Few studies have addressed the oral and gut microbiota in dogs, although the skin microbiota has been studied relatively well in these animals. Here, we studied the AD-associated oral and gut microbiota in 16 healthy and nine AD dogs from a purebred Shiba Inu colony. We found that the diversity of the oral microbiota was significantly different among the dogs, whereas no significant difference was observed in the gut microbiota. Moreover, a differential abundance analysis detected the Family_XIII_AD3011_group (Anaerovoracaceae) in the gut microbiota of AD dogs; however, no bacterial taxa were detected in the oral microbiota. Third, the comparison of the microbial co-occurrence patterns between AD and healthy dogs identified differential networks in which the bacteria in the oral microbiota that were most strongly associated with AD were related with human periodontitis, whereas those in the gut microbiota were related with dysbiosis and gut inflammation. These results suggest that AD can alter the oral and gut microbiota in dogs.

## Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW18 from Kefir enhances the anti-tumor effect of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy by modulating the gut microbiota.
 07.09.2022, _J Zhao, Y Wang, J Wang, M Lv, C Zhou, L Jia, W Geng_


Research on probiotics assisting PD-1 inhibitors in anti-tumor therapy has attracted widespread attention. Therefore, it is important to find new probiotic strains with a PD-1 inhibitor promoting effect. This study aims to find a strain with a good promoting effect on PD-1 inhibitor treatment from 5 probiotic strains with the function of modulating the gut microbiota or enhancing immunity. A preclinical study on the effect of probiotics combined with PD-1 inhibitors in murine melanoma was designed. In this study, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW18 (ZW18) was found to have the best anti-melanoma effect among the probiotic candidates in PD-1 inhibitor treatment. ZW18 inhibited the tumor growth in PD-1-treated mice with an inhibition rate of 66.16% by activating the body's immunity and promoting the tumor CD8+ T cell infiltration. Moreover, the supplement of ZW18 optimized the composition of the gut microbiota in mice treated with PD-1 inhibitors, and significantly increased the abundance of Akkermansia, the Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group and Muribaculum. Collectively, ZW18 could be regarded as a potential candidate strain for promoting tumor immunotherapy. ZW18 combined with PD-1 inhibitors has a possibility of serving as a functional food to assist tumor immunotherapy.

## Longitudinal analysis of the rectal microbiome in dogs with diabetes mellitus after initiation of insulin therapy.
 07.09.2022, _NL Laia, PC Barko, DR Sullivan, MA McMichael, DA Williams, JM Reinhart_


There have been numerous studies in humans and rodents substantiating the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome in the pathogenesis and progression of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is a common endocrinopathy in dogs; however, little is known about the composition of the gut microbiome during the development and treatment of diabetes in this species. The objective of this pilot study was to characterize the gastrointestinal microbiome of dogs with diabetes mellitus at the time of diagnosis and over the first 12 weeks of insulin therapy and identify associations with glycemic control. Rectal swabs and serum for fructosamine measurement were collected from 6 newly diagnosed diabetic dogs at 2-week intervals for 12 weeks. Rectal samples were sequenced using 16S, ITS, and archaeal primers. Measures of alpha and beta diversity were assessed for changes over time; associations between absolute sequence variant (ASV) relative abundances and time and fructosamine concentration were identified using a microbiome-specific, multivariate linear effects model. No statistically significant changes over time were noted in alpha diversity and samples significantly grouped by dog rather than by time in the beta diversity analysis. However, multiple ASVs were negatively (Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Romboutsia, Collinsella) and positively (Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus gauveauii, Peptoclostridium) associated with time and two ASVs were positively associated with fructosamine (Enterococcus, Escherichia-Shigella). These changes in gastrointestinal microbial composition warrant further investigation of how they may relate to diabetes mellitus progression or control in dogs.

## Core Microbiota in the Rhizosphere of Heavy Metal Accumulators and Its Contribution to Plant Performance.
 06.09.2022, _J Luo, S Gu, X Guo, Y Liu, Q Tao, HP Zhao, Y Liang, S Banerjee, T Li_


Persistent microbial symbioses can confer greater fitness to their host under unfavorable conditions, but manipulating such beneficial interactions necessitates a mechanistic understanding of the consistently important microbiomes for the plant. Here, we examined the phylogenetic profiles and plant-beneficial traits of the core microbiota that consistently inhabits the rhizosphere of four divergent Cd hyperaccumulators and an accumulator. We evidenced the existence of a conserved core rhizosphere microbiota in each plant distinct from that in the non-hyperaccumulating plant. Members of Burkholderiaceae and Sphingomonas were the shared cores across hyperaccumulators and accumulators. Several keystone taxa in the rhizosphere networks were part of the core microbiota, the abundance of which was an important predictor of plant Cd accumulation. Furthermore, an inoculation experiment with synthetic communities comprising isolates belonging to the shared cores indicated that core microorganisms could facilitate plant growth and metal tolerance. Using RNA-based stable isotope probing, we discovered that abundant core taxa overlapped with active rhizobacteria utilizing root exudates, implying that the core rhizosphere microbiota assimilating plant-derived carbon may provide benefits to plant growth and host phenotype such as Cd accumulation. Our study suggests common principles underpinning hyperaccumulator-microbiome interactions, where plants consistently interact with a core set of microbes contributing to host fitness and plant performance. These findings lay the foundation for harnessing the persistent root microbiomes to accelerate the restoration of metal-disturbed soils.

## Global contribution of pelagic fungi to protein degradation in the ocean.
 07.09.2022, _E Breyer, Z Zhao, GJ Herndl, F Baltar_


Fungi are important degraders of organic matter responsible for reintegration of nutrients into global food chains in freshwater and soil environments. Recent evidence suggests that they are ubiquitously present in the oceanic water column where they play an active role in the degradation of carbohydrates. However, their role in processing other abundant biomolecules in the ocean in comparison with that of prokaryotes remains enigmatic. Here, we performed a global-ocean multi-omics analysis of all fungal-affiliated peptidases (main enzymes responsible for cleaving proteins), which constitute the major fraction (&gt; 50%) of marine living and detrital biomass. We determined the abundance, expression, diversity, taxonomic affiliation, and functional classification of the genes encoding all pelagic fungal peptidases from the epi- and mesopelagic layers.
