Sleep disorders are increasingly being characterized in modern society as contributing to a host of serious medical problems, including obesity and metabolic syndrome. Changes to the microbial community in the human gut have been reportedly associated with many of these cardiometabolic outcomes. In this study, we investigated the impact of sleep length on the gut microbiota in a large cohort of 655 participants of African descent, aged 25-45, from Ghana, South Africa (SA), Jamaica, and the United States (US). The sleep duration was self-reported via a questionnaire. Participants were classified into 3 sleep groups: short (&lt;7hrs), normal (7-&lt;9hrs), and long (≥9hrs). Forty-seven percent of US participants were classified as short sleepers and 88% of SA participants as long sleepers. Gut microbial composition analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing) revealed that bacterial alpha diversity negatively correlated with sleep length (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, sleep length significantly contributed to the inter-individual beta diversity dissimilarity in gut microbial composition (p&lt;0.01). Participants with both short and long-sleep durations exhibited significantly higher abundances of several taxonomic features, compared to normal sleep duration participants. The predicted relative proportion of two genes involved in the butyrate synthesis via lysine pathway were enriched in short sleep duration participants. Finally, co-occurrence relationships revealed by network analysis showed unique interactions among the short, normal and long duration sleepers. These results suggest that sleep length in humans may alter gut microbiota by driving population shifts of the whole microbiota and also specific changes in Exact Sequence Variants abundance, which may have implications for chronic inflammation associated diseases. The current findings suggest a possible relationship between disrupted sleep patterns and the composition of the gut microbiota. Prospective investigations in larger and more prolonged sleep researches and causally experimental studies are needed to confirm these findings, investigate the underlying mechanism and determine whether improving microbial homeostasis may buffer against sleep-related health decline in humans.

## The interplay between Sleep and Gut Microbiota.
 15.01.2022, _M Han, S Yuan, J Zhang_


Sleep is a universal physiological need in all species and is essential for the maintenance and recovery of various physiological functions of the body. In late years, the gut microbiota (GM), a vast and extraordinarily complex ecosystem located in human gastrointestinal tract that oversees an array of critical bodily functions, has become a popular focus among researchers. Accumulated evidences in this field have revealed that it exerts important roles in the regulation of some biological characteristics, especially metabolic, immunological and neurobehavioral functions. With the increasing comprehension of brain-gut axis, a bidirectional communication channel linking the brain and gut, the roles of GM in sleep are paid much attention to. Evidences have shown that the GM is essential for the maintenance of normal sleep physiology. In turn, it has also been demonstrated that the abnormal sleep patterns and duration affect the composition, diversity and function of the GM through the brain-gut-microbiota axis (BGMA). Present contributions have described several underlying factors that could be involved in the BGMA in sleep, such as the immune system, the vagus nerve, the neuroendocrine system, and bacterial metabolites. Furthermore, several interventions targeting the GM have been proved to be beneficial for amelioration of sleep problems. On this basis, in this review, we aim to explore the interaction between sleep and GM, and elucidate the therapeutic microbiota manipulations with potential promoting effects on sleep quality.

## High-sugar, high-fat, and high-protein diets promote antibiotic resistance gene spreading in the mouse intestinal microbiota.

Diet can not only provide nutrition for intestinal microbiota, it can also remodel them. However, is unclear whether and how diet affects the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the intestinal microbiota. Therefore, we employed selected high-sugar, high-fat, high-protein, and normal diets to explore the effect. The results showed that high-sugar, high-fat, and high-protein diets promoted the amplification and transfer of exogenous ARGs among intestinal microbiota, and up-regulated the expression of trfAp and trbBp while significantly altered the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites. Inflammation-related products were strongly correlated with the spread of ARGs, suggesting the intestinal microenvironment after diet remodeling might be conducive to the spreading of ARGs. This may be attributed to changes in bacterial membrane permeability, the SOS response, and bacterial composition and diversity caused by diet-induced inflammation. In addition, acceptor bacteria (zygotes) screened by flow cytometry were mostly Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and most were derived from dominant intestinal bacteria remodeled by diet, indicating that the transfer of ARGs was closely linked to diet, and had some selectivity. Metagenomic results showed that the gut resistance genome could be affected not only by diet, but by exogenous antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Many ARG markers coincided with bacterial markers in diet groups. Therefore, dominant bacteria in different diets are important hosts of ARGs in specific dietary environments, but the many pathogenic bacteria present may cause serious harm to human health.

## In vitro models of the canine digestive tract as an alternative to in vivo assays: Advances and current challenges.

Dogs occupy a full place in the family and their well-being is of paramount importance to their owners. Digestion, a complex process involving physicochemical, mechanical, and microbial parameters, plays a central in maintaining animals healthy. As in vivo studies in dogs are more and more restricted by ethical, regulatory, societal, and cost reasons, an alternative option resides in the use of in vitro models simulating the different parts of the canine gastrointestinal tract. This review paper first introduces digestion and gut microbiota as key factors in dog nutrition and health, under both healthy and diseased conditions (obesity and inflammatory bowel disease), by highlighting when relevant similarities or differences between human and canine digestion process. Then, we provide for the first time an in-depth description of currently available models of the canine digestive tract, discuss technical and scientific challenges that need to be addressed and introduce potential applications of in vitro gut models in food and veterinary fields. Even if the development of some in vitro models remains limited by a lack of in vivo data in dogs necessary for a relevant configuration and validation, translation of long-term expertise on human in vitro gut models to dog's ecosystem opens avenues for canine in vitro gut model development and their adaptation to specific digestive conditions associated to various ages, sizes, breeds and/or diets, under both physiological and diseased states.

Several approaches to manipulate the gut microbiome for improving the activity of cancer immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are currently under evaluation. Here, we show that oral supplementation with the polyphenol-rich berry camu-camu (CC, Myrciaria dubia) in mice shifted gut microbial composition, which translated into antitumor activity and a stronger anti-PD-1 response. We identified castalagin, an ellagitannin, as the active compound in CC. Oral administration of castalagin enriched for bacteria associated with efficient immunotherapeutic responses (Ruminococcaceae and Alistipes) and improved the CD8+/Foxp3+CD4+ ratio within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, castalagin induced metabolic changes, resulting in an increase in taurine conjugated bile acids. Oral supplementation of castalagin following fecal microbiota transplantation from ICI-refractory patients into mice supported anti-PD-1 activity. Finally, we found that castalagin binds to Ruminococcus bromii and promoted an anticancer response. Altogether, our results identify castalagin as a polyphenol that acts as a prebiotic to circumvent anti-PD-1 resistance.

Zebrafish have emerged as a major model organism to study vertebrate reproduction due to their high fecundity and external development of eggs and embryos. The mechanisms through which zebrafish determine their sex have come under extensive investigation, as they lack a definite sex-determining chromosome and appear to have a highly complex method of sex determination. Single-gene mutagenesis has been employed to isolate the function of genes that determine zebrafish sex and regulate sex-specific differentiation, and to explore the interactions of genes that promote female or male sexual fate. In this review, we focus on recent advances in understanding of the mechanisms, including genetic and environmental factors, governing zebrafish sex development with comparisons to gene functions in other species to highlight conserved and potentially species-specific mechanisms for specifying and maintaining sexual fate.
