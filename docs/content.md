## Cancer pharmacomicrobiomics: targeting microbiota to optimise cancer therapy outcomes.
 12.03.2022, _NL Ting, HC Lau, J Yu_


Despite the promising advances in novel cancer therapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), limitations including therapeutic resistance and toxicity remain. In recent years, the relationship between gut microbiota and cancer has been extensively studied. Accumulating evidence reveals the role of microbiota in defining cancer therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Unlike host genetics, microbiota can be easily modified via multiple strategies, including faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics and antibiotics. Preclinical studies have identified the mechanisms on how microbes influence cancer treatment outcomes. Clinical trials have also demonstrated the potential of microbiota modulation in cancer treatments. Herein, we review the mechanistic insights of gut microbial interactions with chemotherapy and ICIs, particularly focusing on the interplay between gut bacteria and the pharmacokinetics (eg, metabolism, enzymatic degradation) or pharmacodynamics (eg, immunomodulation) of cancer treatment. The translational potential of basic findings in clinical settings is then explored, including using microbes as predictive biomarkers and microbial modulation by antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modulations and FMT. We further discuss the current limitations of gut microbiota modulation in patients with cancer and suggest essential directions for future study. In the era of personalised medicine, it is crucial to understand the microbiota and its interactions with cancer. Manipulating the gut microbiota to augment cancer therapeutic responses can provide new insights into cancer treatment.

## Inhibition of lung microbiota-derived proapoptotic peptides ameliorates acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an incurable disease of unknown etiology. Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is associated with high mortality. Excessive apoptosis of lung epithelial cells occurs in pulmonary fibrosis acute exacerbation. We recently identified corisin, a proapoptotic peptide that triggers acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we provide insights into the mechanism underlying the processing and release of corisin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an anticorisin monoclonal antibody ameliorates lung fibrosis by significantly inhibiting acute exacerbation in the human transforming growth factorβ1 model and acute lung injury in the bleomycin model. By investigating the impact of the anticorisin monoclonal antibody in a general model of acute lung injury, we further unravel the potential of corisin to impact such diseases. These results underscore the role of corisin in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung injury and provide a novel approach to treating this incurable disease.

## Gut microbiota and fermentation-derived branched chain hydroxy acids mediate health benefits of yogurt consumption in obese mice.

Meta-analyses suggest that yogurt consumption reduces type 2 diabetes incidence in humans, but the molecular basis of these observations remains unknown. Here we show that dietary yogurt intake preserves whole-body glucose homeostasis and prevents hepatic insulin resistance and liver steatosis in a dietary mouse model of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes. Fecal microbiota transplantation studies reveal that these effects are partly linked to the gut microbiota. We further show that yogurt intake impacts the hepatic metabolome, notably maintaining the levels of branched chain hydroxy acids (BCHA) which correlate with improved metabolic parameters. These metabolites are generated upon milk fermentation and concentrated in yogurt. Remarkably, diet-induced obesity reduces plasma and tissue BCHA levels, and this is partly prevented by dietary yogurt intake. We further show that BCHA improve insulin action on glucose metabolism in liver and muscle cells, identifying BCHA as cell-autonomous metabolic regulators and potential mediators of yogurt's health effects.

## Gut microbiota determines the social behavior of mice and induces metabolic and inflammatory changes in their adipose tissue.

The link between the gut microbiota and social behavior has been demonstrated, however the translational impact of a certain microbiota composition on stable behavioral patterns is yet to be elucidated. Here we employed an established social behavior mouse model of dominance (Dom) or submissiveness (Sub). A comprehensive 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of Dom and Sub mice revealed a significantly different gut microbiota composition that clearly distinguishes between the two behavioral modes. Sub mice gut microbiota is significantly less diverse than that of Dom mice, and their taxa composition uniquely comprised the genera Mycoplasma and Anaeroplasma of the Tenericutes phylum, in addition to the Rikenellaceae and Clostridiaceae families. Conversely, the gut microbiota of Dom mice includes the genus Prevotella of the Bacteriodetes phylum, significantly less abundant in Sub mice. In addition, Sub mice show lower body weight from the age of 2 weeks and throughout their life span, accompanied with lower epididymis white adipose tissue (eWAT) mass and smaller adipocytes together with substantially elevated expression of inflammation and metabolic-related eWAT adipokines. Finally, fecal microbiota transplantation into germ-free mice show that Sub-transplanted mice acquired Sub microbiota and adopted their behavioral and physiological features, including depressive-like and anti-social behaviors alongside reduced eWAT mass, smaller adipocytes, and a Sub-like eWAT adipokine profile. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of the gut microbiome in determining dominance vs. submissiveness and suggest an association between gut microbiota, the eWAT metabolic and inflammatory profile, and the social behavior mode.
