More than 30 million children worldwide have moderate acute malnutrition. Current treatments have limited effectiveness, and much remains unknown about the pathogenesis of this condition. Children with moderate acute malnutrition have perturbed development of their gut microbiota.

## Bacterial-fungal interactions in the neonatal gut influence asthma outcomes later in life.
 20.04.2021, _RC Boutin, C Petersen, SE Woodward, A Serapio-Palacios, T Bozorgmehr, R Loo, A Chalanuchpong, M Cirstea, B Lo, KE Huus, W Barcik, MB Azad, AB Becker, PJ Mandhane, TJ Moraes, MR Sears, P Subbarao, KM McNagny, SE Turvey, B Finlay_


Bacterial members of the infant gut microbiota and bacterial-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been shown to be protective against childhood asthma, but a role for the fungal microbiota in asthma etiology remains poorly defined. We recently reported an association between overgrowth of the yeast Pichia kudriavzevii in the gut microbiota of Ecuadorian infants and increased asthma risk. In the present study, we replicated these findings in Canadian infants and investigated a causal association between early life gut fungal dysbiosis and later allergic airway disease (AAD). In a mouse model, we demonstrate that overgrowth of P. kudriavzevii within the neonatal gut exacerbates features of type-2 and -17 inflammation during AAD later in life. We further show that P. kudriavzevii growth and adherence to gut epithelial cells are altered by SCFAs. Collectively, our results underscore the potential for leveraging inter-kingdom interactions when designing putative microbiota-based asthma therapeutics.

## The effect of different contraceptive methods on the vaginal microbiome.
 17.04.2021, _C Bastianelli, M Farris, P Bianchi, G Benagiano_


Introduction: Following a historical overview, the effect of different contraceptive methods on vaginal microbiome has been reviewed and summarized.Areas covered: Effects of: combined hormonal contraceptives (oral or vaginal) and of progestin only (injectable and implantable), intrauterine devices/systems (copper- or levonorgestrel-releasing), on vaginal microbiome. In addition, mention is made of vaginal rings releasing antiviral drugs and lactic acid.Expert opinion: The vaginal microbiota (VM) is unique in that it is normally dominated by Lactobacillus species providing a degree of protection against infections; this however may vary, depending on the species and strains of Lactobacillus. Bacterial Vaginosis represents the most common dysbiosis of the VM and its prevalence can be influenced by use of contraception.Available evidence indicates that, under the influence of oral or systemically administered female sex hormones there is a promotion of vaginal eubiosis, with a prevalence of a healthy VM in which lactobacilli predominate.

## Temporal landscape of human gut RNA and DNA virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity.
 18.04.2021, _T Zuo, Q Liu, F Zhang, YK Yeoh, Y Wan, H Zhan, GCY Lui, Z Chen, AYL Li, CP Cheung, N Chen, W Lv, RWY Ng, EYK Tso, KSC Fung, V Chan, L Ling, G Joynt, DSC Hui, FKL Chan, PKS Chan, SC Ng_


Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the enveloped RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need.

## The Gut Microbiome: a New Frontier in Musculoskeletal Research.
 17.04.2021, _R Li, CG Boer, L Oei, C Medina-Gomez_


The human gut harbors a complex community of microbes that influence many processes regulating musculoskeletal development and homeostasis. This review gives an update on the current knowledge surrounding the impact of the gut microbiota on musculoskeletal health, with an emphasis on research conducted over the last three years.

## Inflammation-driven brain and gut barrier dysfunction in stress and mood disorders.
 20.04.2021, _E Doney, A Cadoret, L Dion-Albert, M Lebel, C Menard_


Regulation of emotions is generally associated exclusively with the brain. However, there is evidence that peripheral systems are also involved in mood, stress vulnerability vs resilience and emotion-related memory encoding. Prevalence of stress and mood disorders such as major depression, bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder is increasing in our modern societies. Unfortunately, 30-50% of individuals respond poorly to currently available treatments highlighting the need to further investigate emotion-related biology to gain mechanistic insights that could lead to innovative therapies. Here we provide an overview of inflammation-related mechanisms involved in mood regulation and stress responses discovered using animal models. If clinical studies are available, we discuss translational value of these findings including limitations. Neuroimmune mechanisms of depression and maladaptive stress responses have been receiving increasing attention and thus the first part is centered on inflammation and dysregulation of brain and circulating cytokines in stress and mood disorders. Next, recent studies supporting a role for inflammation-driven leakiness of the blood-brain and gut barriers in emotion regulation and mood are highlighted. Stress-induced exacerbated inflammation fragilizes these barriers which become hyperpermeable through loss of integrity and altered biology. At the gut level, this could be associated with dysbiosis, an imbalance in microbial communities, and alteration of the gut-brain axis which is central to production of mood-related neurotransmitter serotonin. Novel therapeutic approaches such as anti-inflammatory drugs, the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine and probiotics could directly act on the mechanisms described here improving mood disorder-associated symptomatology. Discovery of biomarkers has been a challenging quest in psychiatry, and we end by listing promising targets worth further investigation.

## The gut microbiota is associated with clinical response to statin treatment in patients with coronary artery disease.
 22.04.2021, _L Wang, W Zhou, M Guo, Y Hua, B Zhou, X Li, X Zhang, J Dong, X Yang, Y Wang, Y Wu, J She, J Mu_


The structure and composition of the gut microbiota influence patients' response to therapeutic interventions. It is also known that the response to statin treatment can vary greatly from one patient to another, suggesting a possible connection between microbiome composition and response to statins. In the present study, we aim to explore the influence of the microbiome composition on the response to statin treatment among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

## Dietary restrictions modulate the gut microbiota: Implications for health and disease.
 22.04.2021, _NS Schmidt, A Lorentz_


The health benefits of carefully restricting the energy intake in a strategic manner whilst avoiding malnutrition are widely discussed. In the recent years, the great impact of the gut microbiota on its host has been clarified more and more. Since the gut microbiota produces a number of metabolites and molecules that can affect host metabolism, modulating it with dietary restriction can influence the health and the progression of disease of its host on various levels. This review comprises 15 studies investigating the effect of different variants of fasting and caloric restriction on the gastrointestinal microbiome and its metabolites. The data suggest that changing the gut microbiota composition by dietary restriction has the potential to positively influence the progression of several diseases such as obesity, diabetes, neurological diseases or inflammatory bowel disease. Finally, the relevance of the findings for clinical practice is evaluated and approaches for future research are proposed.
