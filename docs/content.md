## The gut microbiota-brain axis in behaviour and brain disorders.
 23.10.2020, _LH Morais, HL Schreiber, SK Mazmanian_


In a striking display of trans-kingdom symbiosis, gut bacteria cooperate with their animal hosts to regulate the development and function of the immune, metabolic and nervous systems through dynamic bidirectional communication along the 'gut-brain axis'. These processes may affect human health, as certain animal behaviours appear to correlate with the composition of gut bacteria, and disruptions in microbial communities have been implicated in several neurological disorders. Most insights about host-microbiota interactions come from animal models, which represent crucial tools for studying the various pathways linking the gut and the brain. However, there are complexities and manifest limitations inherent in translating complex human disease to reductionist animal models. In this Review, we discuss emerging and exciting evidence of intricate and crucial connections between the gut microbiota and the brain involving multiple biological systems, and possible contributions by the gut microbiota to neurological disorders. Continued advances from this frontier of biomedicine may lead to tangible impacts on human health.

## Gut microbiota in pancreatic diseases: possible new therapeutic strategies.
 23.10.2020, _LL Pan, BB Li, XH Pan, J Sun_


Pancreatic diseases such as pancreatitis, type 1 diabetes and pancreatic cancer impose substantial health-care costs and contribute to marked morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have suggested a link between gut microbiota dysbiosis and pancreatic diseases; however, the potential roles and mechanisms of action of gut microbiota in pancreatic diseases remain to be fully elucidated. In this review, we summarize the evidence that supports relationship between alterations of gut microbiota and development of pancreatic diseases, and discuss the potential molecular mechanisms of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of pancreatic diseases. We also propose current strategies toward gut microbiota to advance a developing research field that has clinical potential to reduce the cost of pancreatic diseases.

## The Gut Microbiome and the Triple Environmental Hit Concept of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Pathogenesis.
 24.10.2020, _R Kellermayer, M Zilbauer_


The incidence of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have significantly increased in recent decades implicating environmental effects. The developmental origin of disease concept provides a theoretical framework by which the complex interplay between environmental factors and host cells, particularly during vulnerable time periods, ultimately cause disease, such as IBD. Epigenetics has been proposed as the underlying mechanism within this concept, turning environmental triggers into stable changes of cellular function. Adding further to the complexity of IBD is the gut microbiome, which is equally responsive to the environment, and can impact host cell function, where recent findings underscore the stochastic and individualized nature of such effects. We review the microbiome literature through a novel triple environmental hit concept (priming, modulation, and trigger) of IBD pathogenesis. We propose that there are at least 3 distinct stages during an individual's lifespan where random/stochastic events driven by environmental influences are necessary for ultimately developing IBD. By this means, we speculate that microbiome-directed therapeutics carry potential for individualized prevention and dynamic treatment of IBD.

## Allogenic stem cell transplant-associated acute graft versus host disease: a computational drug discovery text mining approach using oral and gut microbiome signatures.
 23.10.2020, _MF Beckman, DS Morton, F Bahrani Mougeot, JC Mougeot_


Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) is a major cause of non-relapse morbidity and mortality post-allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Using conventional literature search and computational approaches, our objective was to identify oral and gut bacterial species associated with aGVHD, potentially affecting drug treatment via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pathways.

## Experimental evolution makes microbes more cooperative with their local host genotype.
 23.10.2020, _RT Batstone, AM O'Brien, TL Harrison, ME Frederickson_


Advances in microbiome science require a better understanding of how beneficial microbes adapt to hosts. We tested whether hosts select for more-cooperative microbial strains with a year-long evolution experiment and a cross-inoculation experiment designed to explore how nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) adapt to legumes. We paired the bacterium Ensifer meliloti with one of five Medicago truncatula genotypes that vary in how strongly they "choose" bacterial symbionts. Independent of host choice, E. meliloti rapidly adapted to its local host genotype, and derived microbes were more beneficial when they shared evolutionary history with their host. This local adaptation was mostly limited to the symbiosis plasmids, with mutations in putative signaling genes. Thus, cooperation depends on the match between partner genotypes and increases as bacteria adapt to their local host.

## Proximal colon-derived O-glycosylated mucus encapsulates and modulates the microbiota.
 23.10.2020, _K Bergstrom, X Shan, D Casero, A Batushansky, V Lagishetty, JP Jacobs, C Hoover, Y Kondo, B Shao, L Gao, W Zandberg, B Noyovitz, JM McDaniel, DL Gibson, S Pakpour, N Kazemian, S McGee, CW Houchen, CV Rao, TM Griffin, JL Sonnenburg, RP McEver, J Braun, L Xia_


Colon mucus segregates the intestinal microbiota from host tissues, but how it organizes to function throughout the colon is unclear. In mice, we found that colon mucus consists of two distinct O-glycosylated entities of Muc2: a major form produced by the proximal colon, which encapsulates the fecal material including the microbiota, and a minor form derived from the distal colon, which adheres to the major form. The microbiota directs its own encapsulation by inducing Muc2 production from proximal colon goblet cells. In turn, O-glycans on proximal colon-derived Muc2 modulate the structure and function of the microbiota as well as transcription in the colon mucosa. Our work shows how proximal colon control of mucin production is an important element in the regulation of host-microbiota symbiosis.

## The Microbiota Profile in Inflamed and Non-Inflamed Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis.
 23.10.2020, _SJ Kousgaard, TY Michaelsen, HL Nielsen, KF Kirk, M Albertsen, O Thorlacius-Ussing_


The objective was to determine the bacterial composition in inflamed and non-inflamed pouches for comparison to the microbiota of healthy individuals. Pouch patients and healthy individuals were included between November 2017 and June 2019 at the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark. A faecal sample was collected from all participants for microbiota analysis using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Overall, 38 participants were included in the study. Eleven patients with a normally functioning pouch, 9 patients with chronic pouchitis, 6 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, and 12 healthy individuals. Patients with chronic pouchitis had overall lower microbial diversity and richness compared to patients with a normal pouch function (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.009) and healthy individuals (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001). No significant difference was found between patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and chronic pouchitis (microbial diversity p = 0.39 and richness p = 0.78). Several taxa from the family Enterobacteriaceae, especially genus Escherichia, were associated primarily with patients with chronic pouchitis, while taxa from the genus Bacteroides primarily were associated with healthy individuals and patients with a normally functioning pouch. Finally, a microbial composition gradient could be established from healthy individuals through patients with normal pouch function and familial adenomatous polyposis to patients with chronic pouchitis.

## The role of pro-, pre- and symbiotics in cancer: A systematic review.
 23.10.2020, _M Marta, R Maria, S Francesc_


Cancer is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pro-, pre- and symbiotics can modulate host metabolism and gut microbiota and potentially help prevent cancer and modulate the adverse effects (AEs) of treatments. Numerous studies on this role for pro-, pre- and symbiotics have reported inconsistent results. The purpose of this review was to examine current scientific evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of pro-, pre- and symbiotics on the incidence of complications and AEs, especially diarrhoea, in cancer management.

## Fiber and Prebiotic Interventions in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease: What Role Does the Gut Microbiome Play?
 23.10.2020, _GR Healey, LS Celiberto, SM Lee, K Jacobson_


The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex but is thought to be linked to an intricate interaction between the host's immune system, resident gut microbiome and environment, i.e., diet. One dietary component that has a major impact on IBD risk and disease management is fiber. Fiber intakes in pediatric IBD patients are suboptimal and often lower than in children without IBD. Fiber also has a significant impact on beneficially shaping gut microbiota composition and functional capacity. The impact is likely to be particularly important in IBD patients, where various studies have demonstrated that an imbalance in the gut microbiome, referred to as dysbiosis, occurs. Microbiome-targeted therapeutics, such as fiber and prebiotics, have the potential to restore the balance in the gut microbiome and enhance host gut health and clinical outcomes. Indeed, studies in adult IBD patients demonstrate that fiber and prebiotics positively alter the microbiome and improve disease course. To date, no studies have been conducted to evaluate the therapeutic potential of fiber and prebiotics in pediatric IBD patients. Consequently, pediatric IBD specific studies that focus on the benefits of fiber and prebiotics on gut microbiome composition and functional capacity and disease outcomes are required.

## Anti-Inflammatory and Intestinal Microbiota Modulation Properties of Jinxiang Garlic (Allium sativum L.) Polysaccharides toward Dextran Sodium Sulfate-Induced Colitis.
 23.10.2020, _X Shao, C Sun, X Tang, X Zhang, D Han, S Liang, R Qu, X Hui, Y Shan, L Hu, H Fang, H Zhang, X Wu, C Chen_


Garlic polysaccharides are great potential agents because of their anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and immunomodulation properties. However, few studies have reported their anti-inflammatory effects on improving the colon system and corresponding intestinal microbiota. Herein, a water-soluble garlic polysaccharide (WSGP) was extracted from Jinxiang garlic to evaluate its effects on ameliorating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a mouse model. The results showed that (1) after administration of the WSGP (200 or 400 mg/kg/day), the feed intake, body weight, and colon length of colitic mice were increased, while the disease activity index and the histological score of colitic mice were decreased; (2) the WSGP reduced the colonic tissue damage and inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors (interleukin 6, interleukin 1 beta , and tumor necrosis factor alpha); and (3) the WSGP enhanced the production of short-chain fatty acids and improved the composition of intestinal microbiota. The key microorganisms, including Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Mucispirillum, Helicobacter, Ruminococcus_1, and Ruminiclostridium_5, were identified to be associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. Taken together, this study proved that WSGP supplementation could alleviate DSS-induced colitis by improving mucosal barriers, blocking proinflammatory cytokines, and modulating gut microbiota.

## Metagenomic characterization of bacterial community and antibiotic resistance genes in representative ready-to-eat food in southern China.
 25.10.2020, _Y Li, W Cao, S Liang, S Yamasaki, X Chen, L Shi, L Ye_


Ready-to-eat (RTE) foods have been considered to be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance bacteria, which constitute direct threat to human health, but the potential microbiological risks of RTE foods remain largely unexplored. In this study, the metagenomic approach was employed to characterize the comprehensive profiles of bacterial community and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) in 18 RTE food samples (8 RTE meat, 7 RTE vegetables and 3 RTE fruit) in southern China. In total, the most abundant phyla in RTE foods were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. 204 ARG subtypes belonging to 18 ARG types were detected with an abundance range between 2.81 × 10-5 and 7.7 × 10-1 copy of ARG per copy of 16S rRNA gene. Multidrug-resistant genes were the most predominant ARG type in the RTE foods. Chloramphenicol, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, multidrug resistance, aminoglycoside, bacitracin, tetracycline and β-lactam resistance genes were dominant, which were also associated with antibiotics used extensively in human medicine or veterinary medicine/promoters. Variation partitioning analysis indicated that the join effect of bacterial community and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) played an important role in the resistome alteration. This study further deepens the comprehensive understanding of antibiotic resistome and the correlations among the antibiotic resistome, microbiota, and MGEs in the RTE foods.

## Toxin Degradation by Rumen Microorganisms: A Review.
 23.10.2020, _ZH Loh, D Ouwerkerk, AV Klieve, NL Hungerford, MT Fletcher_


Animal feeds may contain exogenous compounds that can induce toxicity when ruminants ingest them. These toxins are secondary metabolites originating from various sources including plants, bacteria, algae and fungi. Animal feed toxins are responsible for various animal poisonings which negatively impact the livestock industry. Poisoning is more frequently reported in newly exposed, naïve ruminants while 'experienced' ruminants are observed to better tolerate toxin-contaminated feed. Ruminants can possess detoxification ability through rumen microorganisms with the rumen microbiome able to adapt to utilise toxic secondary metabolites. The ability of rumen microorganisms to metabolise these toxins has been used as a basis for the development of preventative probiotics to confer resistance against the poisoning to naïve ruminants. In this review, detoxification of various toxins, which include plant toxins, cyanobacteria toxins and plant-associated fungal mycotoxins, by rumen microorganisms is discussed. The review will include clinical studies of the animal poisoning caused by these toxins, the toxin mechanism of action, toxin degradation by rumen microorganisms, reported and hypothesised detoxification mechanisms and identified toxin metabolites with their toxicity compared to their parent toxin. This review highlights the commercial potential of rumen inoculum derived probiotics as viable means of improving ruminant health and production.

## Gut dysbiosis associated with the rats' responses in methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference.
 23.10.2020, _C Yang, X Fu, W Hao, X Xiang, T Liu, BZ Yang, X Zhang_


Methamphetamine (MA) is a potent stimulant and notoriously addictive. Individuals respond to MA effects differently and thus have a varying susceptible risk of developing MA use disorder. Cumulative evidence has indicated that gut dysbiosis contributes to behavioral response to drug effects. However, the role of gut microbiota in the susceptible risk of developing MA use disorder has remained elusive. Using an MA-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) rat model, we administrated the same dose of MA to rats, which then showed distinct preferences in drug-related place, indicating their different responses to MA. From all of the MA-exposed rats, the eight with the highest CPP scores were labeled as group high CPP (H-CPP), and the eight with the lowest were labeled as group low CPP (L-CPP). By 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing, we found that the gut microbiota compositions differed between H-CPP and L-CPP. Specifically, Akkermansia was significantly higher in H-CPP and positively correlated with the CPP scores. Notably, H-CPP and L-CPP differed in the gut microbiota composition prior to the CPP training; Ruminococcus was the dominant phylotype in H-CPP at baseline. More importantly, rats pretreated by antibiotics showed a significantly stronger MA-induced CPP than did the controls. Our study demonstrates that the gut dysbiosis was associated with the MA-induced CPP, indicating that the gut microbiota might be important modulators for MA-induced behavior and vulnerability to MA use disorder.

## A High-Fat Diet Increases Gut Microbiota Biodiversity and Energy Expenditure Due to Nutrient Difference.
 23.10.2020, _B Wang, Q Kong, X Li, J Zhao, H Zhang, W Chen, G Wang_


A high-fat diet (HFD) can easily induce obesity and change the gut microbiota and its metabolites. However, studies on the effects of high-fat diets on the host have drawn inconsistent results. In this study, the unexpected results showed that the refined HFD increased gut microbiota diversity and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), causing an increase in energy metabolism. Further analysis revealed these changes were caused by the different fiber content in these two diets. Male C57BL/6J mice (4-5 weeks old) were fed either HFD or refined low-fat diet (LFD) for 14 weeks. The metabolic rates, thermogenesis, gut microbiome, and intestinal SCFAs were tested. The HFD triggered obesity and disturbed glucose homeostasis. Mice fed HFD ingested more fiber than mice fed LFD (p &lt; 0.0001), causing higher intestinal SCFA concentrations related to the increased abundances of specific bacteria in the HFD group. Also, the HFD increased metabolic heat and up-regulated thermogenesis genes uncoupling protein 1(Ucp-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (Pgc-1α) expression in the brown adipose tissue (BAT). It was revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing that the HFD increased gut microbial diversity, which enriched Desulfovibrionaceae, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, and Mucispirillum, meanwhile, reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, Faecalibaculum, and Blautia. The predicted metabolic pathways indicated HFD increased the gene expression of non-absorbed carbohydrate metabolism pathways, as well as the risks of colonization of intestinal pathogens and inflammation. In conclusion, the HFD was obesogenic in male C57BL/6J mice, and increased fiber intake from the HFD drove an increase in gut microbiota diversity, SCFAs, and energy expenditure. Meanwhile, the differences in specific nutrient intake can dissociate broad changes in energy expenditure, gut microbiota, and its metabolites from obesity, raising doubts in the previous studies. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether differences in specific nutrient intake will interfere with the results of the experiments.

## Microbiome-wide association studies reveal correlations between the structure and metabolism of the rhizosphere microbiome and disease resistance in cassava.
 23.10.2020, _L Zhang, J Zhang, Y Wei, W Hu, G Liu, H Zeng, H Shi_


Cassava is one of the most important staple food crops in tropical regions. To date, an understanding of the relationship between microbial communities and disease resistance in cassava has remained elusive. In order to explore the relationship among microbiome and phenotypes for further targeted design of microbial community, 16S rRNA and ITS of microbiome of ten cassava varieties were analyzed, and a distinctive microbial community in the rhizosphere showed significant interdependence with disease resistance. Shotgun metagenome sequencing were performed to elucidate the structure of microbiomes of cassava rhizosphere. Comprehensive microbiome studies were performed to assess the correlation between the rhizosphere microbiome and disease resistance. Subsequently, the metagenome of rhizosphere microbiome was annotated to obtain taxonomic information at species level and identify metabolic pathways that were significantly associated with cassava disease resistance. Notably, cassava disease resistance was significantly associated with Lactococcus sp., which specifically produces nisin. To definitively explain the role of nisin and underlying mechanism, analysis of nisin biosynthesis-associated genes together with in vitro and in vivo experiments highlighted the effect of nisin on inhibiting the growth of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam) and activating immune response in cassava. The new insights between cassava rhizosphere microbiome especially Lactococcus sp. and disease resistance provides valuable information into further control of cassava disease.

## Daring to be differential: metabarcoding analysis of soil and plant-related microbial communities using amplicon sequence variants and operational taxonomical units.

Microorganisms are not only indispensable to ecosystem functioning, they are also keystones for emerging technologies. In the last 15 years, the number of studies on environmental microbial communities has increased exponentially due to advances in sequencing technologies, but the large amount of data generated remains difficult to analyze and interpret. Recently, metabarcoding analysis has shifted from clustering reads using Operational Taxonomical Units (OTUs) to Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). Differences between these methods can seriously affect the biological interpretation of metabarcoding data, especially in ecosystems with high microbial diversity, as the methods are benchmarked based on low diversity datasets.

## Clustering on Human Microbiome Sequencing Data: A Distance-Based Unsupervised Learning Model.
 23.10.2020, _D Yang, W Xu_


Modeling and analyzing human microbiome allows the assessment of the microbial community and its impacts on human health. Microbiome composition can be quantified using 16S rRNA technology into sequencing data, which are usually skewed and heavy-tailed with excess zeros. Clustering methods are useful in personalized medicine by identifying subgroups for patients stratification. However, there is currently a lack of standardized clustering method for the complex microbiome sequencing data. We propose a clustering algorithm with a specific beta diversity measure that can address the presence-absence bias encountered for sparse count data and effectively measure the sample distances for sample stratification. Our distance measure used for clustering is derived from a parametric based mixture model producing sample-specific distributions conditional on the observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts and estimated mixture weights. The method can provide accurate estimates of the true zero proportions and thus construct a precise beta diversity measure. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted and suggest that the proposed method achieves substantial clustering improvement compared with some widely used distance measures when a large proportion of zeros is presented. The proposed algorithm was implemented to a human gut microbiome study on Parkinson's diseases to identify distinct microbiome states with biological interpretations.

## A generalized machine-learning aided method for targeted identification of industrial enzymes from metagenome: a xylanase temperature dependence case study.
 23.10.2020, _MF Shahraki, K Farhadyar, K Kavousi, MH Azarabad, A Boroomand, S Ariaeenejad, GH Salekdeh_


Growing industrial utilization of enzymes and the increasing availability of metagenomic data highlight the demand for effective methods of targeted identification and verification of novel enzymes from various environmental microbiota. Xylanases are a class of enzymes with numerous industrial applications and are involved in the degradation of xylose, a component of lignocellulose. The optimum temperature of enzymes is an essential factor to be considered when choosing appropriate biocatalysts for a particular purpose. Therefore, in-silico prediction of this attribute is a significant cost and time-effective step in the effort to characterize novel enzymes. The objective of this study was to develop a computational method to predict the thermal dependence of xylanases. This tool was then implemented for targeted screening of putative xylanases with specific thermal dependencies from metagenomic data and resulted in the identification of three novel xylanases from sheep and cow rumen microbiota. Here we present TAXyl (Thermal Activity Prediction for Xylanase), a new sequence-based machine learning method that has been trained using a selected combination of various protein features. This random forest classifier discriminates non-thermophilic, thermophilic, and hyper-thermophilic xylanases. The model's performance was evaluated through multiple iterations of six-fold cross-validations as well as holdout tests, and it is freely accessible as a web-service at arimees.com.
