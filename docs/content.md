## Gut microbiota as a transducer of dietary cues to regulate host circadian rhythms and metabolism.
 18.05.2021, _H Choi, MC Rao, EB Chang_


Certain members of the gut microbiota exhibit diurnal variations in relative abundance and function to serve as non-canonical drivers of host circadian rhythms and metabolism. Also known as microbial oscillators, these microorganisms entrain upon non-photic cues, primarily dietary, to modulate host metabolism by providing input to both circadian clock-dependent and clock-independent host networks. Microbial oscillators are generally promoted by plant-based, low-fat (lean) diets, and most are abolished by low-fibre, high-sugar, high-fat (Western) diets. The changes in microbial oscillators under different diets then affect host metabolism by altering central and peripheral host circadian clock functions and/or by directly affecting other metabolic targets. Here, we review the unique role of the gut microbiota as a non-photic regulator of host circadian rhythms and metabolism. We describe genetic, environmental, dietary and other host factors such as sex and gut immunity that determine the composition and behaviour of microbial oscillators. The mechanisms by which these oscillators regulate host circadian gene expression and metabolic state are further discussed. Because of the gut microbiota's unique role as a non-photic driver of host metabolism and circadian rhythms, the development and clinical application of novel gut microbiota-related diagnostics and therapeutics hold great promise for achieving and maintaining metabolic health.

## Roles for the gut microbiota in regulating neuronal feeding circuits.
 20.05.2021, _KB Yu, EY Hsiao_


The gut microbiota has the capacity to affect host appetite via intestinal satiety pathways, as well as complex feeding behaviors. In this Review, we highlight recent evidence that the gut microbiota can modulate food preference across model organisms. We discuss effects of the gut microbiota on the vagus nerve and brain regions including the hypothalamus, mesolimbic system, and prefrontal cortex, which play key roles in regulating feeding behavior. Crosstalk between commensal bacteria and the central and peripheral nervous systems is associated with alterations in signaling of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides such as dopamine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). We further consider areas for future research on mechanisms by which gut microbes may influence feeding behavior involving these neural pathways. Understanding roles for the gut microbiota in feeding regulation will be important for informing therapeutic strategies to treat metabolic and eating disorders.

## Gut-brain communication and obesity: understanding functions of the vagus nerve.
 20.05.2021, _HR Berthoud, VL Albaugh, WL Neuhuber_


Given the crucial role of the gastrointestinal tract and associated organs in handling nutrient assimilation and metabolism, it has long been known that its communication with the brain is important for the control of ingestive behavior and body weight regulation. It is also clear that gut-brain communication is bidirectional and utilizes both rapid neural and slower humoral mechanisms and pathways. However, progress in understanding these mechanisms and leveraging them for the treatment of obesity and metabolic disease has been hindered by the enormous dimension of the gut mucosa, the complexity of the signaling systems, and lack of specific tools. With the ascent of modern neurobiological technology, our understanding of the role of vagal afferents in gut-brain communication has begun to change. The first function-specific populations of vagal afferents providing nutritional feedback as well as feed-forward signals have been identified with genetics-guided methodology, and it is hoped that extension of the methodology to other neural communication pathways will follow soon. Currently, efficient clinical leveraging of gut-brain communication to treat obesity and metabolic disease is limited to a few gut hormones, but a more complete understanding of function-specific and projection-specific neuronal populations should make it possible to develop selective and more effective neuromodulation approaches.

## Exploiting unique features of the gut-brain interface to combat gastrointestinal cancer.
 20.05.2021, _A Schledwitz, G Xie, JP Raufman_


The gastrointestinal tract comprises a complex ecosystem with extensive opportunities for functional interactions between neoplastic epithelial cells and stromal, immune, neuronal, glial, and other cell types, as well as microorganisms and metabolites within the gut lumen. In this Review, we focus on interactions between gastrointestinal cancers and elements of the central and enteric nervous systems. This previously understudied but rapidly emerging area of investigation has blossomed in recent years, particularly with respect to improved understanding of neural contributions to the development and progression of esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and colon neoplasia. Cancer neuroscience offers great promise to advance our understanding of how neural-cancer interactions promote alimentary tract neoplasia. The resulting mechanistic insights can be leveraged to identify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and to develop novel therapeutic interventions.

## Evaluation of saliva as a source of accurate whole-genome and microbiome sequencing data.
 20.05.2021, _AF Herzig, L Velo-Suárez, G Le Folgoc, A Boland, H Blanché, R Olaso, L Le Roux, C Delmas, M Goldberg, M Zins, F Lethimonnier, JF Deleuze, E Génin_


This study sets out to establish the suitability of saliva-based whole-genome sequencing (WGS) through a comparison against blood-based WGS. To fully appraise the observed differences, we developed a novel technique of pseudo-replication. We also investigated the potential of characterizing individual salivary microbiomes from non-human DNA fragments found in saliva. We observed that the majority of discordant genotype calls between blood and saliva fell into known regions of the human genome that are typically sequenced with low confidence; and could be identified by quality control measures. Pseudo-replication demonstrated that the levels of discordance between blood- and saliva-derived WGS data were entirely similar to what one would expect between technical replicates if an individual's blood or saliva had been sequenced twice. Finally, we successfully sequenced salivary microbiomes in parallel to human genomes as demonstrated by a comparison against the Human Microbiome Project.

## Exercise attenuates bone mineral density loss during diet-induced weight loss in adults with overweight and obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
 18.05.2021, _J Mesinovic, P Jansons, A Zengin, B de Courten, AJ Rodriguez, RM Daly, PR Ebeling, D Scott_


Weight-loss-induced fat loss improves cardiometabolic health in individuals with overweight and obesity, however, weight loss can also result in bone loss and increased fracture risk. Weight-loss-induced bone loss may be attenuated with exercise. Our aim was to compare changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in adults with overweight and obesity who undertook diet-induced weight loss alone, or in combination with exercise.

## Altered gut microbiota correlates with cognitive impairment in Chinese children with Down's syndrome.
 17.05.2021, _S Ren, X Wang, J Qin, Q Mu, S Ye, Y Zhang, W Yu, J Guo_


Down's syndrome (DS), a common chromosomal disease caused by chromosome 21 trisomy, is the main cause of cognitive impairment in children worldwide. Emerging evidence suggests that the microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a potential role in cognitive impairment. However, data regarding gut microbiota alterations in DS patients remain scarce, especially data from children with DS. This case-control study was conducted to explore the gut microbiota composition in Chinese DS children. Additionally, the potential association between gut microbiota and cognitive function in DS was evaluated. Microbiota communities in the feces of 15 DS subjects and 15 matched controls were investigated using high-throughput Illumina Miseq sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. The relationships between gut microbiota composition and DS cognitive function scores were analyzed. The structure and richness of the gut microbiota differed between DS patients and healthy controls. The abundance of Acidaminococcaceae was decreased in DS patients. Moreover, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed increased modules related to peptidases and pyrimidine metabolism. Overall, we confirmed that gut microbiota alterations occurred in Chinese patients with DS. Additionally, the fecal microbiota was closely related to DS cognitive impairment. Larger cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and to clarify the mechanisms involved. Elucidating these novel findings in the field of microbiota-gut-brain axis will provide a promising strategy for future studies of DS cognitive impairment.

## The rumen microbiome: balancing food security and environmental impacts.
 13.05.2021, _I Mizrahi, RJ Wallace, S Moraïs_


Ruminants produce edible products and contribute to food security. They house a complex rumen microbial community that enables the host to digest their plant feed through microbial-mediated fermentation. However, the rumen microbiome is also responsible for the production of one of the most potent greenhouse gases, methane, and contributes about 18% of its total anthropogenic emissions. Conventional methods to lower methane production by ruminants have proved successful, but to a limited and often temporary extent. An increased understanding of the host-microbiome interactions has led to the development of new mitigation strategies. In this Review we describe the composition, ecology and metabolism of the rumen microbiome, and the impact on host physiology and the environment. We also discuss the most pertinent methane mitigation strategies that emerged to balance food security and environmental impacts.

## Components of the Gut Microbiome that Influence Bone Tissue-Level Strength.
 17.05.2021, _M Luna, JD Guss, LS Vasquez-Bolanos, M Castaneda, MV Rojas, JM Strong, DA Alabi, SD Dornevil, JC Nixon, EA Taylor, E Donnelly, X Fu, MK Shea, SL Booth, R Bicalho, CJ Hernandez_


Modifications to the constituents of the gut microbiome influence bone density and tissue-level strength, but the specific microbial components that influence tissue-level strength in bone are not known. Here we selectively modify constituents of the gut microbiota using narrow spectrum antibiotics to identify components of the microbiome associated with changes in bone mechanical and material properties. Male C57BL/6J mice (4 weeks) were divided into seven groups (n=7-10/group) and had taxa within the gut microbiome removed through dosing with: 1) ampicillin; 2) neomycin; 3) vancomycin; 4) metronidazole; 5) a cocktail of all four antibiotics together (with zero-calorie sweetener to ensure intake); 6) zero-calorie sweetener only or; 7) no additive (untreated) for 12 weeks. Individual antibiotics remove only some taxa from the gut while the cocktail of all four removes almost all microbes. After accounting for differences in geometry, whole bone strength was reduced in animals with gut microbiome modified by neomycin (-28%, p=0.002) and was increased in the group in which the gut microbiome was altered by sweetener alone (+ 39%, p &lt; 0.001). Analysis of the fecal microbiota detected seven lower ranked taxa differentially abundant in animals with impaired tissue-level strength and 14 differentially abundant taxa associated with increased tissue-level strength. Histological and serum markers of bone turnover and trabecular BV/TV did not differ among groups. These findings demonstrate that modifications to the taxonomic components of the gut microbiome have the potential to decrease or increase tissue-level strength of bone independent of bone quantity and without noticeable changes in bone turnover.

## MiMeNet: Exploring microbiome-metabolome relationships using neural networks.
 17.05.2021, _D Reiman, BT Layden, Y Dai_


The advance in microbiome and metabolome studies has generated rich omics data revealing the involvement of the microbial community in host disease pathogenesis through interactions with their host at a metabolic level. However, the computational tools to uncover these relationships are just emerging. Here, we present MiMeNet, a neural network framework for modeling microbe-metabolite relationships. Using ten iterations of 10-fold cross-validation on three paired microbiome-metabolome datasets, we show that MiMeNet more accurately predicts metabolite abundances (mean Spearman correlation coefficients increase from 0.108 to 0.309, 0.276 to 0.457, and -0.272 to 0.264) and identifies more well-predicted metabolites (increase in the number of well-predicted metabolites from 198 to 366, 104 to 143, and 4 to 29) compared to state-of-art linear models for individual metabolite predictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that MiMeNet can group microbes and metabolites with similar interaction patterns and functions to illuminate the underlying structure of the microbe-metabolite interaction network, which could potentially shed light on uncharacterized metabolites through "Guilt by Association". Our results demonstrated that MiMeNet is a powerful tool to provide insights into the causes of metabolic dysregulation in disease, facilitating future hypothesis generation at the interface of the microbiome and metabolomics.
