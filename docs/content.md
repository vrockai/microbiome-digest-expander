_Humans, Isometric Contraction, Muscle Stretching Exercises, Male, Adult, Muscle Strength, Range of Motion, Articular, Middle Aged, Muscle, Skeletal, Female_
Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump.

## Legume-supplemented feed for children hospitalised with severe malnutrition: a phase II trial.
 29.07.2024, _K Walsh, A Kiosa, P Olupot-Olupot, F Alaroker, W Okiror, M Nakuya, T Tssenyondo, D Aromut, BC Okalebo, R Muhindo, A Mpoya, EC George, GS Frost, K Maitland_


Children hospitalised with severe malnutrition have high mortality and readmission rates post-discharge. Current milk-based formulations target restoring ponderal growth but not the modification of gut barrier integrity or microbiome which increases the risk of gram-negative sepsis and poor outcomes. We propose that legume-based feeds rich in fermentable carbohydrates will promote better gut health and improve overall outcomes. We conducted an open-label phase II trial at Mbale and Soroti Regional Referral Hospitals, Uganda, involving 160 children aged 6 months to 5 years with severe malnutrition (mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt; 11·5 cm and/or nutritional oedema). Children were randomised to a lactose-free, chickpea-enriched legume paste feed (LF) (n 80) v. WHO standard F75/F100 feeds (n 80). Co-primary outcomes were change in MUAC and mortality to day 90. Secondary outcomes included weight gain (&gt; 5 g/kg/d), de novo development of diarrhoea, time to diarrhoea and oedema resolution. Day 90 MUAC increase was marginally lower in LF v. WHO arm (1·1 cm (interquartile range (IQR) 1·1) v. 1·4 cm (IQR 1·40), P = 0·09); day 90 mortality was similar (11/80 (13·8 %) v. 12/80 (15 %), respectively, OR 0·91 (95 % CI 0·40, 2·07), P = 0·83). There were no differences in any of the other secondary outcomes. Owing to initial poor palatability of the LF, ten children switched to WHO feeds. Per-protocol analysis indicated a trend to lower day 90 mortality and readmission rates in the LF (6/60 (10 %) and 2/60(3 %)) v. WHO feeds (12/71(17·5 %) and 4/71(6 %)). Further refinement of LF and clinical trials are warranted, given the poor outcomes in children with severe malnutrition.

Species composition of the healthy adult gut microbiota tends to be stable over time. Destabilization of the gut microbiome under the influence of different factors is the main driver of the microbial dysbiosis and subsequent impacts on host physiology. Here, we used metagenomics data from a Swedish longitudinal cohort, to determine the stability of the gut microbiome and uncovered two distinct microbial species groups; persistent colonizing species (PCS) and transient colonizing species (TCS). We validated the continuation of this grouping, generating gut metagenomics data for additional time points from the same Swedish cohort. We evaluated the existence of PCS/TCS across different geographical regions and observed they are globally conserved features. To characterize PCS/TCS phenotypes, we performed bioreactor fermentation with faecal samples and metabolic modeling. Finally, using chronic disease gut metagenome and other multi-omics data, we identified roles of TCS in microbial dysbiosis and link with abnormal changes to host physiology.

## Gut microbiome and schizophrenia: insights from two-sample Mendelian randomization.
 05.09.2024, _K Zhou, A Baranova, H Cao, J Sun, F Zhang_


Growing evidence suggests a potential link between the gut microbiome and schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiome is causally associated with schizophrenia. We performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization to detect bidirectional causal relationships between gut microbiome and schizophrenia. Summary genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of the gut microbiome from the MiBioGen consortium (n = 18,340) and schizophrenia (n = 130,644) were utilized in our study. Then a cohort of sensitive analyses was followed to validate the robustness of MR results. We identified nine taxa that exerted positive causal effects on schizophrenia (OR: 1.08-1.16) and six taxa that conferred negative causal effects on schizophrenia (OR: 0.88-0.94). On the other hand, the reverse MR analysis showed that schizophrenia may increase the abundance of nine taxa (OR: 1.03-1.08) and reduce the abundance of two taxa (OR: 0.94). Our study unveiled mutual causal relationships between gut microbiome and schizophrenia. The findings may provide evidence for the treatment potential of gut microbiomes in schizophrenia.

## Disease-associated microbiome signature species in the gut.
 12.09.2024, _J Li, PW O'Toole_


There is an accumulation of evidence that the human gut microbiota plays a role in maintaining health, and that an altered gut microbiota (sometimes called dysbiosis) associates with risk for many noncommunicable diseases. However, the dynamics of disease-linked bacteria in the gut and other body sites remain unclear. If microbiome alterations prove causative in particular diseases, therapeutic intervention may be possible. Furthermore, microbial signature taxa have been established for the diagnosis of some diseases like colon cancer. We identified 163 disease-enriched and 98 disease-depleted gut microbiome signature taxa at species-level resolution (signature species) from 10 meta-analyses of multiple diseases such as colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatic cancer, and COVID-19 infection. Eight signature species were enriched and nine were depleted across at least half of the diseases studied. Compared with signature species depleted in diseases, a significantly higher proportion of disease-enriched signature species were identified as extra-intestinal (primarily oral) inhabitants, had been reported in bacteremia cases from the literature, and were aerotolerant anaerobes. These findings highlight the potential involvement of oral microbes, bacteremia isolates, and aerotolerant anaerobes in disease-associated gut microbiome alterations, and they have implications for patient care and disease management.

## Synthesis of current pediatric urinary microbiome research.
 04.07.2024, _LM Jeries, TA Sysoeva, L Karstens, MS Kelly_


The human urinary bladder hosts a complex microbial community of low biomass referred to as the urobiome. While the composition of the urobiome has been investigated in adults for over a decade now, only a few studies have considered the presence and composition of the urobiome in children. It is critical to explore how the urobiome develops throughout the life span and how it changes in the presence of various health conditions. Therefore, we set to review the available data on pediatric urobiome composition and its development with age and disease. In addition, we focused on identifying and reporting specific gaps in our knowledge of the pediatric urobiome that we hope will be addressed by future studies in this swiftly developing field with fast-improving methods and consensus.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common entity of Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL) and is characterized by the presence of clonal malignant T cells in the skin. The role of the skin microbiome for MF development and progression are currently poorly understood. Using shotgun metagenomic profiling, real-time qPCR, and T cell receptor sequencing, we compared lesional and nonlesional skin of 20 MF patients with early and advanced MF. Additionally, we isolated Staphylococcus aureus and other bacteria from MF skin for functional profiling and to study the S. aureus virulence factor spa. We identified a subgroup of MF patients with substantial dysbiosis on MF lesions and concomitant outgrowth of S. aureus on plaque-staged lesions, while the other MF patients had a balanced microbiome on lesional skin. Dysbiosis and S. aureus outgrowth were accompanied by ectopic levels of cutaneous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including adaptation of the plaque-derived S. aureus strain. Furthermore, the plaque-derived S. aureus strain showed a reduced susceptibility towards antibiotics and an upregulation of the virulence factor spa, which may activate the NF-κB pathway. Remarkably, patients with dysbiosis on MF lesions had a restricted T cell receptor repertoire and significantly lower event-free survival. Our study highlights the potential for microbiome-modulating treatments targeting S. aureus to prevent MF progression.

## Design, Synthesis, and Bioevaluation of Novel NLRP3 Inhibitor with IBD Immunotherapy from the Virtual Screen.
 13.09.2024, _Z Zhang, H Wu, K Yin, X Zheng, Z Cao, W Guo, C Zhao, X Gu_


NLRP3, a crucial member of the NLRP family, plays a pivotal role in immune regulation and inflammatory modulation. Here, we report a potent and specific NLRP3 inhibitor Z48 obtained though docking-based virtual screening and structure-activity relationship studies with an IC50 of 0.26 μM in THP-1 cells and 0.21 μM in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Mechanistic studies indicated that Z48 could bind directly to the NLRP3 protein (KD = 1.05 μM), effectively blocking the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, consequently manifesting anti-inflammatory properties. Crucially, with acceptable mouse pharmacokinetic profiles, Z48 demonstrated notable therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of DSS-induced ulcerative colitis, while displaying no significant therapeutic impact on NLRP3KO mice. In conclusion, this study provided a promising NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor with novel molecular scaffold, poised for further development as a therapeutic candidate in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

## Host diet drives gut microbiome convergence between coral reef fishes and mammals.
 29.08.2024, _S Degregori, NMD Schiettekatte, JM Casey, SJ Brandl, A Mercière, KR Amato, F Mazel, V Parravicini, PH Barber_


Animal gut microbiomes are critical to host physiology and fitness. The gut microbiomes of fishes-the most abundant and diverse vertebrate clade-have received little attention relative to other clades. Coral reef fishes, in particular, make up a wide range of evolutionary histories and feeding ecologies that are likely associated with gut microbiome diversity. The repeated evolution of herbivory in fishes and mammals also allows us to examine microbiome similarity in relationship to diet across the entire vertebrate tree of life. Here, we generate a large coral reef fish gut microbiome dataset (n = 499 samples, 19 species) and combine it with a diverse aggregation of public microbiome data (n = 447) to show that host diet drives significant convergence between coral reef fish and mammalian gut microbiomes. We demonstrate that this similarity is largely driven by carnivory and herbivory and that herbivorous and carnivorous hosts exhibit distinct microbial compositions across fish and mammals. We also show that fish and mammal gut microbiomes share prominent microbial taxa, including Ruminoccocus spp. and Akkermansia spp., and predicted metabolic pathways. Despite the major evolutionary and ecological differences between fishes and mammals, our results reveal that their gut microbiomes undergo similar dietary selective pressures. Thus, diet, in addition to phylosymbiosis must be considered even when comparing the gut microbiomes of distantly related hosts.

## Diet-microbiome interactions promote enteric nervous system resilience following spinal cord injury.

_Animals, Spinal Cord Injuries, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Mice, Enteric Nervous System, Fatty Acids, Volatile, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Inulin, Disease Models, Animal, Diet, Dietary Fiber, Interleukin-10, Female_
Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in numerous systemic dysfunctions, including intestinal dysmotility and enteric nervous system (ENS) atrophy. The ENS has capacity to recover following perturbation, yet intestinal pathologies persist. With emerging evidence demonstrating SCI-induced alterations to gut microbiome composition, we hypothesized that microbiome modulation contributes to post-injury enteric recovery. Here, we show that intervention with the dietary fiber, inulin, prevents SCI-induced ENS atrophy and dysmotility in mice. While SCI-associated microbiomes and specific injury-sensitive gut microbes are not sufficient to modulate intestinal dysmotility after injury, intervention with microbially-derived short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites prevents ENS dysfunctions in injured mice. Notably, inulin-mediated resilience is dependent on IL-10 signaling, highlighting a critical diet-microbiome-immune axis that promotes ENS resilience post-injury. Overall, we demonstrate that diet and microbially-derived signals distinctly impact ENS survival after traumatic spinal injury and represent a foundation to uncover etiological mechanisms and future therapeutics for SCI-induced neurogenic bowel.

Trees are associated with a broad range of microorganisms colonising the diverse tissues of their host. However, the early dynamics of the microbiota assembly microbiota from the root to shoot axis and how it is linked to root exudates and metabolite contents of tissues remain unclear. Here, we characterised how fungal and bacterial communities are altering root exudates as well as root and shoot metabolomes in parallel with their establishment in poplar cuttings (Populus tremula x tremuloides clone T89) over 30 days of growth. Sterile poplar cuttings were planted in natural or gamma irradiated soils. Bulk and rhizospheric soils, root and shoot tissues were collected from day 1 to day 30 to track the dynamic changes of fungal and bacterial communities in the different habitats by DNA metabarcoding. Root exudates and root and shoot metabolites were analysed in parallel by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.

## The predicted secreted proteome of activated sludge microorganisms indicates distinct nutrient niches.
 10.09.2024, _K Wasmund, C Singleton, MK Dahl Dueholm, M Wagner, PH Nielsen_


In wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), complex microbial communities process diverse chemical compounds from sewage. Secreted proteins are critical because many are the first to interact with or degrade external (macro)molecules. To better understand microbial functions in WWTPs, we predicted secreted proteomes of WWTP microbiota from more than 1,000 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 23 Danish WWTPs with biological nutrient removal. Focus was placed on examining secreted catabolic exoenzymes that target major classes of macromolecules. We demonstrate that Bacteroidota has a high potential to digest complex polysaccharides, but also proteins and nucleic acids. Poorly understood activated sludge members of Acidobacteriota and Gemmatimonadota also have high capacities for extracellular polysaccharide digestion. Secreted nucleases are encoded by 61% of MAGs indicating an importance for extracellular DNA and/or RNA digestion in WWTPs. Secreted lipases were the least common macromolecule-targeting enzymes predicted, encoded mainly by Gammaproteobacteria and Myxococcota. In contrast, diverse taxa encode extracellular peptidases, indicating that proteins are widely used nutrients. Diverse secreted multi-heme cytochromes suggest capabilities for extracellular electron transfer by various taxa, including some Bacteroidota that encode undescribed cytochromes with &gt;100 heme-binding motifs. Myxococcota have exceptionally large secreted protein complements, probably related to predatory lifestyles and/or complex cell cycles. Many Gammaproteobacteria MAGs (mostly former Betaproteobacteria) encode few or no secreted hydrolases, but many periplasmic substrate-binding proteins and ABC- and TRAP-transporters, suggesting they are mostly sustained by small molecules. Together, this study provides a comprehensive overview of how WWTPs microorganisms interact with the environment, providing new insights into their functioning and niche partitioning.IMPORTANCEWastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are critical biotechnological systems that clean wastewater, allowing the water to reenter the environment and limit eutrophication and pollution. They are also increasingly important for the recovery of resources. They function primarily by the activity of microorganisms, which act as a "living sponge," taking up and transforming nutrients, organic material, and pollutants. Despite much research, many microorganisms in WWTPs are uncultivated and poorly characterized, limiting our understanding of their functioning. Here, we analyzed a large collection of high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes from WWTPs for encoded secreted enzymes and proteins, with special emphasis on those used to degrade organic material. This analysis showed highly distinct secreted proteome profiles among different major phylogenetic groups of microorganisms, thereby providing new insights into how different groups function and co-exist in activated sludge. This knowledge will contribute to a better understanding of how to efficiently manage and exploit WWTP microbiomes.

## Wastewater-based epidemiology to assess pharmaceutical consumption. Spanish perspective.
 12.09.2024, _N Fontanals, RM Marcé, R Montes, R Rodil, I González-Mariño, Y Valcárcel, S Rodríguez-Mozaz, F Borrull, JB Quintana, E Pocurull_


Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a well-established approach that can provide objective and real-time data on the consumption of substances such as pharmaceuticals. However, most of the studies reported so far compares consumption data obtained using WBE with those derived from prescription data from public health systems, which is often incomplete and might represent a source of uncertainty. This study aims to compare the measured pharmaceutical consumption back calculated with the WBE approach with consumption derived from dispensed pharmaceuticals in two regions of Spain, managed by two different Health Systems. To do so, a group of 17 pharmaceuticals, including the most representative ones of every therapeutic family, were monitored in influent wastewater (IWW) samples collected over a week campaign in spring 2022 at four different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Spain: two WWTPs in Madrid city (center of Spain) and two WWTPs in Catalonia (Northeast of Spain). Population-normalized daily loads (PNDLs) revealed that the patterns of pharmaceutical occurrence in the different WWTPs are very similar, being acetaminophen, 4-acetamidoantipyrine and valsartan the pharmaceuticals with the highest PNDL values: 17162 ± 1457 mg day-1 1000 inh-1 for acetaminophen, 2365 ± 696 and 2429 ± 263 mg day-1 1000 inh-1 for 4-acetamidoantipyrine, 2006 ± 541 and 2041 ± 352 mg day-1 1000 inh-1 for valsartan. Pharmaceutical PNLDs were then transformed into measured pharmaceutical consumption (MC) and compared with dispensed consumption (DC) data obtained from the pharmacies in the catchment area where the WWTPs are located. A ratio MC/DC within 0.8 to 1.2 was obtained for 11 out of the 17 studied pharmaceuticals. Highlighting a match in all the cardiovascular system pharmaceuticals, with the exception of losartan (1.29-1.39 ratio) and valsartan (1.35-1.43) in all WWTPs. In summary, the degree of correlation between MC/DC is higher than those previously reported comparing with the prescribed pharmaceutical consumption.

The Changjiang Estuary and adjacent East China Sea are well-known hypoxic aquatic environments. Eutrophication-driven hypoxia frequently occurs in coastal areas, posing a major threat to the ecological environment, including altering community structure and metabolic processes of marine organisms, and enhancing diversion of energy shunt into microbial communities. However, the responses of microbial communities and their metabolic pathways to coastal hypoxia remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the microbial communities collected from spatiotemporal samplings using metagenomic sequencing in the Changjiang Estuary and adjacent East China Sea. This generated 1.31 Tbp of metagenomics data, distributed across 103 samples corresponding to 8 vertical profiles. We further reported 1,559 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), of which 508 were high-quality MAGs (Completeness &gt; 90% and Contamination &lt; 10%). Phylogenomic analysis classified them into 181 archaeal and 1,378 bacterial MAGs. These results provided a valuable metagenomic dataset available for further investigation of the effects of hypoxia on marine microorganisms.

Improvements in movement quality (ie, how well an individual moves) facilitate increases in movement quantity, subsequently improving general health and quality of life. Wearable technology offers a convenient, affordable means of measuring and assessing movement quality for the general population, while technology more broadly can provide constructive feedback through various modalities. Considering the perspectives of professionals involved in the development and implementation of technology helps translate user needs into effective strategies for the optimal application of consumer technologies to enhance movement quality.

## A comparative analysis of the Trauma and Injury Severity Score and the Injury Severity Score in predicting high-value care outcomes in children with traumatic brain injury.
 13.09.2024, _F Kazemi, J Liu, IW Nasr, S Robinson, AR Cohen_


Predicting high-value care outcomes is crucial in managing pediatric traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), where timely and accurate prognostication can significantly influence treatment decisions and resource allocation. This study aimed to enhance understanding of how well scoring systems such as the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) can forecast high-value care outcomes. Furthermore, the authors compared the predictive power of TRISS with the routinely used Injury Severity Score (ISS).
