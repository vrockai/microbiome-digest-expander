## HPV vaccination hesitancy in Reunion Island.
 02.12.2021, _TP Lien, A Bruneteaux, G Lazaro, B Antoine, B Malik_


In Reunion Island (RUN), cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer in women and standardized mortality rate is 4.8 for 100 000 women. It is preventable by HPV vaccination, yet only 8.1% of girls aged &lt;16 years old are fully vaccinated.

## Development and characterization of an oral microbiome transplant among Australians for the treatment of dental caries and periodontal disease: A study protocol.
 29.11.2021, _S Nath, P Zilm, L Jamieson, K Kapellas, N Goswami, K Ketagoda, LS Weyrich_


Oral microbiome transplantation (OMT) is a novel concept of introducing health-associated oral microbiota into the oral cavity of a diseased patient. The premise is to reverse the state of oral dysbiosis, and restore the ecological balance to maintain a stable homeostasis with the host immune system. This study will assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and safety of OMT using an interdisciplinary approach.

## When and why direct transmission models can be used for environmentally persistent pathogens.
 01.12.2021, _L Benson, RS Davidson, DM Green, A Hoyle, MR Hutchings, G Marion_


Variants of the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model of Kermack &amp; McKendrick (1927) enjoy wide application in epidemiology, offering simple yet powerful inferential and predictive tools in the study of diverse infectious diseases across human, animal and plant populations. Direct transmission models (DTM) are a subset of these that treat the processes of disease transmission as comprising a series of discrete instantaneous events. Infections transmitted indirectly by persistent environmental pathogens, however, are examples where a DTM description might fail and are perhaps better described by models that comprise explicit environmental transmission routes, so-called environmental transmission models (ETM). In this paper we discuss the stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) DTM and susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-pathogen (SEIR-P) ETM and we show that the former is the timescale separation limit of the latter, with ETM host-disease dynamics increasingly resembling those of a DTM when the pathogen's characteristic timescale is shortened, relative to that of the host population. Using graphical posterior predictive checks (GPPC), we investigate the validity of the SEIR model when fitted to simulated SEIR-P host infection and removal times. Such analyses demonstrate how, in many cases, the SEIR model is robust to departure from direct transmission. Finally, we present a case study of white spot disease (WSD) in penaeid shrimp with rates of environmental transmission and pathogen decay (SEIR-P model parameters) estimated using published results of experiments. Using SEIR and SEIR-P simulations of a hypothetical WSD outbreak management scenario, we demonstrate how relative shortening of the pathogen timescale comes about in practice. With atttempts to remove diseased shrimp from the population every 24h, we see SEIR and SEIR-P model outputs closely conincide. However, when removals are 6-hourly, the two models' mean outputs diverge, with distinct predictions of outbreak size and duration.

## Transparency in peer review: Exploring the content and tone of reviewers' confidential comments to editors.
 29.11.2021, _BC O'Brien, AR Artino, JA Costello, E Driessen, LA Maggio_


Recent calls to improve transparency in peer review have prompted examination of many aspects of the peer-review process. Peer-review systems often allow confidential comments to editors that could reduce transparency to authors, yet this option has escaped scrutiny. Our study explores 1) how reviewers use the confidential comments section and 2) alignment between comments to the editor and comments to authors with respect to content and tone.
