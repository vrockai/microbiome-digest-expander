SignificanceMany human diseases are causally linked to the gut microbiota, yet the field still lacks mechanistic understanding of the underlying complex interactions, because existing tools cannot simultaneously quantify microbial communities and their native context. In this work, we provide an approach to tissue clearing and preservation that enables 3D visualization of the biogeography of the host-microbiota interface. We combine this tool with sequencing and multiplexed microbial labeling to provide the field with a platform on which to discover patterns in the spatial distribution of microbes. We validated this platform by quantifying bacterial distribution in cecal mucosa at different stages of antibiotic exposure. This approach may enable researchers to formulate and test new hypotheses about host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions.

Dietary fibers act through the microbiome to improve cardiovascular health and prevent metabolic disorders and cancer. To understand the health benefits of dietary fiber supplementation, we investigated two popular purified fibers, arabinoxylan (AX) and long-chain inulin (LCI), and a mixture of five fibers. We present multiomic signatures of metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, metagenomics, a cytokine panel, and clinical measurements on healthy and insulin-resistant participants. Each fiber is associated with fiber-dependent biochemical and microbial responses. AX consumption associates with a significant reduction in LDL and an increase in bile acids, contributing to its observed cholesterol reduction. LCI is associated with an increase in Bifidobacterium. However, at the highest LCI dose, there is increased inflammation and elevation in the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase. This study yields insights into the effects of fiber supplementation and the mechanisms behind fiber-induced cholesterol reduction, and it shows effects of individual, purified fibers on the microbiome.

_Amniotic Fluid, Female, Humans, Metagenomics, Microbiota, Nucleic Acids, Uterus_
As metagenomic approaches for detecting infectious agents have improved, each tissue that was once thought to be sterile has been found to harbor a variety of microorganisms. Controversy still exists over the status of amniotic fluid, which is part of an immunologically privileged zone that is required to prevent maternal immune system rejection of the fetus. Due to this privilege, the exclusion of microbes has been proposed to be mandatory, leading to the sterile womb hypothesis. Since nucleic acid yields from amniotic fluid are very low, contaminating nucleic acid found in water, reagents and the laboratory environment frequently confound attempts to address this hypothesis. Here we present metagenomic criteria for microorganism detection and a metagenomic method able to be performed with small volumes of starting material, while controlling for exogenous contamination, to circumvent these and other pitfalls. We use this method to show that human mid-gestational amniotic fluid has no detectable virome or microbiome, supporting the sterile womb hypothesis.

The gut microbiome influences the development of allergic diseases during early childhood. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of microbiome-host crosstalk. Here, we analyzed the influence of gut microbiome dynamics in early childhood on atopic dermatitis (AD) and the potential interactions between host and microbiome that control this homeostasis. We analyzed the gut microbiome in 346 fecal samples (6-36 months; 112 non-AD, 110 mild AD, and 124 moderate to severe AD) from the Longitudinal Cohort for Childhood Origin of Asthma and Allergic Disease birth cohort. The microbiome-host interactions were analyzed in animal and in vitro cell assays. Although the gut microbiome maturated with age in both AD and non-AD groups, its development was disordered in the AD group. Disordered colonization of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) producers along with age led to abnormal SCFA production and increased IgE levels. A butyrate deficiency and downregulation of GPR109A and PPAR-γ genes were detected in AD-induced mice. Insufficient butyrate decreases the oxygen consumption rate of host cells, which can release oxygen to the gut and perturb the gut microbiome. The disordered gut microbiome development could aggravate balanced microbiome-host interactions, including immune responses during early childhood with AD.

To date, only one study has reported changes in the gut microbiome of an ultramarathon runner before and after competing in the race. Herein we aimed to investigate changes in intestinal microbiota in nine ultramarathon runners. Eight of the nine participants ran 96.102 km (up 8062 m, down 6983 km) and one ran 99.12 km (up 8448 m, down 7369 m) within 38-44 h. Intestinal microbiota alterations were examined at three timepoints: before (Pre), after (Post), and 10 days after (Recovery) the race. The α- and β-diversity of intestinal microbiota were unaffected by the race. Six of the nine participants showed the B-type enterotype, while the remaining three showed the P-type enterotype; however, significant difference between enterotypes was not observed in the influence of the ultramarathon on intestinal microbiota. The abundance of mean Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was significantly decreased from 2.9% (Pre) to 1.6% (Post), as well as other three butyrate producing bacteria. One participant with the largest decrease in F. prausnitzii abundance (- 85.7%) reported sluggishness and shallow sleep from Post to Recovery. Our findings revealed that the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria is decreased in ultramarathon runners, which consequently decreases butyrate levels in the intestine and affects host immune function.

_Animals, Bone Marrow Transplantation, Cytokines, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Immune System, Mice, Spleen_
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) involves conditioning regimens which acutely induce side effects, including systemic inflammation, intestinal damage and shifts in the gut microbial composition, some of which may persist chronically. As the gut microbiota affect systemic immune responses, we aimed to investigate whether, post-BMT, the peripheral immune system is modulated as a direct consequence of alterations in the gut microbiota. We show that 24 weeks post-BMT, splenocytes but not peritoneal macrophages display increased cytokine response patterns upon ex-vivo stimulation with various pathogens as compared to untreated controls. The pattern of BMT-induced cytokine responses was transferred to splenocytes, and not to peritoneal macrophages, of healthy controls via co-housing and transferred to germfree mice via transplantation of cecum content. Thus, BMT induces changes in gut microbiota that in their turn increase cytokine responsiveness of splenocytes. Thus, BMT establishes a dominant microbiota that attenuates normalization of the immune-response.

## Gut microbial β-glucuronidases regulate host luminal proteases and are depleted in irritable bowel syndrome.
 28.04.2022, _AL Edwinson, L Yang, S Peters, N Hanning, P Jeraldo, P Jagtap, JB Simpson, TY Yang, P Kumar, S Mehta, A Nair, M Breen-Lyles, L Chikkamenahalli, RP Graham, B De Winter, R Patel, S Dasari, P Kashyap, T Griffin, J Chen, G Farrugia, MR Redinbo, M Grover_


Intestinal proteases mediate digestion and immune signalling, while increased gut proteolytic activity disrupts the intestinal barrier and generates visceral hypersensitivity, which is common in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the mechanisms controlling protease function are unclear. Here we show that members of the gut microbiota suppress intestinal proteolytic activity through production of unconjugated bilirubin. This occurs via microbial β-glucuronidase-mediated conversion of bilirubin conjugates. Metagenomic analysis of faecal samples from patients with post-infection IBS (n = 52) revealed an altered gut microbiota composition, in particular a reduction in Alistipes taxa, and high gut proteolytic activity driven by specific host serine proteases compared with controls. Germ-free mice showed 10-fold higher proteolytic activity compared with conventional mice. Colonization with microbiota samples from high proteolytic activity IBS patients failed to suppress proteolytic activity in germ-free mice, but suppression of proteolytic activity was achieved with colonization using microbiota from healthy donors. High proteolytic activity mice had higher intestinal permeability, a higher relative abundance of Bacteroides and a reduction in Alistipes taxa compared with low proteolytic activity mice. High proteolytic activity IBS patients had lower fecal β-glucuronidase activity and end-products of bilirubin deconjugation. Mice treated with unconjugated bilirubin and β-glucuronidase-overexpressing E. coli significantly reduced proteolytic activity, while inhibitors of microbial β-glucuronidases increased proteolytic activity. Together, these data define a disease-relevant mechanism of host-microbial interaction that maintains protease homoeostasis in the gut.

## Communication between the gut microbiota and peripheral nervous system in health and chronic disease.
 02.05.2022, _TM Cook, V Mansuy-Aubert_


_Chronic Disease, Diet, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Gastrointestinal Tract, Humans, Peripheral Nervous System_
Trillions of bacteria reside within our gastrointestinal tract, ideally forming a mutually beneficial relationship between us. However, persistent changes in diet and lifestyle in the western diet and lifestyle contribute to a damaging of the gut microbiota-host symbiosis leading to diseases such as obesity and irritable bowel syndrome. Many symptoms and comorbidities associated with these diseases stem from dysfunctional signaling in peripheral neurons. Our peripheral nervous system (PNS) is comprised of a variety of sensory, autonomic, and enteric neurons which coordinate key homeostatic functions such as gastrointestinal motility, digestion, immunity, feeding behavior, glucose and lipid homeostasis, and more. The composition and signaling of bacteria in our gut dramatically influences how our peripheral neurons regulate these functions, and we are just beginning to uncover the molecular mechanisms mediating this communication. In this review, we cover the general anatomy and function of the PNS, and then we discuss how the molecules secreted or stimulated by gut microbes signal through the PNS to alter host development and physiology. Finally, we discuss how leveraging the power of our gut microbes on peripheral nervous system signaling may offer effective therapies to counteract the rise in chronic diseases crippling the western world.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly efficacious procedure used most commonly for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Despite the high value of incorporating FMT into practice, there remain concerns about its safety. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been an updated meta-analysis reporting pooled rates of adverse events in FMT for CDI.

## Eco-evolutionary impact of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure on microorganisms, with a special focus on our skin microbiome.
 02.05.2022, _S Rai, G Rai, A Kumar_


Sunlight is pivotal for our survival, and daily UV exposure has impacted the evolutionary course of all forms of life, from microorganisms to humans. Deciphering the role of UVR in regulating the microbial dynamics of environmental and host-associated microbes is crucial. UVR may be responsible for affecting skin pathology by influencing the skin microbiome, both qualitatively and quantitatively, as evident in low-dose narrow-band UVB phototherapy. Some findings have suggested that the skin microbiome has immunomodulatory roles when exposed to UVR; however, its involvement in UV screening or protection has yet to be fully explored. Furthermore, numerous skin disorders are associated not only with an altered skin microbiome but also with an altered gut microbiome. Hence, the skin-gut axis needs to be in physiological homeostasis and immunological harmony. The purpose of this review is to examine the impact of natural UVR on human immunomodulatory mechanisms and the associated cutaneous microbiome, with an emphasis on interactions among UVR, skin homeostasis, vitamin D, and the related skin-gut axis. With the 'nature as an inspiration' approach, ongoing research is trying to decipher photoprotective secrets in several microbial-based natural compounds to be used as sunscreens or other topical formulations. In addition, various probiotics have also been shown to have significant antioxidant, antiwrinkle, and antiaging effects that ameliorate UV-induced cellular and molecular damage, as highlighted in the review. These cosmetics, nutricosmetics, and probiotaceuticals will undoubtedly be next-generation solutions against photoaging and maintaining skin health.

## The huge clinical potential of microbiota in the treatment of pancreatic cancer: The next frontier.
 02.05.2022, _Z Zhang, D Tang_


Microbes and their metabolites are found in all body organs; their interaction with body organs can influence inflammation, immunity, and cancer development. Pancreatic cancer development is closely related to intestinal, intrapancreatic, and oral flora. The microbiota plays a regulatory role in pancreatic cancer's malignant progression and treatment resistance. Thus, the study of microbiota-host interactions has emerged as a new hot topic in pancreatic cancer treatment, with microbiota control demonstrating significant clinical potential. This review summarizes recent advances in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer, emphasizing the enormous potential for operating microbiota in pancreatic cancer treatment.

## ABO genotype alters the gut microbiota by regulating GalNAc levels in pigs.

The composition of the intestinal microbiome varies considerably between individuals and is correlated with health1. Understanding to what extend and how host genetics contributes to this variation is paramount yet has proven difficult as few associations have been replicated, particularly in humans2. We herein study the effect of host genotype on the composition of the intestinal microbiota in a large mosaic pig population. We show that, under conditions of exacerbated genetic diversity and environmental uniformity, microbiota composition and abundance of specific taxa are heritable. We map a quantitative trait locus affecting the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae species and show that it is caused by a 2.3-Kb deletion in the N-acetyl-galactosaminyl-transferase gene underpinning the ABO blood group in humans. We show that this deletion is a ≥3.5 million years old trans-species polymorphism under balancing selection. We demonstrate that it decreases the concentrations of N-acetyl-galactosamine in the gut thereby reducing the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae that can import and catabolize N-acetyl-galactosamine. Our results provide very strong evidence for an effect of host genotype on the abundance of specific bacteria in the intestine combined with insights in the molecular mechanisms that underpin this association. They pave the way towards identifying the same effect in human rural populations.

## External light-dark cycle shapes gut microbiota through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.
 27.04.2022, _CC Lee, F Liang, IC Lee, TH Lu, YY Shan, CF Jeng, YF Zou, HT Yu, SK Chen Alen_


Gut microbiota are involved in many physiological functions such as metabolism, brain development, and neurodegenerative diseases. Many microbes in the digestive tract do not maintain a constant level of their relative abundance but show daily oscillations under normal conditions. Recent evidence indicates that chronic jetlag, constant darkness, or deletion of the circadian core gene can alter the composition of gut microbiota and dampen the daily oscillation of gut microbes. However, the neuronal circuit responsible for modulating gut microbiota remained unclear. Using genetic mouse models and 16s rRNA metagenomic analysis, we find that light-dark cycle information transmitted by the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) is essential for daily oscillations of gut microbes under temporal restricted high-fat diet conditions. Furthermore, aberrant light exposure such as dim light at night (dLAN) can alter the composition, relative abundance, and daily oscillations of gut microbiota. Together, our results indicate that external light-dark cycle information can modulate gut microbiota in the direction from the brain to the gut via the sensory system.

## Could Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and Inclusion of Diet-Gut Microbiome Interactions Improve Disease Risk Prediction? Case Study: Coronary Artery Disease.
 30.04.2022, _B Vilne, J Ķibilds, I Siksna, I Lazda, O Valciņa, A Krūmiņa_


Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the main leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, posing a huge socio-economic burden to the society and health systems. Therefore, timely and precise identification of people at high risk of CAD is urgently required. Most current CAD risk prediction approaches are based on a small number of traditional risk factors (age, sex, diabetes, LDL and HDL cholesterol, smoking, systolic blood pressure) and are incompletely predictive across all patient groups, as CAD is a multi-factorial disease with complex etiology, considered to be driven by both genetic, as well as numerous environmental/lifestyle factors. Diet is one of the modifiable factors for improving lifestyle and disease prevention. However, the current rise in obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CVD/CAD indicates that the "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be efficient, due to significant variation in inter-individual responses. Recently, the gut microbiome has emerged as a potential and previously under-explored contributor to these variations. Hence, efficient integration of dietary and gut microbiome information alongside with genetic variations and clinical data holds a great promise to improve CAD risk prediction. Nevertheless, the highly complex nature of meals combined with the huge inter-individual variability of the gut microbiome poses several Big Data analytics challenges in modeling diet-gut microbiota interactions and integrating these within CAD risk prediction approaches for the development of personalized decision support systems (DSS). In this regard, the recent re-emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) is opening intriguing perspectives, as these approaches are able to capture large and complex matrices of data, incorporating their interactions and identifying both linear and non-linear relationships. In this Mini-Review, we consider (1) the most used AI/ML approaches and their different use cases for CAD risk prediction (2) modeling of the content, choice and impact of dietary factors on CAD risk; (3) classification of individuals by their gut microbiome composition into CAD cases vs. controls and (4) modeling of the diet-gut microbiome interactions and their impact on CAD risk. Finally, we provide an outlook for putting it all together for improved CAD risk predictions.

## Microbial dark matter: from discovery to applications.
 27.04.2022, _Y Zha, H Chong, P Yang, K Ning_


With the rapid increase of the microbiome samples and sequencing data, more and more knowledge about microbial communities has been gained. However, there is still much more to learn about microbial communities, including billions of novel species and genes, as well as countless spatiotemporal dynamic patterns within the microbial communities, which together form the microbial dark matter. In this work, we summarized the dark matter in microbiome research and reviewed current data mining methods, especially artificial intelligence (AI) methods, for different types of knowledge discovery from microbial dark matter. We also provided case studies on using AI methods for microbiome data mining and knowledge discovery. In summary, we view microbial dark matter not as a problem to be solved but as an opportunity for AI methods to explore, with the goal of advancing our understanding of microbial communities, as well as developing better solutions to global concerns about human health and the environment.
