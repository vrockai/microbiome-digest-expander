## Blood type and the microbiome- untangling a complex relationship with lessons from pathogens.
 16.07.2020, _KL Arnolds, CG Martin, CA Lozupone_


The complex communities of microbes that constitute the human microbiome are influenced by host and environmental factors. Here, we address how a fundamental aspect of human biology, blood type, contributes to shaping this microscopic ecosystem. Although this question remains largely unexplored, we glean insights from decades of work describing relationships between pathogens and blood type. The bacterial strategies, molecular mechanisms, and host responses that shaped those relationships may parallel those that characterize how blood type and commensals interact. Understanding these nuanced interactions will expand our capacity to analyze and manipulate the human microbiome.

## Proteomic advances in salivary diagnostics.
 14.07.2020, _E Pappa, K Vougas, J Zoidakis, H Vastardis_


Saliva is identified as functional equivalent to serum, reflecting the physiological state of the body, as well as hormonal, emotional, nutritional and metabolic alterations. The application of mass spectrometry based approaches has allowed a thorough characterization of the saliva proteome and led to the discovery of putative biomarkers. Several salivary biomarkers have been recently explored as potentially useful screening tools in patients diagnosed with metabolic disorders. In this review, we provide an overview of saliva proteomics studies, with a focus on diabetes, and we explore the evidence for the utility of well identified markers for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. Emerging approaches in salivary diagnostics that may significantly advance the field of diabetes research are also highlighted.

Most patients diagnosed with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) survive less than 5 years, but a minor subset survives longer. Here, we dissect the role of the tumor microbiota and the immune system in influencing long-term survival. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the tumor microbiome composition in PDAC patients with short-term survival (STS) and long-term survival (LTS). We found higher alpha-diversity in the tumor microbiome of LTS patients and identified an intra-tumoral microbiome signature (Pseudoxanthomonas-Streptomyces-Saccharopolyspora-Bacillus clausii) highly predictive of long-term survivorship in both discovery and validation cohorts. Through human-into-mice fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments from STS, LTS, or control donors, we were able to differentially modulate the tumor microbiome and affect tumor growth as well as tumor immune infiltration. Our study demonstrates that PDAC microbiome composition, which cross-talks to the gut microbiome, influences the host immune response and natural history of the disease.
