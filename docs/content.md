Nuclear compartments have diverse roles in regulating gene expression, yet the molecular forces and components that drive compartment formation remain largely unclear1. The long non-coding RNA Xist establishes an intra-chromosomal compartment by localizing at a high concentration in a territory spatially close to its transcription locus2 and binding diverse proteins3-5 to achieve X-chromosome inactivation (XCI)6,7. The XCI process therefore serves as a paradigm for understanding how RNA-mediated recruitment of various proteins induces a functional compartment. The properties of the inactive X (Xi)-compartment are known to change over time, because after initial Xist spreading and transcriptional shutoff a state is reached in which gene silencing remains stable even if Xist is turned off8. Here we show that the Xist RNA-binding proteins PTBP19, MATR310, TDP-4311 and CELF112 assemble on the multivalent E-repeat element of Xist7 and, via self-aggregation and heterotypic protein-protein interactions, form a condensate1 in the Xi. This condensate is required for gene silencing and for the anchoring of Xist to the Xi territory, and can be sustained in the absence of Xist. Notably, these E-repeat-binding proteins become essential coincident with transition to the Xist-independent XCI phase8, indicating that the condensate seeded by the E-repeat underlies the developmental switch from Xist-dependence to Xist-independence. Taken together, our data show that Xist forms the Xi compartment by seeding a heteromeric condensate that consists of ubiquitous RNA-binding proteins, revealing an unanticipated mechanism for heritable gene silencing.

Dissemination of results to research participants is largely missing from the practices of most researchers. Few resources exist that describe best practices for disseminating information to this important stakeholder group.

## In vivo antiviral host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 by viral load, sex, and age.

Despite limited genomic diversity, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with up-regulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3 and T helper type 1 (Th1) chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response 7 days post infection, with no induction of interferon-stimulated genes after 3 days. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of the Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and their cognate receptor CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B cell-specific and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.

## Ecology and genomics of Actinobacteria: new concepts for natural product discovery.
 11.09.2020, _DA van Bergeijk, BR Terlouw, MH Medema, GP van Wezel_


Actinobacteria constitute a highly diverse bacterial phylum with an unrivalled metabolic versatility. They produce most of the clinically used antibiotics and a plethora of other natural products with medical or agricultural applications. Modern 'omics'-based technologies have revealed that the genomic potential of Actinobacteria greatly outmatches the known chemical space. In this Review, we argue that combining insights into actinobacterial ecology with state-of-the-art computational approaches holds great promise to unlock this unexplored reservoir of actinobacterial metabolism. This enables the identification of small molecules and other stimuli that elicit the induction of poorly expressed biosynthetic gene clusters, which should help reinvigorate screening efforts for their precious bioactive natural products.

## A comprehensive and comparative study on the action of pentacyclic triterpenoids on Vibrio cholerae biofilms.
 11.09.2020, _SP Bhattacharya, A Bhattacharya, A Sen_


While serving as environmental reservoir for V. cholerae infection, biofilms are also crucial for intestinal colonization of the pathogen. Triterpenoids, a group of bioactive phytochemicals, have been tested for antibiofilm activity against model biofilm forming bacteria in recent times. In this context, glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA), ursolic acid (UA) and betulinic acid (BA), representing three categorically distinct groups of pentacyclic triterpenoids, are targeted for profiling their impact on Vibrio cholerae C6709 biofilms. The triterpenoids substantially affected biofilm associated attributes like formation, substratum adherence and dispersion from preformed biofilms. Though at variable degree, the compounds decreased cell surface hydrophobicity and composition in terms of macromolecular content. Not only EPS-associated extracellular enzyme activities were estimated to be reduced by triterpenoid exposure, ultra structural analysis also revealed that GRA, UA and BA can affect extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content. Albeit total extracellular proteolytic activity remained unaffected by the triterpenoids, GRA treatment resulted in considerable reduction of extracellular gelatinase activity. Molecular docking analysis indicated potential interaction with cyclic di-GMP sensor VpsT, autoinducer-2 sensor kinase LuxP-LuxQ and transcriptional activator HapR, components of complex quorum sensing networks modulating biofilm formation. Comprehensive analysis of antibiotic action revealed accentuation of cephalosporin antibiotics with GRA and UA while BA potentiated action of fluoroquinolones against biofilmed bacteria, widening the scope of combinatorial therapeutic strategy.
