 11.11.2020, _DA Leach, J Chen, L Yang, HK Chua, MRS Walther-António, JA Occhino_


Growing literature details the critical importance of the microbiome in the modulation of human health and disease including both the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems. Rectovaginal fistulae (RVF) are notoriously difficult to manage, many requiring multiple attempts at repair before correction is achieved. RVF involves two distinct microbiome communities whose characteristics and potential interplay have not been previously characterized and may influence surgical success.

## Porphyromonas gingivalis promotes tumor progression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
 17.11.2020, _MF Chen, MS Lu, CC Hsieh, WC Chen_


Increasing evidence indicates that the microbiome may influence tumor growth and modulate the tumor microenvironment of gastrointestinal cancers. However, the role of oral bacteria in the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (EsoSCC) has remained unclear. Herein, we investigated the relationship between the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis and EsoSCC.

## Shotgun sequencing of the vaginal microbiome reveals both a species and functional potential signature of preterm birth.
 13.11.2020, _C Feehily, D Crosby, CJ Walsh, EM Lawton, S Higgins, FM McAuliffe, PD Cotter_


An association between the vaginal microbiota and preterm birth (PTB) has been reported in several research studies. Population shifts from high proportions of lactobacilli to mixed species communities, as seen with bacterial vaginosis, have been linked to a twofold increased risk of PTB. Despite the increasing number of studies using next-generation sequencing technologies, primarily involving 16S rRNA-based approaches, to investigate the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy, no distinct microbial signature has been associated with PTB. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing offers a powerful tool to reveal community structures and their gene functions at a far greater resolution than amplicon sequencing. In this study, we employ shotgun metagenomic sequencing to compare the vaginal microbiota of women at high risk of preterm birth (n = 35) vs. a low-risk control group (n = 14). Although microbial diversity and richness did not differ between groups, there were significant differences in terms of individual species. In particular, Lactobacillus crispatus was associated with samples from a full-term pregnancy, whereas one community state-type was associated with samples from preterm pregnancies. Furthermore, by predicting gene functions, the functional potential of the preterm microbiota was different from that of full-term equivalent. Taken together, we observed a discrete structural and functional difference in the microbial composition of the vagina in women who deliver preterm. Importance: with an estimated 15 million cases annually, spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of death in infants under the age of five years. The ability to accurately identify pregnancies at risk of spontaneous PTB is therefore of utmost importance. However, no single cause is attributable. Microbial infection is a known risk factor, yet the role of vaginal microbes is poorly understood. Using high-resolution DNA-sequencing techniques, we investigate the microbial communities present in the vaginal tracts of women deemed high risk for PTB. We confirm that Lactobacillus crispatus is strongly linked to full-term pregnancies, whereas other microbial communities associate with PTB. Importantly, we show that the specific functions of the microbes present in PTB samples differs from FTB samples, highlighting the power of our sequencing approach. This information enables us to begin understanding the specific microbial traits that may be influencing PTB, beyond the presence or absence of microbial taxa.

## IBDs and the pediatric age: Their peculiarities and the involvement of the microbiota.
 15.11.2020, _L Cococcioni, S Panelli, I Varotto-Boccazzi, DD Carlo, D Pistone, G Leccese, GV Zuccotti, F Comandatore_


Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) are gastrointestinal disorders characterized by chronic, relapsing inflammation, with growing incidence worldwide over the last decades and distinctive features in the pediatric age. An increasing body of evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays a major role in inflammatory disorders, including IBDs. In this review we will discuss the most recent evidences on dysbiotic changes associated with gut inflammation, as well as environmental and genetic factors contributing to IBD pathogenesis, with a focus on the peculiarities of the pediatric age.

## Species-dependent variation of the gut bacterial communities across Trypanosoma cruzi insect vectors.
 12.11.2020, _LM Arias-Giraldo, M Muñoz, C Hernández, G Herrera, N Velásquez-Ortiz, O Cantillo-Barraza, P Urbano, JD Ramírez_


Triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) are the insect vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The gut bacterial communities affect the development of T. cruzi inside the vector, making the characterization of its composition important in the understanding of infection development. We collected 54 triatomine bugs corresponding to four genera in different departments of Colombia. DNA extraction and PCR were performed to evaluate T. cruzi presence and to determine the discrete typing unit (DTU) of the parasite. PCR products of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were pooled and sequenced. Resulting reads were denoised and QIIME 2 was used for the identification of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Diversity (alpha and beta diversity) and richness analyses, Circos plots, and principal component analysis (PCA) were also performed. The overall T. cruzi infection frequency was 75.9%, with TcI being the predominant DTU. Approximately 500,000 sequences were analyzed and 27 bacterial phyla were identified. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria (33.9%), Actinobacteria (32.4%), Firmicutes (19.6%), and Bacteroidetes (7.6%), which together accounted for over 90% of the gut communities identified in this study. Genera were identified for these main bacterial phyla, revealing the presence of important bacteria such as Rhodococcus, Serratia, and Wolbachia. The composition of bacterial phyla in the gut of the insects was significantly different between triatomine species, whereas no significant difference was seen between the state of T. cruzi infection. We suggest further investigation with the evaluation of additional variables and a larger sample size. To our knowledge, this study is the first characterization of the gut bacterial structure of the main triatomine genera in Colombia.

Microbial translocation (MT) and altered gut microbiota have been described in acute leukemic patients and contribute to immune activation and inflammation. However, phage translocation has not been investigated in leukemia patients yet. We recruited 44 leukemic patients and 52 healthy adults and quantified the levels of 3 phages in peripheral blood, which were the most positive phages screened from fecal samples. The content of 16S rRNA in plasma was detected by qPCR to assess the intestinal mucosa of these patients. Spearman's rank correlation was used to analyze the relationship between phage load and the relevant clinical data. We found the most prevalent phages in fecal samples were λ phage, Wphi phage, and P22 phage, and λ phage had the highest detection rate in plasma (68%). Phage content was affected by chemotherapy and course of disease and correlated with the levels of CRP (r = 0.43, p = 0.003), sCD14 (r = 0.37, p = 0.014), and sCD163 (r = 0.44, p = 0.003). Our data indicate that plasma phage load is a promising marker for gut barrier damage and that gut phage translocation correlates with monocyte/macrophage activation and systemic inflammatory response in leukemic patients.

## Unravelling the importance of the eukaryotic and bacterial communities and their relationship with Legionella spp. ecology in cooling towers: a complex network.
 13.11.2020, _K Paranjape, É Bédard, D Shetty, M Hu, FCP Choon, M Prévost, SP Faucher_


Cooling towers are a major source of large community-associated outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease, a severe pneumonia. This disease is contracted when inhaling aerosols that are contaminated with bacteria from the genus Legionella, most importantly Legionella pneumophila. How cooling towers support the growth of this bacterium is still not well understood. As Legionella species are intracellular parasites of protozoa, it is assumed that protozoan community in cooling towers play an important role in Legionella ecology and outbreaks. However, the exact mechanism of how the eukaryotic community contributes to Legionella ecology is still unclear. Therefore, we used 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the eukaryotic communities of 18 different cooling towers. The data from the eukaryotic community was then analysed with the bacterial community of the same towers in order to understand how each community could affect Legionella spp. ecology in cooling towers.

## Transductomics: sequencing-based detection and analysis of transduced DNA in pure cultures and microbial communities.
 16.11.2020, _M Kleiner, B Bushnell, KE Sanderson, LV Hooper, BA Duerkop_


Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays a central role in microbial evolution. Our understanding of the mechanisms, frequency, and taxonomic range of HGT in polymicrobial environments is limited, as we currently rely on historical HGT events inferred from genome sequencing and studies involving cultured microorganisms. We lack approaches to observe ongoing HGT in microbial communities.
