Metagenomic assembly enables new organism discovery from microbial communities, but it can only capture few abundant organisms from most metagenomes. Here we present MetaPhlAn 4, which integrates information from metagenome assemblies and microbial isolate genomes for more comprehensive metagenomic taxonomic profiling. From a curated collection of 1.01 M prokaryotic reference and metagenome-assembled genomes, we define unique marker genes for 26,970 species-level genome bins, 4,992 of them taxonomically unidentified at the species level. MetaPhlAn 4 explains ~20% more reads in most international human gut microbiomes and &gt;40% in less-characterized environments such as the rumen microbiome and proves more accurate than available alternatives on synthetic evaluations while also reliably quantifying organisms with no cultured isolates. Application of the method to &gt;24,500 metagenomes highlights previously undetected species to be strong biomarkers for host conditions and lifestyles in human and mouse microbiomes and shows that even previously uncharacterized species can be genetically profiled at the resolution of single microbial strains.

## Gut microbial metabolism of 5-ASA diminishes its clinical efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease.

For decades, variability in clinical efficacy of the widely used inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) drug 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) has been attributed, in part, to its acetylation and inactivation by gut microbes. Identification of the responsible microbes and enzyme(s), however, has proved elusive. To uncover the source of this metabolism, we developed a multi-omics workflow combining gut microbiome metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics from the longitudinal IBDMDB cohort of 132 controls and patients with IBD. This associated 12 previously uncharacterized microbial acetyltransferases with 5-ASA inactivation, belonging to two protein superfamilies: thiolases and acyl-CoA N-acyltransferases. In vitro characterization of representatives from both families confirmed the ability of these enzymes to acetylate 5-ASA. A cross-sectional analysis within the discovery cohort and subsequent prospective validation within the independent SPARC IBD cohort (n = 208) found three of these microbial thiolases and one acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase to be epidemiologically associated with an increased risk of treatment failure among 5-ASA users. Together, these data address a longstanding challenge in IBD management, outline a method for the discovery of previously uncharacterized gut microbial activities and advance the possibility of microbiome-based personalized medicine.

Viruses are increasingly recognised as important components of the human microbiome, fulfilling numerous ecological roles including bacterial predation, immune stimulation, genetic diversification, horizontal gene transfer, microbial interactions, and augmentation of metabolic functions. However, our current view of the human gut virome is tainted by previous sequencing requirements that necessitated the amplification of starting nucleic acids. In this study, we performed an original longitudinal analysis of 40 healthy control, 19 Crohn's disease, and 20 ulcerative colitis viromes over three time points without an amplification bias, which revealed and highlighted the interpersonal individuality of the human gut virome. In contrast to a 16 S rRNA gene analysis of matched samples, we show that α- and β-diversity metrics of unamplified viromes are not as efficient at discerning controls from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, we explored the intrinsic properties of unamplified gut viromes and show there is considerable interpersonal variability in viral taxa, infrequent longitudinal persistence of intrapersonal viruses, and vast fluctuations in the abundance of temporal viruses. Together, these properties of unamplified faecal viromes confound the ability to discern disease associations but significantly advance toward an unbiased and accurate representation of the human gut virome.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) remains underestimated in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This study aims to describe clinical features and outcomes of IPA in CAP patients, assess diagnostic performance of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for IPA and analyse lung microbiome via mNGS data.

## Comparing the gut microbiome of obese, African American, older adults with and without mild cognitive impairment.

Those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia, have a gut microbiome distinct from healthy individuals, but this has only been shown in healthy individuals, not in those exhibiting several risk factors for dementia. Using amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing in a case-control study of 60 older (ages 55-76), obese, predominately female, African American adults, those with MCI (cases) had different gut microbiota profiles than controls. While microbial community diversity was similar between cases and controls, the abundances of specific microbial taxa weren't, such as Parabacteroides distasonis (lower in cases) and Dialister invisus (higher in cases). These differences disappeared after adjusting for markers of oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. Cognitive scores were positively correlated with levels of Akkermansia muciniphila, a bacterium associated with reduced inflammation. Our study shows that gut microbial composition may be associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and MCI in those at high risk for dementia.
