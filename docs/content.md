 23.01.2024, _X Chen, J Wei, Y Zhang, Y Zhang, T Zhang_


HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) has become a chronic neurodegenerative disease affecting the quality of life in people living with HIV (PLWH). Despite an established association between HAND and neuroinflammation induced by HIV proteins (gp120, Tat, Rev., Nef, and Vpr), the pathogenesis of HAND remains to be fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that the gut microbiome is emerging as a critical regulator of various neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease), suggesting that the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and neuroinflammation may contribute to the development of these diseases, for example, gut dysbiosis and microbiota-derived metabolites can trigger inflammation in the brain. However, the potential role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of HAND remains largely unexplored. In this review, we aim to discuss and elucidate the HAND pathogenesis correlated with gut microbiome and neuroinflammation, and intend to explore the probable intervention strategies for HAND.

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial barrier function. Although multiple studies have demonstrated the significance of dietary factors on gut microbiota and mucosal barrier function, the impact of a purified diet, which has long been used in various animal experiments, on intestinal homeostasis remains to be elucidated. Here, we compared the impact of two different types of diets, a crude diet and an AIN-93G-formula purified diet, on epithelial integrity and the gut microbiota. Purified diet-fed mice exhibited shorter villi and crypt lengths and slower epithelial turnover, particularly in the ileum. In addition, antimicrobial products, including islet-derived protein 3γ (REG3γ), were substantially decreased in purified diet-fed mice. Purified diet feeding also suppressed α1,2-fucosylation on the epithelial surface. Furthermore, purified diet induced metabolic rewiring to fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the ileal contents and mucus layer revealed distinct gut microbiota compositions between the purified and crude diet-fed mice. Purified diet feeding reduced the abundance of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which potently upregulate REG3γ and fucosyltransferase 2 (Fut2) by stimulating group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) to produce IL-22. These observations illustrate that the intake of a crude diet secures epithelial barrier function by facilitating SFB colonization, whereas a purified diet insufficiently establishes the epithelial barrier, at least partly owing to the loss of SFB. Our data suggest that the influence of purified diets on the epithelial barrier integrity should be considered in experiments using purified diets.

The human gut microbiome contributes to a broad range of biochemical and metabolic functions that directly or indirectly affect human physiology. Several recent studies have indicated that factors like age, geographical location, genetic makeup, and individual health status significantly influence the diversity, stability, and resilience of the gut microbiome. Of the mentioned factors, geographical location (and related dietary/socio-economic context) appears to explain a significant portion of microbiome variation observed in various previously conducted base-line studies on human gut microbiome. Given this context, we have undertaken a microbiome study with the objective of cataloguing the taxonomic diversity of gut microbiomes sampled from an urban cohort from Ahmedabad city in Western India. Computational analysis of microbiome sequence data corresponding to 160 stool samples (collected from 80 healthy individuals at two time-points, 60 days apart) has indicated a Prevotella-dominated microbial community. Given that the typical diet of participants included carbohydrate and fibre-rich components (predominantly whole grains and legume-based preparations), results appear to validate the proposed correlation between diet/geography and microbiome composition. Comparative analysis of obtained gut microbiome profiles with previously published microbiome profiles from US, China, Finland, and Japan additionally reveals a distinct taxonomic and (inferred) functional niche for the sampled microbiomes.

Recent research increasingly highlights a strong correlation between gut microbiota and the risk of gastrointestinal diseases. However, whether this relationship is causal or merely coincidental remains uncertain. To address this, a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was undertaken to explore the connections between gut microbiota and prevalent gastrointestinal diseases.

## Psychological stress-induced microbial metabolite indole-3-acetate disrupts intestinal cell lineage commitment.
 24.01.2024, _W Wei, Y Liu, Y Hou, S Cao, Z Chen, Y Zhang, X Cai, Q Yan, Z Li, Y Yuan, G Wang, X Zheng, H Hao_


The brain and gut are intricately connected and respond to various stimuli. Stress-induced brain-gut communication is implicated in the pathogenesis and relapse of gut disorders. The mechanism that relays psychological stress to the intestinal epithelium, resulting in maladaptation, remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a stress-responsive brain-to-gut metabolic axis that impairs intestinal stem cell (ISC) lineage commitment. Psychological stress-triggered sympathetic output enriches gut commensal Lactobacillus murinus, increasing the production of indole-3-acetate (IAA), which contributes to a transferrable loss of intestinal secretory cells. Bacterial IAA disrupts ISC mitochondrial bioenergetics and thereby prevents secretory lineage commitment in a cell-intrinsic manner. Oral α-ketoglutarate supplementation bolsters ISC differentiation and confers resilience to stress-triggered intestinal epithelial injury. We confirm that fecal IAA is higher in patients with mental distress and is correlated with gut dysfunction. These findings uncover a microbe-mediated brain-gut pathway that could be therapeutically targeted for stress-driven gut-brain comorbidities.

The microbiome is known to play key roles in health and disease, including host susceptibility to parasite infections. The freshwater snail Galba truncatula is the intermediate host for many trematode species, including the liver and rumen flukes Fasciola hepatica and Calicophoron daubneyi, respectively. The snail-parasite system has previously been investigated. However, the specific interaction between the snail-associated microbiota and intra-snail developmental stages of trematodes has yet to be explored.

Fonio (Digitaria exilis), an orphan millet crop, is the oldest indigenous crop in West Africa. Although the yield is low due to pre-domestication characteristics, the quick maturation time, drought tolerance, and the ability to thrive on poor soils make fonio a climate-smart crop. Being holobionts, plants evolve in close interaction with microbial partners, which is crucial for plant phenology and fitness. As seeds are the bottleneck of vertically transmitting plant microbiota, we proposed to unravel the seed microbiome of the under-domesticated and resilient crop fonio. Our study investigated the bacterial seed endophyte diversity across 126 sequenced fonio accessions from distinct locations in West Africa. We conducted a correlation study of the structures and functions of the seed-associated microbiomes with the native geo-climate and soil structure data. We also performed Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic loci associated with seed endophyte diversity.

Plant microbiomes play crucial roles in nutrient cycling and plant growth, and are shaped by a complex interplay between plants, microbes, and the environment. The role of bacteria as mediators of the 400-million-year-old partnership between the majority of land plants and, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is still poorly understood. Here, we test whether AM hyphae-associated bacteria influence the success of the AM symbiosis.

## VLP-Based Model for Study of Airborne Viral Pathogens.
 23.01.2024, _M Caffrey, N Jayakumar, V Caffrey, V Anirudan, L Rong, I Paprotny_


The recent COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the danger of airborne viral pathogens. The lack of model systems to study airborne pathogens limits the understanding of airborne pathogen distribution, as well as potential surveillance and mitigation strategies. In this work, we develop a novel model system to study airborne pathogens using virus like particles (VLP). Specifically, we demonstrate the ability to aerosolize VLP and detect and quantify aerosolized VLP RNA by Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) in real-time fluorescent and colorimetric assays. Importantly, the VLP model presents many advantages for the study of airborne viral pathogens: (i) similarity in size and surface components; (ii) ease of generation and noninfectious nature enabling study of BSL3 and BSL4 viruses; (iii) facile characterization of aerosolization parameters; (iv) ability to adapt the system to other viral envelope proteins including those of newly discovered pathogens and mutant variants; (v) the ability to introduce viral sequences to develop nucleic acid amplification assays.

## Microbiome-based correction for random errors in nutrient profiles derived from self-reported dietary assessments.
 28.01.2024, _T Wang, Y Fu, M Shuai, JS Zheng, L Zhu, AT Chan, Q Sun, FB Hu, ST Weiss, YY Liu_


Since dietary intake is challenging to directly measure in large-scale cohort studies, we often rely on self-reported instruments (e.g., food frequency questionnaires, 24-hour recalls, and diet records) developed in nutritional epidemiology. Those self-reported instruments are prone to measurement errors, which can lead to inaccuracies in the calculation of nutrient profiles. Currently, few computational methods exist to address this problem. In the present study, we introduce a deep-learning approach --- Microbiome-based nutrient profile corrector (METRIC), which leverages gut microbial compositions to correct random errors in self-reported dietary assessments using 24-hour recalls or diet records. We demonstrate the excellent performance of METRIC in minimizing the simulated random errors, particularly for nutrients metabolized by gut bacteria in both synthetic and three real-world datasets. Further research is warranted to examine the utility of METRIC to correct actual measurement errors in self-reported dietary assessment instruments.
