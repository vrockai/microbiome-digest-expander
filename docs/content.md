## Cross-Scale Analyses of Animal and Human Gut Microbiome Assemblies from Metacommunity to Global Landscape.
 06.07.2021, _ZS Ma_


Animal (human) gut microbiomes have been coevolving with their hosts for many millions of years. Understanding how the coevolution shapes the processes of microbiome assembly and diversity maintenance is important but rather challenging. An effort may start with the understanding of how and why animals and humans may differ in their microbiome neutrality (stochasticity) levels. Here, we attempted to perform layered comparative stochasticity analyses across animal species (including humans), class, and kingdom scales, corresponding to microbial metacommunity, landscape, and global-landscape scales. By analyzing 4,903 microbiome samples from 274 animal species covering 4 major invertebrate classes and all 6 vertebrate classes and including 1,787 human gut microbiome samples, we discovered the following: (i) at the microbial metacommunity (animal species) scale, although the general trend of stochasticity (measured in the relationships between fundamental biodiversity/dispersal numbers of Hubbell's neutral theory and host species phylogenetic timeline) seems continuous, there seems to be a turning point from animals to humans in the passing rate of neutrality tests (12% to 45% versus 100%). We postulate that it should be the human experiences from agricultural/industrial activities (e.g., diet effects) and frequent social/familial contacts that are responsible for the dramatically rising stochastic neutrality in human gut microbiomes. (ii) At the microbial landscape (animal class) and global landscape (animal kingdom) scales, neutrality is not detectable, suggesting that the landscape is niche differentiated-animal species may possess "home niches" for their coadapted microbiomes. We further analyze the reliabilities of our findings by using variable P value thresholds (type I error) and performing power analysis (type II error) of neutrality tests. IMPORTANCE Understanding how the coevolution (evolutionary time scale) and/or the interactions (ecological time scale) between animal (human) gut microbiomes and their hosts shape the processes of the microbiome assembly and diversity maintenance is important but rather challenging. An effort may start with the understanding of how and why animals and humans may differ in their microbiome neutrality (stochasticity) levels. Here, we attempted to perform layered comparative stochasticity analyses across animal species (including humans), class, and kingdom scales, corresponding to microbial metacommunity, landscape, and global-landscape scales by analyzing 4,903 microbiome samples from 274 animal species covering 4 major invertebrate classes and all 6 vertebrate classes, and including 1,787 human gut microbiome samples. The analyses were implemented by fitting the multisite neutral model and further augmented by checking false-positive and false-negative errors, respectively. It appears that there is a turning (tipping) point in the neutrality level from animal to human microbiomes.

## Microbiota long-term dynamics and prediction of acute graft-versus-host disease in pediatric allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
 02.07.2021, _AC Ingham, K Kielsen, H Mordhorst, M Ifversen, FM Aarestrup, KG Müller, SJ Pamp_


Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) exhibit changes in their gut microbiota and are experiencing a range of complications, including acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). It is unknown if, when, and under which conditions a re-establishment of microbial and immunological homeostasis occurs. It is also unclear whether microbiota long-term dynamics occur at other body sites than the gut such as the mouth or nose. Moreover, it is not known whether the patients' microbiota prior to HSCT holds clues to whether the patient would suffer from severe complications subsequent to HSCT. Here, we take a holobiont perspective and performed an integrated host-microbiota analysis of the gut, oral, and nasal microbiota in 29 children undergoing allo-HSCT.

## The Interplay between fasting, gut microbiota, and lipid profile.
 06.07.2021, _A Mohammadzadeh, N Roshanravan, N Mesri Alamdari, A Safaiyan, E Mosharkesh, A Hadi, M Barati, A Ostadrahimi_


This study aimed to investigate the consequence of Ramadan fasting on gut bacterium (Bacteroides and Firmicutes), serum concentration for butyrate, and lipid profile. Thirty healthy subjects were enlisted and investigated two times (before and at the end of Ramadan). Fasting blood samples were obtained for measuring fasting blood sugar (FBS) and lipid profile and serum butyrate concentration. Anthropometrics variables were measured before and after Ramadan for all 30 subjects. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis, targeting the genome of Bacteroides and Firmicutes was performed to determine its presence in the stool samples. Food intake was assessed by a 3-day food record before and after Ramadan. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS ver.13 and Minitab ver.17. P&lt;0.05 considered the level of significance. The study results showed that serum levels of butyrate significantly increase during the month from 0.23 ± 0.02 mM to 0.46 ±0.03 mM (P&lt;0.05). The gut Bacteroides and Firmicutes increased by 21 and 13 percent after Ramadan compared to before (P&lt;0.05). The increment in Bacteroides occurred in both sexes, but Firmicutes significantly increased only in women. Food intake was decreased during Ramadan. Ramadan fasting caused significant reduction in BMI from 25.72± 0.58 kg/m2 to 25.25± 0.55 kg/m2 (P&lt;0.05). Serum levels of LDL, HDL, LDL/HDL ratio, and total cholesterol significantly decreased during Ramadan (P&lt;0.05). However, the decrease in FBS and TG level were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). It can be stated that the promotion of Bacteroides and Firmicutes in the gut might play a crucial role in health promotion. However, more research is needed to achieve a definite conclusion.

## Effect of Differences in the Microbiome of Cyp17a1-Deficient Mice on Atherosclerotic Background.
 26.06.2021, _A Künstner, R Aherrahrou, M Hirose, P Bruse, SM Ibrahim, H Busch, J Erdmann, Z Aherrahrou_


CYP17A1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that has 17-alpha-hydroxylase and C17,20-lyase activities. Cyp17a11 deficiency is associated with high body mass and visceral fat deposition in atherosclerotic female ApoE knockout (KO, d/d or -/-) mice. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of diet and Cyp17a1 genotype on the gut microbiome. Female Cyp17a1 (d/d) × ApoE (d/d) (DKO) and ApoE (d/d) (controls) were fed either standard chow or a Western-type diet (WTD), and we demonstrated the effects of genetics and diet on the body mass of the mice and composition of their gut microbiome. We found a significantly lower alpha diversity after accounting for the ecological network structure in DKO mice and WTD-fed mice compared with chow-fed ApoE(d/d). Furthermore, we found a strong significant positive association of the Firmicutes vs. Bacteroidota ratio with body mass and the circulating total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations of the mice when feeding the WTD, independent of the Cyp17a1 genotype. Further pathway enrichment and network analyses revealed a substantial effect of Cyp17a1 genotype on associated cardiovascular and obesity-related pathways involving aspartate and L-arginine. Future studies are required to validate these findings and further investigate the role of aspartate/L-arginine pathways in the obesity and body fat distribution in our mouse model.

## Telmisartan induces a specific gut microbiota signature which may mediate its antiobesity effect.
 04.07.2021, _L Beckmann, A Künstner, ML Freschi, G Huber, I Stölting, SM Ibrahim, M Hirose, M Freitag, EA Langan, U Matschl, CE Galuska, B Fuchs, JK Knobloch, H Busch, W Raasch_


Telmisartan prevents diet-induced obesity (DIO) in rodents. Given that the precise underlying mechanism is not known, we examined whether a gut-related mechanism might be involved. Sprague-Dawley rats received cafeteria diet (CD) for 3 months to develop DIO and were administered either telmisartan (8 mg/kgbw) or vehicle. In addition, pair-fed (PF) rats received CD adjusted to TEL and control rats (CON) only received chow. Stool samples were analysed by 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. CD-fed rats became obese while TEL, PF and CON rats remained lean. Alpha diversity analyses indicated that bacterial diversity was similar before the study but changed over time. Beta diversity revealed a time-, CD- and telmisartan-dependent effect. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and the abundance of Blautia, Allobaculum and Parasutterella were higher in DIO and PF than in CON, but not in TEL. Enterotype (ET)-like clustering analyses, Kleinberg's hub network scoring and random forest analyses also indicated that telmisartan induced a specific signature of gut microbiota. In response to stool transfer from telmisartan-pre-treated donor to high-fat fed acceptor mice, body weight gain was slightly attenuated. We attribute the anti-obesity action of telmisartan treatment to diet-independent alterations in gut microbiota as the microbiota from telmisartan-treated, CD-fed rats clearly differed from those of DIO and PF rats. ET-like clustering network, random forest classification and the higher stability in bacterial co-occurrence network analyses indicate that there is more than one indicator species for telmisartan's specific signature, which is further strengthened by the fact that we cannot identify a single indicator species.

## Novel insights into the genetically obese (ob/ob) and diabetic (db/db) mice: two sides of the same coin.
 02.07.2021, _F Suriano, S Vieira-Silva, G Falony, M Roumain, A Paquot, R Pelicaen, M Régnier, NM Delzenne, J Raes, GG Muccioli, M Van Hul, PD Cani_


Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice are commonly used mice models mimicking the conditions of obesity and type 2 diabetes development. However, although ob/ob and db/db mice are similarly gaining weight and developing massive obesity, db/db mice are more diabetic than ob/ob mice. It remains still unclear why targeting the same pathway-leptin signaling-leads to the development of two different phenotypes. Given that gut microbes dialogue with the host via different metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) but also contribute to the regulation of bile acids metabolism, we investigated whether inflammatory markers, bacterial components, bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, and gut microbes could contribute to explain the specific phenotype discriminating the onset of an obese and/or a diabetic state in ob/ob and db/db mice.

## Shades of grey: host phenotype dependent effect of urbanization on the bacterial microbiome of a wild mammal.
 06.07.2021, _MR Stothart, AEM Newman_


Host-associated microbiota are integral to the ecology of their host and may help wildlife species cope with rapid environmental change. Urbanization is a globally replicated form of severe environmental change which we can leverage to better understand wildlife microbiomes. Does the colonization of separate cities result in parallel changes in the intestinal microbiome of wildlife, and if so, does within-city habitat heterogeneity matter? Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we quantified the effect of urbanization (across three cities) on the microbiome of eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). Grey squirrels are ubiquitous in rural and urban environments throughout their native range, across which they display an apparent coat colour polymorphism (agouti, black, intermediate).

## Holocene life and microbiome profiling in ancient tropical Lake Chalco, Mexico.
 06.07.2021, _B Moguel, L Pérez, LD Alcaraz, J Blaz, M Caballero, I Muñoz-Velasco, A Becerra, JP Laclette, B Ortega-Guerrero, CS Romero-Oliva, L Herrera-Estrella, S Lozano-García_


Metagenomic and traditional paleolimnological approaches are suitable to infer past biological and environmental changes, however, they are often applied independently, especially in tropical regions. We combined both approaches to investigate Holocene Prokaryote and Eukaryote diversity and microbial metabolic pathways in ancient Lake Chalco, Mexico. Here, we report on diversity among a large number of lineages (36,722 OTUs) and functional diversity (27,636,243 non-clustered predicted proteins, and 6,144 annotated protein-family genes). The most abundant domain is Bacteria (81%), followed by Archaea (15%) and Eukarya (3%). We also determined the diversity of protein families and their relationship to metabolic pathways. The early Holocene (&gt; 11,000 cal years BP) lake was characterized by cool, freshwater conditions, which later became warmer and hyposaline (11,000-6,000 cal years BP). We found high abundances of cyanobacteria, and fungi groups associated with mature forests in these sediments. Bacteria and Archaea include mainly anaerobes and extremophiles that are involved in the sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon cycles. We found evidence for early human impacts, including landscape modifications and lake eutrophication, which began ~ 6,000 cal years BP. Subsaline, temperate conditions were inferred for the past 5,000 years. Finally, we found nitrogen-fixing bacteria and protein-family genes that are linked to contaminated environments, as well as several fungal pathogens of crops in near-surface sediments.

## ORFograph: search for novel insecticidal protein genes in genomic and metagenomic assembly graphs.
 02.07.2021, _T Dvorkina, A Bankevich, A Sorokin, F Yang, B Adu-Oppong, R Williams, K Turner, PA Pevzner_


Since the prolonged use of insecticidal proteins has led to toxin resistance, it is important to search for novel insecticidal protein genes (IPGs) that are effective in controlling resistant insect populations. IPGs are usually encoded in the genomes of entomopathogenic bacteria, especially in large plasmids in strains of the ubiquitous soil bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Since there are often multiple similar IPGs encoded by such plasmids, their assemblies are typically fragmented and many IPGs are scattered through multiple contigs. As a result, existing gene prediction tools (that analyze individual contigs) typically predict partial rather than complete IPGs, making it difficult to conduct downstream IPG engineering efforts in agricultural genomics.

## Measuring and mitigating PCR bias in microbiota datasets.
 06.07.2021, _JD Silverman, RJ Bloom, S Jiang, HK Durand, E Dallow, S Mukherjee, LA David_


PCR amplification plays an integral role in the measurement of mixed microbial communities via high-throughput DNA sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Yet PCR is also known to introduce multiple forms of bias in 16S rRNA studies. Here we present a paired modeling and experimental approach to characterize and mitigate PCR NPM-bias (PCR bias from non-primer-mismatch sources) in microbiota surveys. We use experimental data from mock bacterial communities to validate our approach and human gut microbiota samples to characterize PCR NPM-bias under real-world conditions. Our results suggest that PCR NPM-bias can skew estimates of microbial relative abundances by a factor of 4 or more, but that this bias can be mitigated using log-ratio linear models.
