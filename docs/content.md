## Anti-spike IgG causes severe acute lung injury by skewing macrophage responses during acute SARS-CoV infection.

Newly emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome CoVs (MERS-CoV), and H7N9, cause fatal acute lung injury (ALI) by driving hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation through mechanisms that remain elusive. In SARS-CoV/macaque models, we determined that anti-spike IgG (S-IgG), in productively infected lungs, causes severe ALI by skewing inflammation-resolving response. Alveolar macrophages underwent functional polarization in acutely infected macaques, demonstrating simultaneously both proinflammatory and wound-healing characteristics. The presence of S-IgG prior to viral clearance, however, abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted MCP1 and IL-8 production and proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment and accumulation. Critically, patients who eventually died of SARS (hereafter referred to as deceased patients) displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary proinflammatory, absence of wound-healing macrophages, and faster neutralizing antibody responses. Their sera enhanced SARS-CoV-induced MCP1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of FcγR reduced such effects. Our findings reveal a mechanism responsible for virus-mediated ALI, define a pathological consequence of viral specific antibody response, and provide a potential target for treatment of SARS-CoV or other virus-mediated lung injury.

## Protocol for a Longitudinal Analysis of the Vaginal Microbiome from a Pregnant Cohort of African Women in Nigeria.
 28.03.2020, _NM Odogwu, CAC Onebunne, OO Olayemi, AO Omigbodun_


The vaginal microbiota is an important component of the reproductive health of women as it offers protection against urogenital infection. African women are reported to have a vaginal microbiota colonized with high proportions of strict anaerobes rather than lactobacillus- dominated microbes. These strict anaerobes have been associated with pre-term birth and neonatal disease. The prevalence of pre-term birth (PTB) in Africa poses a major challenge to reproductive healthcare, hence the clinical and scientific attention focused on understanding the causative mechanisms of PTB. A pragmatic approach to curbing PTB requires the identification of the vaginal microbiome during various stages of a healthy pregnancy (the 'normal'). This information will provide baseline data for future investigations of vaginal microbiome that may cause PTB (the 'abnormal'). We present a protocol for the longitudinal analysis of vaginal microbiome in a cohort of pregnant women in Southwest Nigeria.

## Ruminococcus gnavus bacteremia, an uncommon presentation of a common member of the human gut microbiota: case report and literature review.

Case report: We present a case of a 66-year-old female diagnosed with R. gnavus bacteremia associated with fecal peritonits secondary to small-bowel herniation and perforation. Identification as R. gnavus was delayed because of absence of this species in the MALDI-TOF MS database (Vitek MS, bioMérieux). Identification was provided by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Review: R. gnavus, a Gram-positive, strictly anaerobic bacterium, is a member of the human gut microbiota. Dysbiosis in the gut microbiota, with increased amounts of R. gnavus, has been described in inflammatory bowel disease. R. gnavus has only been reported occasionally as the cause of infections. Hence the potential pathogenicity is not yet fully recognized, and data regarding the antimicrobial susceptibility profile are rare. Identification of anaerobic bacteria such as R. gnavus is greatly accelerated as a result of the introduction of MALDI-TOF MS. However, as illustrated in this case report, an extensive and up-to-date MALDI-TOF MS database is necessary for providing an accurate identification.
