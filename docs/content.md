Currently, the mechanisms underlying sensory perception and sensory performance in children with food allergies are far from being understood. As well, only recently, single research afforded the oral host-commensal milieu, addressing oral microbial communities in children with peanut allergies. To bridge the current gaps in knowledge both in the sensory and microbial fields, a psychophysiological case-control study was performed in allergic children (n = 29) and a healthy sex-age-matched control group (n = 30). Taste perception, food neophobia, and liking were compared in allergic and non-allergic children. The same subjects were characterized for their oral microbiota composition by addressing saliva to assess whether specific profiles were associated with the loss of oral tolerance in children with food allergies. Our study evidenced an impaired ability to correctly identify taste qualities in the allergic group compared to controls. These results were also consistent with anatomical data related to the fungiform papillae on the tongue, which are lower in number in the allergic group. Furthermore, distinct oral microbial profiles were associated with allergic disease, with significant down-representations of the phylum Firmicutes and of the genera Veillonella spp., Streptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., and Neisseria spp. For the first time, this study emphasizes the link between sensory perception and food allergy, which is a novel and whole-organism view of this pathology. Our data indicated that an impaired taste perception, as regards both functionality and physiologically, was associated with food allergy, which marginally influences the food neophobia attitude. It is also accompanied by compositional shifts in oral microbiota, which is, in turn, another actor of this complex interplay and is deeply interconnected with mucosal immunity. This multidisciplinary research will likely open exciting new approaches to therapeutic interventions.

Antibiotic exposure at the beginning of life can lead to increased antimicrobial resistance and perturbations of the developing microbiome. Early-life microbiome disruption increases the risks of developing chronic diseases later in life. Fear of missing evolving neonatal sepsis is the key driver for antibiotic overtreatment early in life. Bias (a systemic deviation towards overtreatment) and noise (a random scatter) affect the decision-making process. In this perspective, we advocate for a factual approach quantifying the burden of treatment in relation to the burden of disease balancing antimicrobial stewardship and effective sepsis management.

## The orchestra of human bacteriome by hormones.
 03.05.2023, _A Luqman_


Human microbiome interact reciprocally with the host. Recent findings showed the capability of microorganisms to response towards host signaling molecules, such as hormones. Studies confirmed the complex response of bacteria in response to hormones exposure. These hormones impact many aspects on bacteria, such as the growth, metabolism, and virulence. The effects of each hormone seem to be species-specific. The most studied hormones are cathecolamines also known as stress hormones that consists of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine. These hormones affect the growth of bacteria either inhibit or enhance by acting like a siderophore. Epinephrine and norepinephrine have also been reported to activate QseBC, a quorum sensing in Gram-negative bacteria and eventually enhances the virulence of pathogens. Other hormones were also reported to play a role in shaping human microbiome composition and affect their behavior. Considering the complex response of bacteria on hormones, it highlights the necessity to take the impact of hormones on bacteria into account in studying human health in relation to human microbiome.

## Targeting the human gut microbiome with small-molecule inhibitors.
 28.04.2023, _AYM Woo, MA Aguilar Ramos, R Narayan, KC Richards-Corke, ML Wang, WJ Sandoval-Espinola, EP Balskus_


The human gut microbiome is a complex microbial community that is strongly linked to both host health and disease. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of these microorganisms on host biology remain largely uncharacterized. The development of non-lethal, small-molecule inhibitors that target specific gut microbial activities enables a powerful but underutilized approach to studying the gut microbiome and a promising therapeutic strategy. In this Review, we will discuss the challenges of studying this microbial community, the historic use of small-molecule inhibitors in microbial ecology, and recent applications of this strategy. We also discuss the evidence suggesting that host-targeted drugs can affect the growth and metabolism of gut microbes. Finally, we address the issues of developing and implementing microbiome-targeted small-molecule inhibitors and define important future directions for this research.

_Humans, Proteomics, Health Promotion, Environmental Health, Microbiota, Biomarkers_
Human health is determined by the interaction of our environment with the genome, epigenome, and microbiome, which shape the transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic landscape of cells and tissues. Precision environmental health is an emerging field leveraging environmental and system-level ('omic) data to understand underlying environmental causes of disease, identify biomarkers of exposure and response, and develop new prevention and intervention strategies. In this article we provide real-life illustrations of the utility of precision environmental health approaches, identify current challenges in the field, and outline new opportunities to promote health through a precision environmental health framework.

## Emerging role of bacterial outer membrane vesicle in gastrointestinal tract.
 30.04.2023, _CM Tian, MF Yang, HM Xu, MZ Zhu, Y Zhang, J Yao, LS Wang, YJ Liang, DF Li_


Bacteria form a highly complex ecosystem in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In recent years, mounting evidence has shown that bacteria can release nanoscale phospholipid bilayer particles that encapsulate nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and other molecules. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by microorganisms and can transport a variety of important factors, such as virulence factors, antibiotics, HGT, and defensive factors produced by host eukaryotic cells. In addition, these EVs are vital in facilitating communication between microbiota and the host. Therefore, bacterial EVs play a crucial role in maintaining the GI tract's health and proper functioning. In this review, we outlined the structure and composition of bacterial EVs. Additionally, we highlighted the critical role that bacterial EVs play in immune regulation and in maintaining the balance of the gut microbiota. To further elucidate progress in the field of intestinal research and to provide a reference for future EV studies, we also discussed the clinical and pharmacological potential of bacterial EVs, as well as the necessary efforts required to understand the mechanisms of interaction between bacterial EVs and gut pathogenesis.

As a chronic encephalopathy, drug addiction is responsible for millions of deaths per year around the world. The gut microbiome is a crucial component of the human microbiome. Through dynamic bidirectional communication along the 'gut-brain axis,' gut bacteria cooperate with their hosts to regulate the development and function of the immune, metabolic, and nervous systems.

The continuous proliferation of intestinal stem cells followed by their tightly regulated differentiation to epithelial cells is essential for the maintenance of the gut epithelial barrier and its functions. How these processes are tuned by diet and gut microbiome is an important, but poorly understood question. Dietary soluble fibers, such as inulin, are known for their ability to impact the gut bacterial community and gut epithelium, and their consumption has been usually associated with health improvement in mice and humans. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that inulin consumption modifies the composition of colonic bacteria and this impacts intestinal stem cells functions, thus affecting the epithelial structure.

## Phenolamide extract of apricot bee pollen alleviates glucolipid metabolic disorders and modulates the gut microbiota and metabolites in high-fat diet-induced obese mice.
 27.04.2023, _X Zhang, X Wu, G Xiao, G Liu, H Dong, R Liu, Q Lu_


Obesity is a serious health problem, and it is important to discover natural active ingredients for alleviating it. In this study, we investigated the effect of phenolamide extract (PAE) from apricot bee pollen on obese mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The main compounds in PAE were identified by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS, and HFD-fed mice were treated with PAE for 12 weeks. The results demonstrated that the content of phenolamides in PAE was 87.75 ± 5.37%, with tri-p-coumaroyl spermidine as the dominant compound. PAE intervention in HFD-fed mice effectively reduced weight gain and lipid accumulation in the liver and epididymal fat, increased glucose tolerance, reduced insulin resistance and improved lipid metabolism. In terms of the gut microbiota, PAE could reverse the increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in HFD-fed mice. In addition, PAE could increase beneficial bacteria such as Muribaculaceae and Parabacteroides, and reduce harmful bacteria such as Peptostreptococcaceae and Romboutsia. Metabolomic analysis revealed that PAE could regulate the levels of metabolites, including bile acids, phosphatidyl choline (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE) and tyrosine. This is the first study finding that PAE can regulate glucolipid metabolism and modulate the gut microbiota and metabolites in HFD-induced obese mice, and the results indicate that PAE can be used as a functional dietary supplement to alleviate HFD-induced obesity.

## Illuminating the Oral Microbiome and its Host Interactions: Animal models of disease.
 28.04.2023, _G Hajishengallis_


Periodontitis and caries are driven by complex interactions between the oral microbiome and host factors, i.e., inflammation and dietary sugars, respectively. Animal models have been instrumental in our mechanistic understanding of these oral diseases, although no single model can faithfully reproduce all aspects of a given human disease. This review discusses evidence that the utility of an animal model lies in its capacity to address a specific hypothesis and, therefore, different aspects of a disease can be investigated using distinct and complementary models. As in vitro systems cannot replicate the complexity of in vivo host-microbe interactions and human research is typically correlative, model organisms - their limitations notwithstanding - remain essential in proving causality, identifying therapeutic targets and evaluating the safety and efficacy of novel treatments. To achieve broader and deeper insights into oral disease pathogenesis, animal model-derived findings can be synthesized with data from in vitro and clinical research. In the absence of better mechanistic alternatives, dismissal of animal models on fidelity issues would impede further progress to understand and treat oral disease.

## How does plant sex alter microbiota assembly in dioecious plants?
 29.04.2023, _Q Guo, Y Zhu, H Korpelainen, Ü Niinemets, C Li_


Plant microbiota can greatly impact plant growth, defense, and health in different environments. Thus, it might be evolutionarily beneficial for plants to be able to control processes related to microbiota assembly. Dioecious plant species display sexual dimorphism in morphology, physiology, and immunity. These differences imply that male and female individuals might differently regulate their microbiota, but the role of sex in microbiota assembly has been largely neglected so far. Here, we introduce the mechanism of how sex controls microbiota in plants analogically to the sex regulation of gut microbiota in animals, in particular in humans. We argue that plant sex imposes selective pressure on filtering and constructing microbiota in the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere along the soil-plant continuum. Since male plants are more resistant than female plants to environmental stresses, we suggest that a male host forms more stable and resistant plant microbiota that cooperate more effectively with the host to resist stresses. Male and female plants can distinguish whether a plant is of the same or different sex, and males can alleviate stress-caused damage in females. The impact of a male host on microbiota would protect female plants from unfavorable environments.

## Compositional Changes in Sediment Microbiota Are Associated with Seasonal Variation of the Water Column in High-Altitude Hyperarid Andean Lake Systems.
 27.04.2023, _I Ramos-Tapia, P Salinas, R Núñez, D Cortez, J Soto, M Paneque_


The lacustrine systems of La Brava and La Punta, located in the Tilopozo sector in the extreme south of Salar de Atacama, are pristine high-altitude Andean lakes found along the central Andes of South America. This shallow ecosystem suffers from permanent evaporation, leading to falling water levels, causing it to recede or disappear during the dry season. This dynamic causes physicochemical changes in lakes, such as low nutrient availability, pH change, and dissolved metals, which can influence the composition of the microbial community. In this study, we used a metataxonomic approach (16S rRNA hypervariable regions V3 to V4) to characterize the sedimentary microbiota of these lakes. To understand how the water column affects and is structured in the microbiota of these lakes, we combined the analysis of the persistence of the water column through satellite images and physicochemical characterization. Our results show a significant difference in abiotic factors and microbiota composition between La Punta and La Brava lakes. In addition, microbiota analysis revealed compositional changes in the ecological disaggregation (main and isolated bodies) and antagonistic changes in the abundance of certain taxa between lakes. These findings are an invaluable resource for understanding the microbiological diversity of high Andean lakes using a multidisciplinary approach that evaluates the microbiota behavior in response to abiotic factors. IMPORTANCE In this study, we analyzed the persistence of the water column through satellite images and physicochemical characterization to investigate the composition and diversity in High Andean Lake Systems in a hyperarid environment. In addition to the persistence of the water column, this approach can be used to analyze changes in the morphology of saline accumulations and persistence of snow or ice; for example, for establishing variable plant cover over time and evaluating the microbiota associated with soils with seasonal changes in plants. This makes it an ideal approach to search for novel extremophilic microorganisms with unique properties. In our case, it was used to study microorganisms capable of resisting desiccation and water restriction for a considerable period and adapting to survive in ecological niches, such as those with high UV irradiation, extreme drought, and high salt concentration.

## Dynamics of microbial community composition during degradation of silks in burial environment.
 01.05.2023, _B Wang, C Zhu, Y Hu, B Zhang, J Wang_


The silk residues in the soil formed the unique niche, termed "silksphere." Here, we proposed a hypothesis that silksphere microbiota have great potential as a biomarker for unraveling the degradation of the ancient silk textiles with great archaeological and conservation values. To test our hypothesis, in this study, we monitored the dynamics of microbial community composition during silk degradation via both indoor soil microcosmos model and outdoor environment with amplicon sequencing against 16S and ITS gene. Microbial community divergence was evaluated with Welch two sample t-test, PCoA, negative binomial generalized log-linear model and clustering, etc. Community assembly mechanisms differences between silksphere and bulk soil microbiota were compared with dissimilarity-overlap curve (DOC) model, Neutral model and Null model. A well-established machine learning algorithm, random forest, was also applied to the screening of potential biomarkers of silk degradation. The results illustrated the ecological and microbial variability during the microbial degradation of silk. Vast majority of microbes populating the silksphere microbiota strongly diverged from those in bulk soil. Certain microbial flora can serve as an indicator of silk degradation, which would lead to a novel perspective to perform identification of archaeological silk residues in the field. To sum up, this study provides a new perspective to perform the identification of archaeological silk residue through the dynamics of microbial communities.

## DeepMicroGen: a generative adversarial network based method for longitudinal microbiome data imputation.
 26.04.2023, _JM Choi, M Ji, LT Watson, L Zhang_


The human microbiome which is linked to various diseases by growing evidence, has a profound impact on human health. Since changes in the composition of the microbiome across time are associated with disease and clinical outcomes, microbiome analysis should be performed in a longitudinal study. However, due to limited sample sizes and differing numbers of timepoints for different subjects, a significant amount of data cannot be utilized, directly affecting the quality of analysis results. Deep generative models have been proposed to address this lack of data issue. Specifically, a generative adversarial network (GAN) has been successfully utilized for data augmentation to improve prediction tasks. Recent studies have also shown improved performance of GAN-based models for missing value imputation in a multivariate time series dataset compared to traditional imputation methods.
