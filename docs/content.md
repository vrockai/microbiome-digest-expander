The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has garnered unprecedented global attention. It caused over 2.47 million deaths through various syndromes such as acute respiratory distress, hypercoagulability, and multiple organ failure. The viral invasion proceeds through the ACE2 receptor, expressed in multiple cell types, and in some patients caused serious damage to tissues, organs, immune cells, and the microbes that colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Some patients who survived the SARS-CoV-2 infection have developed months of persistent long-COVID-19 symptoms or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Diagnosis of these patients has revealed multiple biological effects, none of which are mutually exclusive. However, the severity of COVID-19 also depends on numerous comorbidities such as obesity, age, diabetes, and hypertension and care must be taken with respect to other multiple morbidities, such as host immunity. Gut microbiota in relation to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology is considered to evolve COVID-19 progression via mechanisms of biochemical metabolism, exacerbation of inflammation, intestinal mucosal secretion, cytokine storm, and immunity regulation. Therefore, modulation of gut microbiome equilibrium through food supplements and probiotics remains a hot topic of current research and debate. In this review, we discuss the biological complications of the physio-pathological effects of COVID-19 infection, GIT immune response, and therapeutic pharmacological strategies. We also summarize the therapeutic targets of probiotics, their limitations, and the efficacy of preclinical and clinical drugs to effectively inhibit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

## Novel probiotic preparation with in vivo gluten-degrading activity and potential modulatory effects on the gut microbiota.

Gluten possesses unique properties that render it only partially digestible. Consequently, it exerts detrimental effects on a part of the worldwide population who are afflicted with celiac disease (1%) or related disorders (5%), particularly due to the potential for cross-contamination even when adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD). Finding solutions to break down gluten during digestion has a high nutritional and social impact. Here, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled in vivo challenge investigated the gluten-degrading activity of a novel probiotic preparation comprising lactobacilli and their cytoplasmic extracts, Bacillus sp., and bacterial protease. In our clinical trial, we collected feces from 70 healthy volunteers at specific time intervals. Probiotic/placebo administration lasted 32 days, followed by 10 days of wash-out. After preliminary GFD to eliminate residual gluten from feces, increasing amounts of gluten (50 mg-10 g) were administered, each one for 4 consecutive days. Compared to placebo, the feces of volunteers fed with probiotics showed much lower amounts of residual gluten, mainly with increased intakes. Probiotics also regulate the intestinal microbial communities, improving the abundance of genera pivotal to maintaining homeostasis. Quantitative PCR confirmed that all probiotics persisted during the intervention, some also during wash-out. Probiotics promoted a fecal metabolome with potential immunomodulating activity, mainly related to derivatives of branched-chain amino acids and short-chain fatty acids.

Dietary fiber supplements are a strategy to close the 'fiber gap' and induce targeted modulations of the gut microbiota. However, higher doses of fiber supplements cause gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms that differ among individuals. What determines these inter-individual differences is insufficiently understood. Here we analyzed findings from a six-week randomized controlled trial that evaluated GI symptoms to corn bran arabinoxylan (AX; n = 15) relative to non-fermentable microcrystalline cellulose (MCC; n = 16) at efficacious supplement doses of 25 g/day (females) or 35 g/day (males) in adults with excess weight. Self-reported flatulence, bloating, and stomach aches were evaluated weekly. Bacterial taxa involved in AX fermentation were identified by bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging. Associations between GI symptoms, fecal microbiota features, and diet history were systematically investigated. AX supplementation increased symptoms during the first three weeks relative to MCC (p &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney tests), but subjects 'adapted' with symptoms reverting to baseline levels toward the end of treatment. Symptom adaptations were individualized and correlated with the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium longum at baseline (rs = 0.74, p = 0.002), within the bacterial community that utilized AX (rs = 0.69, p = 0.006), and AX-induced shifts in acetate (rs = 0.54, p = 0.039). Lower baseline consumption of animal-based foods and higher whole grains associated with less severity and better adaptation. These findings suggest that humans do 'adapt' to tolerate efficacious fiber doses, and this process is linked to their microbiome and dietary factors known to interact with gut microbes, providing a basis for the development of strategies for improved tolerance of dietary fibers.

To establish and evaluate an intestinal microbiota dysbiosis-induced obesity mouse model. 50 C57BL/6 J male healthy mice were randomly divided into an obesity model group and the control group. The body weight, body length, and Lee's index of the two groups of mice at week 1 and week 10 were compared. Serum glucose (GLU), total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) were measured by enzyme-labeled colorimetric methods. Illumina HiSeq 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing technology was used to characterize intestinal microbiota in feces. The success rate of model establishment in obese mice was 52%. The body weight, body length, Lee's index, and abdominal fat (wet weight) in the obese model group were all higher than those in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01). Serum GLU and TC levels in the obesity model group were higher than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05), and there was no difference in TG levels between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). The control group contained more abundant intestinal microbiota phyla and genera than did the obesity model group; the differences between the two groups were significant (FDR ≤ 0.05, P ≤ 0.05). Intestinal microbiota dysbiosis can be used to generate an obesity model in mice.

## Effect of microplastics pollution on the gut microbiome of anecic and endogeic earthworms.
 07.06.2024, _C Papazlatani, P Garbeva, E Huerta-Lwanga_


Microplastic (MP) pollution constitutes an emerging type of pollution threatening both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The impact on aquatic ecosystems has been extensively studied, but the effect on terrestrial ecosystems and their inhabitants is mostly underexplored. In this study we explored the effect of microplastic pollution on gut bacterial microbiome of endogeic (Aporrectodea caliginosa) and anecic (Lumbricus terrestris) earthworms. The experiments were performed in sandy soil with 0.2% of low-density polyethylene microplastics (LDPE MPs). We observed that the endogeic earthworms had 100% survival while anecic earthworms survived 25 days in the control (i.e. absence of MPs) and 21 days in the treatment with LDPE MPs. The main driver of shifts in the diversity and composition of the bacterial communities in the gut of tested earthworms was the life style of the worms, followed by the presence of MPs. The bacterial microbiome diversity was significantly different among the 2 types of earthworms and the highest bacterial diversity was found in the gut of the endogeic earthworms. The effect of microplastics on gut bacterial microbiome was clearly observed in the changes in the relative abundance of several phyla and families of the bacterial communities in both types of earthworms, although it was most evident in the anecic earthworms. The Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the main groups enhanced in the microplastic treatments, suggesting enrichment of the bacterial communities with potential plastic degraders.

## Evolutionary history of tyrosine-supplementing endosymbionts in pollen-feeding beetles.
 11.06.2024, _JC Wierz, ML Gimmel, S Huthmacher, T Engl, M Kaltenpoth_


Many insects feeding on nutritionally challenging diets like plant sap, leaves, or wood engage in ancient associations with bacterial symbionts that supplement limiting nutrients or produce digestive or detoxifying enzymes. However, the distribution, function, and evolutionary dynamics of microbial symbionts in insects exploiting other plant tissues or relying on a predacious diet remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the evolutionary history and function of the intracellular gamma-proteobacterial symbiont "Candidatus Dasytiphilus stammeri" in soft-winged flower beetles (Melyridae, Dasytinae) that transition from saprophagy or carnivory to palinivory (pollen-feeding) between larval and adult stage. Reconstructing the distribution of the symbiont within the Dasytinae phylogeny unraveled a long-term coevolution, originating from a single acquisition event with subsequent host-symbiont codiversification, but also several independent symbiont losses. The analysis of 20 different symbiont genomes revealed that their genomes are severely eroded. However, the universally retained shikimate pathway indicates that the core metabolic contribution to their hosts is the provisioning of tyrosine for cuticle sclerotization and melanization. Despite the high degree of similarity in gene content and order across symbiont strains, the capacity to synthesize additional essential amino acids and vitamins and to recycle urea is retained in some but not all symbionts, suggesting ecological differences among host lineages. This report of tyrosine-provisioning symbionts in insects with saprophagous or carnivorous larvae and pollen-feeding adults expands our understanding of tyrosine supplementation as an important symbiont-provided benefit across a broad range of insects with diverse feeding ecologies.

## Fungal biomass and ectomycorrhizal community assessment of phosphorus responsive Pinus taeda plantations.
 13.06.2024, _J Hackman, A Woodley, D Carter, B Strahm, C Averill, R Vilgalys, K Garcia, R Cook_


Ectomycorrhizal fungi and non-ectomycorrhizal fungi are responsive to changes in environmental and nutrient availabilities. Although many species of ectomycorrhizas are known to enhance the uptake of phosphorus and other nutrients for Pinus taeda, it is not understood how to optimize these communities to have tangible effects on plantation silviculture and P use efficiency. The first step of this process is the identification of native fungi present in the system that are associated with P. taeda and influence P uptake efficiency. We used sand-filled mesh bags baited with finely ground apatite to sample ectomycorrhizal and non-ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the rhizosphere of P-responsive P. taeda under several field conditions. Mesh bags were assessed for biomass accumulation over three years using a single three-month burial period pre-harvest and three six-month burial periods post-planting. Amplicon sequencing assessed ectomycorrhizal and non-ectomycorrhizal communities between phosphorus treatments, sites, mesh bags, and the rhizosphere of actively growing P. taeda in the field. We found biomass accumulation within the mesh bags was inversely related to increasing phosphorus fertilization (carryover) rates from pre-harvest to post-planting. Up to 25% increases in total biomass within the bags were observed for bags baited with P. Taxonomic richness was highest in Alfisol soils treated with phosphorus from the previous rotation and lowest in the Spodosol regardless of phosphorus treatment.

Uncaria rhynchophylla is an important traditional herbal medicine in China, and the yield and quality of Uncaria rhynchophylla can be improved by suitable soil conditioners because of changing the soil properties. In this paper, Uncaria rhynchophylla associated alkaloids and soil microbial communities were investigated. The field experiment was set up with the following control group: (M1, no soil conditioner) and different soil conditioner treatment groups (M2, biomass ash; M3, water retention agent; M4, biochar; M5, lime powder and M6, malic acid). The results showed that M2 significantly increased the fresh and dry weight and the contents of isorhynchophylline, corynoxeine, isocorynoxeine, and total alkaloids. Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi were major bacterial phyla. Correlation analysis showed that fresh and dry weight was significantly positively correlated with Acidobacteria, while alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, phosphatase activity, fresh and dry weight, corynoxeine, and isocorynoxeine were significantly negatively correlated with Chloroflexi. The application of soil conditioner M2 increased the abundance of Acidobacteria and decreased the abundance of Chloroflexi, which contributed to improving the soil nutrient content, yield, and quality of Uncaria rhynchophylla. In summary, biomass ash may be a better choice of soil conditioner in Uncaria rhynchophylla growing areas.

Understanding the extent of heritability of a plant-associated microbiome (phytobiome) is critically important for exploitation of phytobiomes in agriculture. Two crosses were made between pairs of cotton cultivars (Z2 and J11, L1 and Z49) with differential resistance to Verticillium wilt. F2 plants were grown in a field, together with the four parents to study the heritability of cotton rhizosphere microbiome. Amplicon sequencing was used to profile bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere. F2 offspring plants of both crosses had higher average alpha diversity indices than the two parents; parents differed significantly from F2 offspring in Bray-Curtis beta diversity indices as well. Two types of data were used to study the heritability of rhizosphere microbiome: principal components (PCs) and individual top microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). For the L1 × Z49 cross, the variance among the F2 progeny genotypes (namely, genetic variance, VT) was significantly greater than the random variability (VE) for 12 and 34 out of top 100 fungal and bacterial PCs, respectively. For the Z2 × J11 cross, the corresponding values were 10 and 20 PCs. For 29 fungal OTUs and 10 bacterial OTUs out of the most abundant 100 OTUs, genetic variance (VT) was significantly greater than VE for the L1 × Z49 cross; the corresponding values for the Z2 × J11 cross were 24 and one. The estimated heritability was mostly in the range of 40% to 60%. These results suggested the existence of genetic control of polygenic nature for specific components of rhizosphere microbiome in cotton. KEY POINTS: • F2 offspring cotton plants differed significantly from parents in rhizosphere microbial diversity. • Specific rhizosphere components are likely to be genetically controlled by plants. • Common PCs and specific microbial groups are significant genetic components between the two crosses.

## Genomic insights into redox-driven microbial processes for carbon decomposition in thawing Arctic soils and permafrost.
 11.06.2024, _Y Li, Y Xue, T Roy Chowdhury, DE Graham, SG Tringe, JK Jansson, N Taş_


Climate change is rapidly transforming Arctic landscapes where increasing soil temperatures speed up permafrost thaw. This exposes large carbon stocks to microbial decomposition, possibly worsening climate change by releasing more greenhouse gases. Understanding how microbes break down soil carbon, especially under the anaerobic conditions of thawing permafrost, is important to determine future changes. Here, we studied the microbial community dynamics and soil carbon decomposition potential in permafrost and active layer soils under anaerobic laboratory conditions that simulated an Arctic summer thaw. The microbial and viral compositions in the samples were analyzed based on metagenomes, metagenome-assembled genomes, and metagenomic viral contigs (mVCs). Following the thawing of permafrost, there was a notable shift in microbial community structure, with fermentative Firmicutes and Bacteroidota taking over from Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria over the 60-day incubation period. The increase in iron and sulfate-reducing microbes had a significant role in limiting methane production from thawed permafrost, underscoring the competition within microbial communities. We explored the growth strategies of microbial communities and found that slow growth was the major strategy in both the active layer and permafrost. Our findings challenge the assumption that fast-growing microbes mainly respond to environmental changes like permafrost thaw. Instead, they indicate a common strategy of slow growth among microbial communities, likely due to the thermodynamic constraints of soil substrates and electron acceptors, and the need for microbes to adjust to post-thaw conditions. The mVCs harbored a wide range of auxiliary metabolic genes that may support cell protection from ice formation in virus-infected cells.

## Sewage Sludge Promotes the Accumulation of Antibiotic Resistance Genes in Tomato Xylem.
 10.06.2024, _WJ Li, HZ Li, J Xu, MR Gillings, YG Zhu_


Xylem serves as a conduit linking soil to the aboveground plant parts and facilitating the upward movement of microbes into leaves and fruits. Despite this potential, the composition of the xylem microbiome and its associated risks, including antibiotic resistance, are understudied. Here, we cultivated tomatoes and analyzed their xylem sap to assess the microbiome and antibiotic resistance profiles following treatment with sewage sludge. Our findings show that xylem microbes primarily originate from soil, albeit with reduced diversity in comparison to those of their soil microbiomes. Using single-cell Raman spectroscopy coupled with D2O labeling, we detected significantly higher metabolic activity in xylem microbes than in rhizosphere soil, with 87% of xylem microbes active compared to just 36% in the soil. Additionally, xylem was pinpointed as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), with their abundance being 2.4-6.9 times higher than in rhizosphere soil. Sludge addition dramatically increased the abundance of ARGs in xylem and also increased their mobility and host pathogenicity. Xylem represents a distinct ecological niche for microbes and is a significant reservoir for ARGs. These results could be used to manage the resistome in crops and improve food safety.

Boreal freshwaters go through four seasons, however, studies about the decomposition of terrestrial and plastic compounds often focus only on summer. We compared microbial decomposition of 13C-polyethylene, 13C-polystyrene, and 13C-plant litter (Typha latifolia) by determining the biochemical fate of the substrate carbon and identified the microbial decomposer taxa in humic lake waters in four seasons. For the first time, the annual decomposition rate including separated seasonal variation was calculated for microplastics and plant litter in the freshwater system. Polyethylene decomposition was not detected, whereas polystyrene and plant litter were degraded in all seasons. In winter, decomposition rates of polystyrene and plant litter were fivefold and fourfold slower than in summer, respectively. Carbon from each substrate was mainly respired in all seasons. Plant litter was utilized efficiently by various microbial groups, whereas polystyrene decomposition was limited to Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. The decomposition was not restricted only to the growth season, highlighting that the decomposition of both labile organic matter and extremely recalcitrant microplastics continues throughout the seasons.

## Coral microbiomes are structured by environmental gradients in deep waters.
 13.06.2024, _SA Vohsen, S Herrera_


Coral-associated microbiomes vary greatly between colonies and localities with functional consequences on the host. However, the full extent of variability across the ranges of most coral species remains unknown, especially for corals living in deep waters which span greater ranges. Here, we characterized the microbiomes of four octocoral species from mesophotic and bathyal deep-sea habitats in the northern Gulf of Mexico, Muricea pendula, Swiftia exserta, Callogorgia delta, and Paramuricea biscaya, using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. We sampled extensively across their ranges to test for microbiome differentiation between and within species, examining the influence of environmental factors that vary with depth (53-2224 m) and geographic location (over 680 m) as well as the host coral's genotype using RAD-sequencing.
