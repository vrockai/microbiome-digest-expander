_Microbiota, Metagenome, Biological Evolution_
Bacterial secondary metabolites, synthesized by enzymes encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), can underlie microbiome homeostasis and serve as commercialized products, which have historically been mined from a select group of taxa. While evolutionary approaches have proven beneficial for prioritizing BGCs for experimental characterization efforts to uncover new natural products, dedicated bioinformatics tools designed for comparative and evolutionary analysis of BGCs within focal taxa are limited. We thus developed lineage specific analysis of BGCs (lsaBGC; https://github.com/Kalan-Lab/lsaBGC) to aid exploration of microdiversity and evolutionary trends across homologous groupings of BGCs, gene cluster families (GCFs), in any bacterial taxa of interest. lsaBGC enables rapid and direct identification of GCFs in genomes, calculates evolutionary statistics and conservation for BGC genes, and builds a framework to allow for base resolution mining of novel variants through metagenomic exploration. Through application of the suite to four genera commonly found in skin microbiomes, we uncover new insights into the evolution and diversity of their BGCs. We show that the BGC of the virulence-associated carotenoid staphyloxanthin in  Staphylococcus aureus  is ubiquitous across the genus  Staphylococcus . While one GCF encoding the biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin showcases evidence for plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between species, another GCF appears to be transmitted vertically amongst a sub-clade of skin-associated  Staphylococcus . Further, the latter GCF, which is well conserved in  S. aureus , has been lost in most  Staphylococcus epidermidis , which is the most common  Staphylococcus  species on human skin and is also regarded as a commensal. We also identify thousands of novel single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within BGCs from the  Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum  sp. complex, a narrow, multi-species clade that features the most prevalent  Corynebacterium  in healthy skin microbiomes. Although novel SNVs were approximately 10 times as likely to correspond to synonymous changes when located in the top five percentile of conserved sites, lsaBGC identified SNVs that defied this trend and are predicted to underlie amino acid changes within functionally key enzymatic domains. Ultimately, beyond supporting evolutionary investigations of BGCs, lsaBGC also provides important functionalities to aid efforts for the discovery or directed modification of natural products.

## A pan-cancer mycobiome analysis reveals fungal involvement in gastrointestinal and lung tumors.
 30.09.2023, _AB Dohlman, J Klug, M Mesko, IH Gao, SM Lipkin, X Shen, ID Iliev_


_Biomarkers, Candida, DNA, Fungal, Fungi, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Mycobiome_
Fungal microorganisms (mycobiota) comprise a small but immunoreactive component of the human microbiome, yet little is known about their role in human cancers. Pan-cancer analysis of multiple body sites revealed tumor-associated mycobiomes at up to 1 fungal cell per 104 tumor cells. In lung cancer, Blastomyces was associated with tumor tissues. In stomach cancers, high rates of Candida were linked to the expression of pro-inflammatory immune pathways, while in colon cancers Candida was predictive of metastatic disease and attenuated cellular adhesions. Across multiple GI sites, several Candida species were enriched in tumor samples and tumor-associated Candida DNA was predictive of decreased survival. The presence of Candida in human GI tumors was confirmed by external ITS sequencing of tumor samples and by culture-dependent analysis in an independent cohort. These data implicate the mycobiota in the pathogenesis of GI cancers and suggest that tumor-associated fungal DNA may serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers.

## The oral cavity and intestinal microbiome in children with functional constipation.
 09.04.2024, _M Kwiatkowska, M Gołębiewski, M Sikora, EŁ Rycharska, A Krogulska_


Constipation is a widespread problem in paediatric practice, affecting almost 30% of children. One of the key causal factors of constipation may be disturbances in the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal microbiome. The aim of the study was to determine whether the oral and fecal microbiomes differ between children with and without constipation. A total of 91 children over three years of age were included in the study. Of these, 57 were qualified to a group with constipation, and 34 to a group without. The saliva and stool microbiomes were evaluated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Functional constipation was associated with characteristic bacterial taxa in the fecal microbiota. Statistically significant differences were found at the family level: Burkholderiaceae (q = 0.047), Christensenellaceae (q = 0.047), Chlostridiaceae (q = 0.047) were significantly less abundant in the constipation group, while the Tannerellaceae (q = 0.007) were more abundant. At the genus level, the significant differences were observed for rare genera, including Christensenellaceae r-7 (q = 2.88 × 10-2), Fusicatenibacter (q = 2.88 × 10-2), Parabacteroides (q = 1.63 × 10-2), Romboutsia (q = 3.19 × 10-2) and Subdoligranulum (q = 1.17 × 10-2). All of them were less abundant in children with constipation. With the exception of significant taxonomic changes affecting only feces, no differences were found in the alpha and beta diversity of feces and saliva. Children with functional constipation demonstrated significant differences in the abundance of specific bacteria in the stool microbiome compared to healthy children. It is possible that the rare genera identified in our study which were less abundant in the constipated patients (Christensellaceae r-7, Fusicatenibacter, Parabacteroides, Romboutsia and Subdoligranulum) may play a role in protection against constipation. No significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the saliva microbiome.

## Characterization of the gut bacterial and viral microbiota in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.

Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by autoantibodies against insulin producing pancreatic beta cells and initial lack of need for insulin treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate if individuals with LADA have an altered gut microbiota relative to non-diabetic control subjects, individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Bacterial community profiling was performed with primers targeting the variable region 4 of the 16S rRNA gene and sequenced. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were generated with DADA2 and annotated to the SILVA database. The gut virome was sequenced, using a viral particle enrichment and metagenomics approach, assembled, and quantified to describe the composition of the viral community. Comparison of the bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity measures revealed that the gut bacteriome of individuals with LADA resembled that of individuals with T2D. Yet, specific genera were found to differ in abundance in individuals with LADA compared with T1D and T2D, indicating that LADA has unique taxonomical features. The virome composition reflected the stability of the most dominant order Caudovirales and the families Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and Inoviridae, and the dominant family Microviridae. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

## Colonization during a key developmental window reveals microbiota-dependent shifts in growth and immunity during undernutrition.

Childhood undernutrition is a major global health challenge with devastating lifelong consequences. Linear growth stunting due to undernutrition has been linked to poor health outcomes, and mothers who experience growth stunting in childhood are more likely to give birth to stunted children later in life. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that intergenerational colonization of mice with microbiota from human donors with undernutrition may recapitulate certain immune and growth changes observed in this disorder.

## Dermal injury drives a skin to gut axis that disrupts the intestinal microbiome and intestinal immune homeostasis in mice.

The composition of the microbial community in the intestine may influence the functions of distant organs such as the brain, lung, and skin. These microbes can promote disease or have beneficial functions, leading to the hypothesis that microbes in the gut explain the co-occurrence of intestinal and skin diseases. Here, we show that the reverse can occur, and that skin directly alters the gut microbiome. Disruption of the dermis by skin wounding or the digestion of dermal hyaluronan results in increased expression in the colon of the host defense genes Reg3 and Muc2, and skin wounding changes the composition and behavior of intestinal bacteria. Enhanced expression Reg3 and Muc2 is induced in vitro by exposure to hyaluronan released by these skin interventions. The change in the colon microbiome after skin wounding is functionally important as these bacteria penetrate the intestinal epithelium and enhance colitis from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) as seen by the ability to rescue skin associated DSS colitis with oral antibiotics, in germ-free mice, and fecal microbiome transplantation to unwounded mice from mice with skin wounds. These observations provide direct evidence of a skin-gut axis by demonstrating that damage to the skin disrupts homeostasis in intestinal host defense and alters the gut microbiome.
