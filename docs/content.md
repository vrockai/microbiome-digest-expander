Muscle fibre conduction velocity (MFCV) is a basic physiological parameter biophysically related to the diameter of muscle fibres and properties of the sarcolemma. The aim of this study was to assess the intersession reproducibility of the relation between voluntary force and estimates of average muscle fibre conduction velocity (MFCV) from multichannel high-density surface electromyographic recordings (HDsEMG). Ten healthy men performed six linearly increasing isometric ankle dorsiflexions on two separate experimental sessions, 4 weeks apart. Each session involved the recordings of voluntary force during maximal isometric (MViF) and submaximal ramp contractions at 35-50-70% of MViF. Concurrently, the HDsEMG activity was detected from the tibialis anterior muscle and MFCV estimates were derived in 250-ms epochs. Absolute and relative reproducibility of MFCV initial value (intercept) and rate of change (regression slope) as a function of force were assessed by within-subject coefficient of correlation (CVw) and with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). MFCV was positively correlated with voluntary force (R2 = 0.75 ± 0.12) in all individuals and test conditions (P &lt; 0.001). Average CVw for MFCV intercept and slope were of 2.6 ± 2.0% and 11.9 ± 3.2% and ICC values of 0.96 and 0.94, respectively. Overall, MFCV regression coefficients showed a high degree of intersession reproducibility in both absolute and relative terms. These results may have important practical implications in the tracking of training-induced neuromuscular changes and/or in the monitoring of the progress of neuromuscular disorders when a full sEMG signal decomposition is problematic or not possible.

## A candidate gene of Alzheimer diseases was mutated in senescence-accelerated mouse prone (SAMP) 8 mice.
 07.08.2021, _MM Akbor, J Kim, M Nomura, J Sugioka, N Kurosawa, M Isobe_


The senescence-accelerated mouse prone (SAMP) 8 strain exhibits age-related learning and memory deficits (LMD) at 2 months of age. We have found strong association of chromosome 12 locus with learning memory deficit (LMD) phenotype in SAMP8 strain. In the course of searching candidate gene, here we identified solute carrier family 24 sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger member 4 (Slc24a4) in SAMP8 chromosome 12 LMD possessing one single nucleotide polymorphism causing amino acid replacement of Threonine at 413 position with Methionine. Since SLC24A4 has been postulated as a candidate of late onset Alzheimer's diseases (LOAD), we further analyze the functional importance of this polymorphism. By expressing Slc24a4 protein in HEK293 cells, here we showed polymorphic SAMP8 type Slc24a4-T413 M causing significant loss of calcium ion (Ca2+) transporter activity in cells compared with that of wild type mouse (Slc24a4-WT). However, no study yet shows any functional association of human SLC24A4 polymorphism with the onset of LOAD pathogenesis. Thus, our present finding may further help to clarify the importance of this ion exchanger with age related cognitive dysfunction.

## A Scale-Free, Fully Connected Global Transition Network Underlies Known Microbiome Diversity.
 13.07.2021, _G Jing, Y Zhang, L Liu, Z Wang, Z Sun, R Knight, X Su, J Xu_


Microbiomes are inherently linked by their structural similarity, yet the global features of such similarity are not clear. Here, we propose as a solution a search-based microbiome transition network. By traversing a composition-similarity-based network of 177,022 microbiomes, we show that although the compositions are distinct by habitat, each microbiome is on-average only seven neighbors from any other microbiome on Earth, indicating the inherent homology of microbiomes at the global scale. This network is scale-free, suggesting a high degree of stability and robustness in microbiome transition. By tracking the minimum spanning tree in this network, a global roadmap of microbiome dispersal was derived that tracks the potential paths of formulating and propagating microbiome diversity. Such search-based global microbiome networks, reconstructed within hours on just one computing node, provide a readily expanded reference for tracing the origin and evolution of existing or new microbiomes. IMPORTANCE It remains unclear whether and how compositional changes at the "community to community" level among microbiomes are linked to the origin and evolution of global microbiome diversity. Here we propose a microbiome transition model and a network-based analysis framework to describe and simulate the variation and dispersal of the global microbial beta-diversity across multiple habitats. The traversal of a transition network with 177,022 samples shows the inherent homology of microbiome at the global scale. Then a global roadmap of microbiome dispersal derived from the network tracks the potential paths of formulating and propagating microbiome diversity. Such search-based microbiome network provides a readily expanded reference for tracing the origin and evolution of existing or new microbiomes at the global scale.

## Crosstalk between γδ T cells and the microbiota.
 03.08.2021, _PH Papotto, B Yilmaz, B Silva-Santos_


The role of the microbiota in the development and function of γδ T cells-a T cell subset characterized by a T cell receptor composed of one γ-chain and one δ-chain-has been investigated in multiple organs in mice and humans. Interactions between the microbiota and γδ T cells affect both tissue homeostasis and disease pathologies. Notably, microbiota-induced interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing-γδ T cells can mediate a range of immunological processes, from metabolic disorders to neuroinflammation via the gut-brain axis. However, the bidirectional interactions between γδ T cells and the microbiota have not been fully determined. In this Perspective, we dissect the roles of microbiota in modulating γδ T cell development and function, and evaluate the evidence for γδ T cell selection of commensal communities. We also discuss the potential implications of these cells in health and disease and the major open questions and research avenues in the field.

## Host adaptation in gut Firmicutes is associated with sporulation loss and altered transmission cycle.
 08.08.2021, _HP Browne, A Almeida, N Kumar, K Vervier, AT Adoum, E Viciani, NJR Dawson, SC Forster, C Cormie, D Goulding, TD Lawley_


Human-to-human transmission of symbiotic, anaerobic bacteria is a fundamental evolutionary adaptation essential for membership of the human gut microbiota. However, despite its importance, the genomic and biological adaptations underpinning symbiont transmission remain poorly understood. The Firmicutes are a dominant phylum within the intestinal microbiota that are capable of producing resistant endospores that maintain viability within the environment and germinate within the intestine to facilitate transmission. However, the impact of host transmission on the evolutionary and adaptive processes within the intestinal microbiota remains unknown.

## Prolonged drought imparts lasting compositional changes to the rice root microbiome.
 23.07.2021, _C Santos-Medellín, Z Liechty, J Edwards, B Nguyen, B Huang, BC Weimer, V Sundaresan_


Microbial symbioses can mitigate drought stress in crops but harnessing these beneficial interactions will require an in-depth understanding of root microbiome responses to drought cycles. Here, by detailed temporal characterization of root-associated microbiomes of rice plants during drought stress and recovery, we find that endosphere communities remained compositionally altered after rewatering, with prolonged droughts leading to decreased resilience. Several endospheric Actinobacteria were significantly enriched during drought and for weeks after rewatering. Notably, the most abundant endosphere taxon during this period was a Streptomyces, and a corresponding isolate promoted root growth. Additionally, drought stress disrupted the temporal dynamics of late-colonizing microorganisms, permanently altering the normal successional trends of root microbiota. These findings reveal that severe drought results in enduring impacts on rice root microbiomes, including enrichment of taxonomic groups that could shape the recovery response of the host, and have implications relevant to drought protection strategies using root microbiota.

## COPLA, a taxonomic classifier of plasmids.
 06.08.2021, _S Redondo-Salvo, R Bartomeus-Peñalver, L Vielva, KA Tagg, HE Webb, R Fernández-López, F de la Cruz_


_Drug Resistance, Microbial, Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Genomics, Plasmids, Virulence Factors_
Plasmids are mobile genetic elements, key in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, virulence determinants and other adaptive traits in bacteria. Obtaining a robust method for plasmid classification is necessary to better understand the genetics and epidemiology of many pathogens. Until now, plasmid classification systems focused on specific traits, which limited their precision and universality. The definition of plasmid taxonomic units (PTUs), based on average nucleotide identity metrics, allows the generation of a universal plasmid classification scheme, applicable to all bacterial taxa. Here we present COPLA, a software able to assign plasmids to known and novel PTUs, based on their genomic sequence.

## Strainberry: automated strain separation in low-complexity metagenomes using long reads.
 27.07.2021, _R Vicedomini, C Quince, AE Darling, R Chikhi_


High-throughput short-read metagenomics has enabled large-scale species-level analysis and functional characterization of microbial communities. Microbiomes often contain multiple strains of the same species, and different strains have been shown to have important differences in their functional roles. Recent advances on long-read based methods enabled accurate assembly of bacterial genomes from complex microbiomes and an as-yet-unrealized opportunity to resolve strains. Here we present Strainberry, a metagenome assembly pipeline that performs strain separation in single-sample low-complexity metagenomes and that relies uniquely on long-read data. We benchmarked Strainberry on mock communities for which it produces strain-resolved assemblies with near-complete reference coverage and 99.9% base accuracy. We also applied Strainberry on real datasets for which it improved assemblies generating 20-118% additional genomic material than conventional metagenome assemblies on individual strain genomes. We show that Strainberry is also able to refine microbial diversity in a complex microbiome, with complete separation of strain genomes. We anticipate this work to be a starting point for further methodological improvements on strain-resolved metagenome assembly in environments of higher complexities.

## STRONG: metagenomics strain resolution on assembly graphs.
 30.07.2021, _C Quince, S Nurk, S Raguideau, R James, OS Soyer, JK Summers, A Limasset, AM Eren, R Chikhi, AE Darling_


We introduce STrain Resolution ON assembly Graphs (STRONG), which identifies strains de novo, from multiple metagenome samples. STRONG performs coassembly, and binning into metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), and stores the coassembly graph prior to variant simplification. This enables the subgraphs and their unitig per-sample coverages, for individual single-copy core genes (SCGs) in each MAG, to be extracted. A Bayesian algorithm, BayesPaths, determines the number of strains present, their haplotypes or sequences on the SCGs, and abundances. STRONG is validated using synthetic communities and for a real anaerobic digestor time series generates haplotypes that match those observed from long Nanopore reads.
