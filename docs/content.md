## The gut microbiome as a target for adjuvant therapy in obstructive sleep apnea.
 12.11.2020, _M Badran, S Mashaqi, D Gozal_


Introduction: Gut dysbiosis is assumed to play a role in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-associated morbidities. Pre- and probiotics, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and fecal matter transfer (FMT) may offer potential as novel therapeutic strategies that target this gut dysbiosis. As more mechanisms of OSA-induced dysbiosis are being elucidated, these novel approaches are being tested in preclinical and clinical development. Areas covered: We examine the evidence linking OSA to gut dysbiosis and discuss the effects of pre- and probiotics on associated cardiometabolic, neurobehavioral and gastrointestinal disorders. The therapeutic potential of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and fecal matter transplantation (FMT) are also discussed. We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central between 2000 -2020. Expert opinion: To date, there are no clinical trials and only limited evidence from animal studies describing the beneficial effects of pre- and probiotic supplementation on OSA-mediated dysbiosis. Thus, more work is necessary to assess whether prebiotics, probiotics and SCFA are promising future novel strategies for targeting OSA-mediated dysbiosis.

## The microbiome, genetics, and gastrointestinal neoplasms: the evolving field of molecular pathological epidemiology to analyze the tumor-immune-microbiome interaction.
 12.11.2020, _K Mima, K Kosumi, Y Baba, T Hamada, H Baba, S Ogino_


Metagenomic studies using next-generation sequencing technologies have revealed rich human intestinal microbiome, which likely influence host immunity and health conditions including cancer. Evidence indicates a biological link between altered microbiome and cancers in the digestive system. Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis have been found to be enriched in colorectal mucosal tissues from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis that is caused by germline APC mutations. In addition, recent studies have found enrichment of certain oral bacteria, viruses, and fungi in tumor tissue and fecal specimens from patients with gastrointestinal cancer. An integrative approach is required to elucidate the role of microorganisms in the pathogenic process of gastrointestinal cancers, which develop through the accumulation of somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations in neoplastic cells, influenced by host genetic variations, immunity, microbiome, and environmental exposures. The transdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) offers research frameworks to link germline genetics and environmental factors (including diet, lifestyle, and pharmacological factors) to pathologic phenotypes. The integration of microbiology into the MPE model (microbiology-MPE) can contribute to better understanding of the interactive role of environment, tumor cells, immune cells, and microbiome in various diseases. We review major clinical and experimental studies on the microbiome, and describe emerging evidence from the microbiology-MPE research in gastrointestinal cancers. Together with basic experimental research, this new research paradigm can help us to develop new prevention and treatment strategies for gastrointestinal cancers through targeting of the microbiome.

## Faecal microbiota transplantation: what's beyond Clostridium difficile infection?
 12.11.2020, _AG Tamilarasan, T Krishnananthan_


Over the last decade, major advancements have been made in our understanding of both the beneficial and detrimental role that microorganisms play in our innate functioning. Research into the intestinal microbiota has moved from the laboratory into our medical clinics and is being put forth as an effective therapy for a range of medical conditions, not only limited to the gastrointestinal system. The clearest example of this progression has been in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection; however, faecal microbiota transplantation has also been shown to have a positive effect in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, such as ulcerative colitis. In this review article, we will appraise the existing literature examining the role the intestinal microbiota plays in the pathogenesis of disease and the therapeutic utility of faecal microbiota transplantation in restoring homeostasis. In many cases, these studies are in a preclinical setting, are small in scale and often are not placebo-controlled; however, the results from these studies report interesting associations between intestinal dysbiosis and disease development, as well as the beneficial effects of faecal microbiota transplantation in reversing this process.

## A bridge for short-chain fatty acids to affect inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease positively: by changing gut barrier.
 12.11.2020, _W Liu, X Luo, J Tang, Q Mo, H Zhong, H Zhang, F Feng_


In previous studies, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been found to regulate gut microbiota and change gut barrier status, and the potential positive effects of SCFAs on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have also been found, but the role of SCFAs in these three diseases is not clear. This review aims to summarize existing evidence on the effects of SCFAs on IBD, T1D, and NHFLD, and correlates them with gut barrier and gut microbiota (gut microbiota barrier).

## Mucin-Degrading Microbes Release Monosaccharides That Chemoattract Clostridioides difficile and Facilitate Colonization of the Human Intestinal Mucus Layer.
 12.11.2020, _MA Engevik, AC Engevik, KA Engevik, JM Auchtung, AL Chang-Graham, W Ruan, RA Luna, JM Hyser, JK Spinler, J Versalovic_


It is widely accepted that the pathogen Clostridioides difficile exploits an intestinal environment with an altered microbiota, but the details of these microbe-microbe interactions are unclear. Adherence and colonization of mucus has been demonstrated for several enteric pathogens and it is possible that mucin-associated microbes may be working in concert with C. difficile. We showed that C. difficile ribotype-027 adheres to MUC2 glycans and using fecal bioreactors, we identified that C. difficile associates with several mucin-degrading microbes. C. difficile was found to chemotax toward intestinal mucus and its glycan components, demonstrating that C. difficile senses the mucus layer. Although C. difficile lacks the glycosyl hydrolases required to degrade mucin glycans, coculturing C. difficile with the mucin-degrading Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Ruminococcus torques allowed C. difficile to grow in media that lacked glucose but contained purified MUC2. Collectively, these studies expand our knowledge on how intestinal microbes support C. difficile.

## The gut microbiome drives inter- and intra-individual differences in metabolism of bioactive small molecules.
 12.11.2020, _A Kerimi, NU Kraut, JA da Encarnacao, G Williamson_


The origin of inter-individual variability in the action of bioactive small molecules from the diet is poorly understood and poses a substantial obstacle to harnessing their potential for attenuating disease risk. Epidemiological studies show that coffee lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, independently of caffeine, but since coffee is a complex matrix, consumption gives rise to different classes of metabolites in vivo which in turn can affect multiple related pathways in disease development. We quantified key urinary coffee phenolic acid metabolites repeated three times in 36 volunteers, and observed the highest inter- and intra-individual variation for metabolites produced by the colonic microbiome. Notably, a urinary phenolic metabolite not requiring the action of the microbiota was positively correlated with fasting plasma insulin. These data highlight the role of the gut microbiota as the main driver of both intra- and inter-individual variation in metabolism of dietary bioactive small molecules.

## Lower airway dysbiosis affects lung cancer progression.
 12.11.2020, _JJ Tsay, BG Wu, I Sulaiman, K Gershner, R Schluger, Y Li, TA Yie, P Meyn, E Olsen, L Perez, B Franca, J Carpenito, T Iizumi, M El-Ashmawy, M Badri, JT Morton, N Shen, L He, G Michaud, S Rafeq, JL Bessich, RL Smith, H Sauthoff, K Felner, R Pillai, AM Zavitsanou, SB Koralov, V Mezzano, CA Loomis, AL Moreira, W Moore, A Tsirigos, A Heguy, WN Rom, DH Sterman, HI Pass, JC Clemente, H Li, R Bonneau, KK Wong, T Papagiannakopoulos, LN Segal_


In lung cancer, enrichment of the lower airway microbiota with oral commensals commonly occurs and ex vivo models support that some of these bacteria can trigger host transcriptomic signatures associated with carcinogenesis. Here, we show that this lower airway dysbiotic signature was more prevalent in group IIIB-IV TNM stage lung cancer and is associated with poor prognosis, as shown by decreased survival among subjects with early stage disease (I-IIIA) and worse tumor progression as measured by RECIST scores among subjects with IIIB-IV stage disease. In addition, this lower airway microbiota signature was associated with upregulation of IL-17, PI3K, MAPK and ERK pathways in airway transcriptome, and we identified Veillonella parvula as the most abundant taxon driving this association. In a KP lung cancer model, lower airway dysbiosis with V. parvula led to decreased survival, increased tumor burden, IL-17 inflammatory phenotype and activation of checkpoint inhibitor markers.

## Delivery mode and gut microbial changes correlate with an increased risk of childhood asthma.

There have been reports of associations between cesarean section delivery and the risk of childhood asthma, potentially mediated through changes in the gut microbiota. We followed 700 children in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010 (COPSAC2010) cohort prospectively from birth. We examined the effects of cesarean section delivery on gut microbial composition by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing during the first year of life. We then explored whether gut microbial perturbations due to delivery mode were associated with a risk of developing asthma in the first 6 years of life. Delivery by cesarean section was accompanied by marked changes in gut microbiota composition at one week and one month of age, but by one year of age only minor differences persisted compared to vaginal delivery. Increased asthma risk was found in children born by cesarean section only if their gut microbiota composition at 1 year of age still retained a cesarean section microbial signature, suggesting that appropriate maturation of the gut microbiota could mitigate against the increased asthma risk associated with gut microbial changes due to cesarean section delivery.

## Intestinal Microbiota in Children With Symptomatic Dientamoeba fragilis Infection: A Case-control Study.

Dientamoeba fragilis in children has been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, like abdominal pain and diarrhea. The mechanism underlying these symptoms in children with D. fragilis remains unclear. We hypothesized that concomitant microbial alterations, which have been described in other parasitic infections, may be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in D. fragilis.

## A polysaccharide from Fagopyrum esculentum Moench bee pollen alleviates microbiota dysbiosis to improve intestinal barrier function in antibiotic-treated mice.
 12.11.2020, _L Zhu, J Li, C Wei, T Luo, Z Deng, Y Fan, L Zheng_


Antibiotics are the most commonly used clinical drugs for anti-infection, but they can also destroy normal microorganisms and cause intestinal barrier dysfunction. To elucidate the effects and mechanism of a water-soluble polysaccharide from Fagopyrum esculentum Moench bee pollen (WFPP) on intestinal barrier integrity in antibiotic-treated mice, BALB/c mice were exposed to a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone) or not (control), and were administered low-, medium- and high-dose WFFP (100 mg kg-1, 200 mg kg-1 and 400 mg kg-1, respectively) daily by oral gavage for 3 weeks. Mice treated with ceftriaxone displayed symptoms of growth retardation, atrophy of immune organs including thymus and spleen, increased gut permeability, and intestinal barrier damage, which were restored after intervention with WFFP at different doses. Moreover, the beneficial effects of WFFP were closely associated with enhanced intestinal sIgA secretion and reduced inflammatory response. Furthermore 16S rDNA gene sequencing revealed that WFPP elevated microbial diversity and richness and changed the community structure, therefore, alleviating microbiota dysbiosis caused by ceftriaxone. Interestingly, WFPP could modulate the abundance of sIgA secretion-related bacteria (e.g. Proteobacteria) and inflammation-related bacteria (e.g. Enterococcus). Therefore, WFPP can relieve antibiotic-induced microbiota dysbiosis to improve intestinal barrier integrity by increasing intestinal sIgA secretion and inhibiting inflammation.

## COVID-19 in the Developing World: Is the Immune Response to α-Gal an Overlooked Factor Mitigating the Severity of Infection?
 12.11.2020, _A Hodžić, J de la Fuente, A Cabezas-Cruz_


Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has affected millions of people worldwide. Considerably lower prevalence and fatality rates resulting from COVID-19 are reported in Africa and Asia than in the industrialized world. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the possibility that this intriguing phenomenon could be, among other factors, due to protective immunity of the oligosaccharide galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal). The α-Gal immunity induced by gut microbiota that express the same glycan modification may prevent COVID-19 through the activation of different mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and the downregulation of the inflammatory response in the lungs of infected patients.

## Gut microbiota depletion by chronic antibiotic treatment alters the sleep/wake architecture and sleep EEG power spectra in mice.

Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota affects physiological processes, including brain functions, by altering the intestinal metabolism. Here we examined the effects of the gut microbiota on sleep/wake regulation. C57BL/6 male mice were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for 4 weeks to deplete their gut microbiota. Metabolome profiling of cecal contents in antibiotic-induced microbiota-depleted (AIMD) and control mice showed significant variations in the metabolism of amino acids and vitamins related to neurotransmission, including depletion of serotonin and vitamin B6, in the AIMD mice. Sleep analysis based on electroencephalogram and electromyogram recordings revealed that AIMD mice spent significantly less time in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) during the light phase while spending more time in NREMS and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) during the dark phase. The number of REMS episodes seen in AIMD mice increased during both light and dark phases, and this was accompanied by frequent transitions from NREMS to REMS. In addition, the theta power density during REMS was lower in AIMD mice during the light phase compared with that in the controls. Consequently, the gut microbiota is suggested to affect the sleep/wake architecture by altering the intestinal balance of neurotransmitters.

## Comparison of different modes of antibiotic delivery on gut microbiota depletion efficiency and body composition in mouse.
 12.11.2020, _P Tirelle, J Breton, G Riou, P Déchelotte, M Coëffier, D Ribet_


The use of animal models with depleted intestinal microbiota has recently increased thanks to the huge interest in the potential role of these micro-organisms in human health. In particular, depletion of gut bacteria using antibiotics has recently become popular as it represents a low cost and easy alternative to germ-free animals. Various regimens of antibiotics are used in the literature, which differ in composition, dose, length of treatment and mode of administration. In order to help investigators in choosing the most appropriate protocol for their studies, we compared here three modes of antibiotic delivery to deplete gut bacteria in C57Bl/6 mice. We delivered one of the most frequently used combination of antibiotics (a mix of ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole and vancomycin) either ad libitum in drinking water or by oral gavage once or twice per day.

## Plant resistome profiling in evolutionary old bog vegetation provides new clues to understand emergence of multi-resistance.
 12.11.2020, _MM Obermeier, WA Wicaksono, J Taffner, A Bergna, A Poehlein, T Cernava, S Lindstaedt, M Lovric, CA Müller Bogotá, G Berg_


The expanding antibiotic resistance crisis calls for a more in depth understanding of the importance of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in pristine environments. We, therefore, studied the microbiome associated with Sphagnum moss forming the main vegetation in undomesticated, evolutionary old bog ecosystems. In our complementary analysis of culture collections, metagenomic data and a fosmid library from different geographic sites in Europe, we identified a low abundant but highly diverse pool of resistance determinants, which targets an unexpectedly broad range of 29 antibiotics including natural and synthetic compounds. This derives both, from the extraordinarily high abundance of efflux pumps (up to 96%), and the unexpectedly versatile set of ARGs underlying all major resistance mechanisms. Multi-resistance was frequently observed among bacterial isolates, e.g. in Serratia, Rouxiella, Pandoraea, Paraburkholderia and Pseudomonas. In a search for novel ARGs, we identified the new class A β-lactamase Mm3. The native Sphagnum resistome comprising a highly diversified and partially novel set of ARGs contributes to the bog ecosystem´s plasticity. Our results reinforce the ecological link between natural and clinically relevant resistomes and thereby shed light onto this link from the aspect of pristine plants. Moreover, they underline that diverse resistomes are an intrinsic characteristic of plant-associated microbial communities, they naturally harbour many resistances including genes with potential clinical relevance.

## A network-based approach to deciphering a dynamic microbiome's response to a subtle perturbation.
 12.11.2020, _GT Shaw, AC Liu, CY Weng, YC Chen, CY Chen, FC Weng, D Wang, CY Chou_


Over the past decades, one main issue that has emerged in ecological and environmental research is how losses in biodiversity influence ecosystem dynamics and functioning, and consequently human society. Although biodiversity is a common indicator of ecosystem functioning, it is difficult to measure biodiversity in microbial communities exposed to subtle or chronic environmental perturbations. Consequently, there is a need for alternative bioindicators to detect, measure, and monitor gradual changes in microbial communities against these slight, chronic, and continuous perturbations. In this study, microbial networks before and after subtle perturbations by adding S. acidaminiphila showed diverse topological niches and 4-node motifs in which microbes with co-occurrence patterns played the central roles in regulating and adjusting the intertwined relationships among microorganisms in response to the subtle environmental changes. This study demonstrates that microbial networks are a good bioindicator for chronic perturbation and should be applied in a variety of ecological investigations.

## A comprehensive investigation of metagenome assembly by linked-read sequencing.
 12.11.2020, _L Zhang, X Fang, H Liao, Z Zhang, X Zhou, L Han, Y Chen, Q Qiu, SC Li_


The human microbiota are complex systems with important roles in our physiological activities and diseases. Sequencing the microbial genomes in the microbiota can help in our interpretation of their activities. The vast majority of the microbes in the microbiota cannot be isolated for individual sequencing. Current metagenomics practices use short-read sequencing to simultaneously sequence a mixture of microbial genomes. However, these results are in ambiguity during genome assembly, leading to unsatisfactory microbial genome completeness and contig continuity. Linked-read sequencing is able to remove some of these ambiguities by attaching the same barcode to the reads from a long DNA fragment (10-100 kb), thus improving metagenome assembly. However, it is not clear how the choices for several parameters in the use of linked-read sequencing affect the assembly quality.

## Light-Activated Electron Transfer and Catalytic Mechanism of Carnitine Oxidation by Rieske-type Oxygenase from Human Microbiota.
 12.11.2020, _M Shanmugam, M Quareshy, A Cameron, TDH Bugg, Y Chen_


Multi-component, non-heme iron-dependent oxygenases catalyse a range of biochemical processes, as extensive as those found in heme chemistry. Oxidation of quaternary ammonium substrate carnitine by Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) oxygenase CntA/ reductase CntB is implicated in the onset of human cardiovascular disease. However, detailed mechanistic understanding of the CntAB reaction is not known. Here, we develop a blue-light (365 nm) activation of NADH coupled to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements to study electron transfer from the excited state of NADH to the oxidised, Rieske-type, [2Fe-2S] 2+ cluster in the AbCntA oxygenase domain with and without the substrate, carnitine. Further electron transfer from one-electron reduced, Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] 1+ centre in AbCntA-WT to the mono-nuclear, non-heme iron centre via the bridging glutamate E205 and subsequent catalysis occurs only in the presence of carnitine. The reaction mechanism for photoactivated, NADH-driven carnitine oxidation is different from the reaction driven by the AbCntB reductase partner. The electron transfer process in the AbCntA-E205A mutant is severely affected, which plausibly accounts for the significant loss of catalytic activity in the AbCntA-E205A mutant. The NADH photo-activation coupled with EPR is broadly applicable to trap reactive intermediates at low temperature and creates a new method to characterise elusive intermediates in multiple redox-centre containing proteins.

## Microbial communities and gene contributions in smokeless tobacco products.
 12.11.2020, _AJ Rivera, RE Tyx, LM Keong, SB Stanfill, CH Watson_


Smokeless tobacco products (STP) contain bacteria, mold, and fungi due to exposure from surrounding environments and tobacco processing. This has been a cause for concern since the presence of microorganisms has been linked to the formation of highly carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines. These communities have also been reported to produce toxins and other pro-inflammatory molecules that can cause mouth lesions and elicit inflammatory responses in STP users. Moreover, microbial species in these products could transfer to the mouth and gastrointestinal tract, potentially altering the established respective microbiotas of the consumer. Here, we present the first metagenomic analysis of select smokeless tobacco products, specifically US domestic moist and dry snuff. Bacterial, eukaryotic, and viral species were found in all tobacco products where 68% of the total species was comprised of Bacteria with 3 dominant phyla but also included 32% Eukarya and 1% share abundance for Archaea and Viruses. Furthermore, 693,318 genes were found to be present and included nitrate and nitrite reduction and transport enzymes, antibiotic resistance genes associated with resistance to vancomycin, β-lactamases, their derivatives, and other antibiotics, as well as genes encoding multi-drug transporters and efflux pumps. Additional analyses showed the presence of endo- and exotoxin genes in addition to other molecules associated with inflammatory responses. Our results present a novel aspect of the smokeless tobacco microbiome and provide a better understanding of these products' microbiology. KEY POINTS: • The findings presented will help understand microbial contributions to overall STP chemistries. • Gene function categorization reveals harmful constituents outside canonical forms. • Pathway genes for TSNA precursor activity may occur at early stages of production. • Bacteria in STPs carry antibiotic resistance genes and gene transfer mechanisms.
