## Differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome based on metagenomic analysis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
 19.07.2021, _H Fan, X Hong, J Zeng, X Wang, J Chen_


_Acupuncture Therapy, Clomiphene, Female, Humans, Menstruation, Obesity, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic_
Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common cause of infertility and shows a high incidence in women of reproductive age. Acupuncture is an appropriate adjunctive treatment for PCOS. However, the add-on effect of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for obese women with PCOS has not been studied, and previous studies indicate that there are individual differences in the curative effect of acupuncture, while deeper research on the mechanism of differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS is still lacking. This trial aims to assess the add-on treatment efficacy of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS and to explore the role of the gut microbiome on the differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture based on metagenomic analysis.

## Assessment and characterization of tomato lipophilic electrophiles and their potential contribution to nutraceutical properties via SKN-1/Nrf2 signaling activation.
 20.07.2021, _ADV Carranza, G Bonacci, Y Moran, P Asprelli, F Carrari, R Asis_


Phytochemical electrophiles are drawing significant attention due to their properties to modulate signaling pathways related to cellular homeostasis. The aim of this study was to develop new tools to examine the electrophilic activity in food and predict their beneficial effects on health. We developed a spectrophotometric assay based on the nitrobenzenethiol (NBT) reactivity, as a thiol-reactive nucleophile, to screen electrophiles in tomato fruits. The method is robust, simple, inexpensive, and could be applied to other types of food. We quantified the electrophile activity in a tomato collection and associated this activity with the pigment composition. Thus, we identified lycopene, β- and γ-carotenes, 16 by-products of carotenoid oxidation and 18 unknown compounds as NBT-reactive by HPLC-MS/MS. The potential benefits of NBT-reactive compounds on health were evaluated in the in vivo model of C. elegans where they activated the SKN-1/Nrf2 pathway, evidencing the ability of electrophilic compounds to induce a biological response.

## Trojan horses and tunneling nanotubes enable α-synuclein pathology to spread in Parkinson disease.
 20.07.2021, _S Rajasekaran, SN Witt_


In Parkinson disease (PD), Lewy bodies (LBs) form in the gut or nose and spread into the midbrain. A study in this issue indicates that the spread is due to lysosomes "infected" with prion-like alpha-synuclein (α-syn) transmitting from cell to cell via tunneling nanotubes (TNTs).

## Identification of pathogen(s) in infectious diseases using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and conventional culture: a comparative study.
 13.07.2021, _H Chen, J Li, S Yan, H Sun, C Tan, M Liu, K Liu, H Zhang, M Zou, X Xiao_


Early and accurate diagnosis of microorganism(s) is important to optimize antimicrobial therapy. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing technology, an unbiased and comprehensive method for pathogen identification, seems to potentially assist or even replace conventional microbiological methodology in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. However, evidence in clinical application of this platform is relatively limited.

## Predicting antibiotic resistance gene abundance in activated sludge using shotgun metagenomics and machine learning.
 20.07.2021, _Y Sun, B Clarke, J Clarke, X Li_


While the microbiome of activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) plays a vital role in shaping the resistome, identifying the potential bacterial hosts of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in WWTPs remains challenging. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using a machine learning approach, random forests (RF's), to identify the strength of associations between ARGs and bacterial taxa in metagenomic datasets from the activated sludge of WWTPs. Our results show that the abundance of select ARGs can be predicted by RF's using abundant genera (Candidatus Accumulibacter, Dechloromonas, Pesudomonas, and Thauera, etc.), (opportunistic) pathogens and indicators (Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Streptococcus, etc.), and nitrifiers (Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira, etc.) as explanatory variables. The correlations between predicted and observed abundance of ARGs (erm(B), tet(O), tet(Q), etc.) ranged from medium (0.400 &lt; R2 &lt; 0.600) to strong (R2 &gt; 0.600) when validated on testing datasets. Compared to those belonging to the other two groups, individual genera in the group of (opportunistic) pathogens and indicator bacteria had more positive functional relationships with select ARGs, suggesting genera in this group (e.g., Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Streptococcus) may be hosts of select ARGs. Furthermore, RF's with (opportunistic) pathogens and indicators as explanatory variables were used to predict the abundance of select ARGs in a full-scale WWTP successfully. Machine learning approaches such as RF's can potentially identify bacterial hosts of ARGs and reveal possible functional relationships between the ARGs and microbial community in the AS of WWTPs.

Ruminants rely upon a complex community of microbes in their rumen to convert host-indigestible feed into nutrients. However, little is known about the association between the rumen microbiota and feed efficiency traits in Nellore (Bos indicus) cattle, a breed of major economic importance to the global beef market. Here, we compare the composition of the bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the rumen of Nellore steers with high and low feed efficiency (FE) phenotypes, as measured by residual feed intake (RFI).

Computational methods are key in microbiome research, and obtaining a quantitative and unbiased performance estimate is important for method developers and applied researchers. For meaningful comparisons between methods, to identify best practices and common use cases, and to reduce overhead in benchmarking, it is necessary to have standardized datasets, procedures and metrics for evaluation. In this tutorial, we describe emerging standards in computational meta-omics benchmarking derived and agreed upon by a larger community of researchers. Specifically, we outline recent efforts by the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) initiative, which supplies method developers and applied researchers with exhaustive quantitative data about software performance in realistic scenarios and organizes community-driven benchmarking challenges. We explain the most relevant evaluation metrics for assessing metagenome assembly, binning and profiling results, and provide step-by-step instructions on how to generate them. The instructions use simulated mouse gut metagenome data released in preparation for the second round of CAMI challenges and showcase the use of a repository of tool results for CAMI datasets. This tutorial will serve as a reference for the community and facilitate informative and reproducible benchmarking in microbiome research.

The ocean microbiota modulates global biogeochemical cycles and changes in its configuration may have large-scale consequences. Yet, the underlying ecological mechanisms structuring it are unclear. Here, we investigate how fundamental ecological mechanisms (selection, dispersal and ecological drift) shape the smallest members of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota: prokaryotes and minute eukaryotes (picoeukaryotes). Furthermore, we investigate the agents exerting abiotic selection on this assemblage as well as the spatial patterns emerging from the action of ecological mechanisms. To explore this, we analysed the composition of surface-ocean prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities using DNA-sequence data (16S- and 18S-rRNA genes) collected during the circumglobal expeditions Malaspina-2010 and TARA-Oceans.
