Microbiota play critical roles in regulating colitis and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is unclear how the microbiota generate protective immunity against these disease states. Here, we find that loss of the innate and adaptive immune signaling molecule, TAK1, in myeloid cells (Tak1ΔM/ΔM) yields complete resistance to chemical-induced colitis and CRC through microbiome alterations that drive protective immunity. Tak1ΔM/ΔM mice exhibit altered microbiota that are critical for resistance, with antibiotic-mediated disruption ablating protection and Tak1ΔM/ΔM microbiota transfer conferring protection against colitis or CRC. The altered microbiota of Tak1ΔM/ΔM mice promote IL-1β and IL-6 signaling pathways, which are required for induction of protective intestinal Th17 cells and resistance. Specifically, Odoribacter splanchnicus is abundant in Tak1ΔM/ΔM mice and sufficient to induce intestinal Th17 cell development and confer resistance against colitis and CRC in wild-type mice. These findings identify specific microbiota strains and immune mechanisms that protect against colitis and CRC.

## Impact of Maternal Nutritional Supplementation during Pregnancy and Lactation on the Infant Gut or Breastmilk Microbiota: A Systematic Review.
 28.04.2021, _AZ Zaidi, SE Moore, SG Okala_


Recent evidence indicates that maternal dietary intake, including dietary supplements, during pregnancy and lactation may alter the infant gut or breastmilk microbiota, with implications for health outcomes in both the mother and infant. To review the effects of maternal nutritional supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the infant gut or breastmilk microbiota a systematic literature search was conducted. A total of 967 studies published until February 2020 were found, 31 were eligible and 29 randomized control trials were included in the qualitative synthesis. There were 23 studies that investigated the effects of probiotic supplementation, with the remaining studies investigating vitamin D, prebiotics or lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS). The effects of maternal nutritional supplementation on the infant gut microbiota or breastmilk microbiota were examined in 21 and 12 studies, respectively. Maternal probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and lactation generally resulted in the probiotic colonization of the infant gut microbiota, and although most studies also reported alterations in the infant gut bacterial loads, there was limited evidence of effects on bacterial diversity. The data available show that maternal probiotic supplementation during pregnancy or lactation results in probiotic colonization of the breastmilk microbiota. There were no observed effects between probiotic supplementation and breastmilk bacterial counts of healthy women, however, administration of Lactobacillus probiotic to nursing women affected by mastitis was associated with significant reductions in breastmilk Staphylococcal loads. Maternal LNS supplementation during pregnancy and lactation increased bacterial diversity in the infant gut, whilst vitamin D and prebiotic supplementation did not alter either infant gut bacterial diversity or counts. Heterogeneity in study design precludes any firm conclusions on the effects of maternal nutritional supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the infant gut or breastmilk microbiota, warranting further research.

## Multi-omics study reveals that statin therapy is associated with restoration of gut microbiota homeostasis and improvement in outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome.
 28.04.2021, _X Hu, H Li, X Zhao, R Zhou, H Liu, Y Sun, Y Fan, Y Shi, S Qiao, S Liu, H Liu, S Zhang_


Rationale: Prior chronic treatment with statins has been shown to be associated with more favorable outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Specific changes in the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites have been shown to influence the progression of coronary artery disease. However, the critical microbial and metabolomic changes associated with the cardiovascular protective effects of statins in ACS remain elusive. Methods: In the present study, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing and serum metabolomic analysis in 36 ACS patients who had received chronic statin treatment, 67 ACS patients who had not, and 30 healthy volunteers. A follow-up study was conducted. Metagenomic functional prediction of important bacterial taxa was achieved using PICRUSt2. Results: Statins modulated the gut microbiome of ACS patients towards a healthier status, i.e., reducing potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Parabacteroides merdae but increasing beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Anaerostipes hadrus and Ruminococcus obeum. Moreover, prior chronic statin therapy was associated with improved outcome in ACS patients. Multi-omics analysis revealed that specific changes in bacterial taxa were associated with disease severity or outcomes either directly or by mediating metabolites such as fatty acids and prenol lipids. Finally, we discovered that important taxa associated with statins were correlated with fatty acid- and isoprenoid-related pathways that were predicted by PICRUSt2. Conclusions: Our study suggests that statin treatment might benefit ACS patients by modulating the composition and function of the gut microbiome, which might result in improved circulating metabolites and reduced metabolic risk. Our findings provide new insights for understanding the heterogenic roles of statins in ACS patients through host gut microbiota metabolic interactions.

## Sargassum fusiforme fucoidan modifies gut microbiota and intestinal metabolites during alleviation of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic mice.
 27.04.2021, _Q Wu, S Wu, Y Cheng, Z Zhang, G Mao, S Li, Y Yang, X Zhang, M Wu, H Tong_


Type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) is a complicated metabolic disorder that is now considered as a major global public health problem. Fucoidan exhibits diverse biological activities, especially prevention of metabolic diseases. In this regard, we herein aimed to reveal the beneficial effect of Sargassum fusiforme fucoidan (SFF) on high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) induced T2DM mice. We noted that on the one hand, SFF significantly decreased fasting blood glucose, diet and water intake, and hyperlipidemia, while on the other hand, it improved glucose tolerance. Furthermore, SFF reduced epididymal fat deposition, attenuated the pathological changes in heart and liver tissues, and decreased oxidative stress in diabetic mice. To explore the underlying mechanisms of these ameliorative effects, the gut microbiota was analyzed. Notably, SFF highly enriched benign microbes including Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium and Blautia, as well as increased levels of (R)-carnitine and choline in the colon of diabetic mice. This may be a potential mechanism for alleviating T2DM, thus implying the benefits of SFF as an adjuvant agent for T2DM treatment. Taken together, this study demonstrated a promising application of fucoidan as one of the adjuvant agents for the management of T2DM in the future.

## Bidirectional interaction of nobiletin and gut microbiota in mice fed with a high-fat diet.
 27.04.2021, _M Zhang, X Zhang, J Zhu, DG Zhao, YY Ma, D Li, CT Ho, Q Huang_


Nobiletin is abundant in citrus peels and demonstrates good anti-obesity bioactivity. However, its anti-obesity mechanisms still remain unclear. This study aims to explore the bidirectional interaction between nobiletin and gut microbiota in mice fed with a high-fat diet. For the colonic bioconversion, more demethylated metabolites with higher biological activity were found in feces than nobiletin in the 48 h excretion study and 8 week consecutive dosing study. Moreover, long-term oral intake of nobiletin would modify the gut microbiota with improved demethylation ability and enhanced production of short chain fatty acids. The comparison of metabolite profiles in mouse liver and feces indicated that gut microbiota might have a higher biotransformation activity on nobiletin than the host. Two bacteria at the genus level, Allobaculum and Roseburia, remained enriched by nobiletin after the 4- and 8-week feedings. They might correlate with the enhanced nobiletin biotransformation and actively contribute to the health benefits of nobiletin in vivo. These results suggested that the bidirectional interaction of nobiletin and gut microbiota played an important role on the anti-obesity effect of nobiletin.

## Reshaping of the gastrointestinal microbiome alters atherosclerotic plaque inflammation resolution in mice.
 27.04.2021, _MS Garshick, C Nikain, M Tawil, S Pena, TJ Barrett, BG Wu, Z Gao, MJ Blaser, EA Fisher_


Since alterations in the intestinal microbiota may induce systemic inflammation and polarization of macrophages to the M1 state, the microbiome role in atherosclerosis, an M1-driven disease, requires evaluation. We aimed to determine if antibiotic (Abx) induced alterations to the intestinal microbiota interferes with atherosclerotic plaque inflammation resolution after lipid-lowering in mice. Hyperlipidemic Apoe-/- mice were fed a western diet to develop aortic atherosclerosis with aortas then transplanted into normolipidemic wild-type (WT) mice to model clinically aggressive lipid management and promote atherosclerosis inflammation resolution. Gut microbial composition pre and post-transplant was altered via an enteral antibiotic or not. Post aortic transplant, after Abx treatment, while plaque size did not differ, compared to Apoe-/- mice, Abx- WT recipient mice had a 32% reduction in CD68-expressing cells (p = 0.02) vs. a non-significant 12% reduction in Abx+ WT mice. A trend toward an M1 plaque CD68-expresing cell phenotype was noted in Abx+ mice. By 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the Abx+ mice had reduced alpha diversity and increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes relative abundance ratio with a correlation between gut Firmicutes abundance and plaque CD68-expressing cell content (p &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that in a murine atherosclerotic plaque inflammation resolution model, antibiotic-induced microbiome perturbation may blunt the effectiveness of lipid-lowering to reduce the content of plaque inflammatory CD68-expressing cells.

## Gut bacterial communities across 12 Ensifera (Orthoptera) at different feeding habits and its prediction for the insect with contrasting feeding habits.
 26.04.2021, _X Zheng, Q Zhu, Z Zhou, F Wu, L Chen, Q Cao, F Shi_


Insect microbial symbioses play a critical role in insect lifecycle, and insect gut microbiome could be influenced by many factors. Studies have shown that host diet and taxonomy have a strong influence on insect gut microbial community. In this study, we performed sequencing of V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene to compare the composition and diversity of 12 Ensifera from 6 provinces of China. Moreover, the influences of feeding habits and taxonomic status of insects on their gut bacterial community were evaluated, which might provide reference for further application research. The results showed that Proteobacteria (45.66%), Firmicutes (34.25%) and Cyanobacteria (7.7%) were the predominant bacterial phyla in Ensifera. Moreover, the gut bacterial community composition of samples with different feeding habits was significantly different, which was irrespective of their taxa. The highest diversity of gut bacteria was found in the omnivorous Ensifera. Furthermore, common and unique bacteria with biomarkers were found based on the dietary characteristics of the samples. However, the bacterial community structure of the Ensifera samples was significantly different from that of Caelifera. Therefore, we concluded that feeding habits and taxonomic status jointly affect the gut bacterial community composition of the samples from Orthoptera. However, the influence of feeding habit dominates when taxonomy category below the suborder level. In addition, the dominant, common and unique bacterial community structure could be used to predict the contrastic feeding habits of insects belonging to Ensifera.

## Impacts of radiation exposure on the bacterial and fungal microbiome of small mammals in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
 26.04.2021, _RE Antwis, NA Beresford, JA Jackson, R Fawkes, CL Barnett, E Potter, L Walker, S Gaschak, MD Wood_


Environmental impacts of the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident are much debated, but the effects of radiation on host microbiomes have received little attention to date. We present the first analysis of small mammal gut microbiome from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in relation to total absorbed dose rate and including caecum as well as faeces sample. We provide novel evidence that host species determines fungal community composition, and that associations between microbiome (both bacterial and fungal) communities and radiation exposure varies between host species. Using ambient versus total weighted absorbed dose rates in analyses produced different results, with the latter more robust for interpreting microbiome changes at the individual level. We found considerable variation between results for faecal and gut samples of bank voles, suggesting faecal samples are not an accurate indicator of gut composition. Associations between radiation exposure and microbiome composition of gut samples were not robust against geographical variation, although we identified families of bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Muribaculaceae) and fungi (Steccherinaceae and Strophariaceae) in the guts of bank voles that may serve as biomarkers of radiation exposure. Further studies considering a range of small mammal species are needed to establish the robustness of these potential biomarkers.

The Black Sea is the largest brackish water body in the world, although it is connected to the Mediterranean Sea and presents an upper water layer similar to some regions of the former, albeit with lower salinity and temperature. Despite its well-known hydrology and physicochemical features, this enormous water mass remains poorly studied at the microbial genomics level.

## Obtaining deeper insights into microbiome diversity using a simple method to block host and non-targets in amplicon sequencing.
 27.04.2021, _T Mayer, A Mari, J Almario, M Murillo-Roos, HSM Abdullah, N Dombrowski, S Hacquard, EM Kemen, MT Agler_


Profiling diverse microbiomes is revolutionizing our understanding of biological mechanisms and ecologically relevant problems, including metaorganism (host+microbiome) assembly, functions and adaptation. Amplicon sequencing of multiple conserved, phylogenetically informative loci has therefore become an instrumental tool for many researchers. Investigations in many systems are hindered, however, since essential sequencing depth can be lost by amplification of non-target DNA from hosts or overabundant microorganisms. Here, we introduce "blocking oligos", a low-cost and flexible method using standard oligonucleotides to block amplification of diverse non-targets and software to aid their design. We apply them primarily in leaves, where exceptional challenges with host amplification prevail. A. thaliana-specific blocking oligos applied in eight different target loci reduce undesirable host amplification by up to 90%. To expand applicability, we designed "universal" 16S and 18S rRNA gene plant blocking oligos for targets that are conserved in diverse plant species and demonstrate that they efficiently block five plant species from five orders spanning monocots and dicots (Bromus erectus, Plantago lanceolata, Lotus corniculatus, Amaranth spec., Arabidopsis thaliana). These can increase alpha diversity discovery without biasing beta diversity patterns and do not compromise microbial load information inherent to plant-derived 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data. Finally, we designed and tested blocking oligos to avoid amplification of 18S rRNA genes of a sporulating oomycete pathogen, demonstrating their effectiveness in applications well beyond plants. Using these tools, we generated a survey of the A. thaliana leaf microbiome based on eight loci targeting bacterial, fungal, oomycete and other eukaryotic microorganisms and discuss complementarity of commonly used amplicon sequencing regions for describing leaf microbiota. This approach has potential to make questions in a variety of study systems more tractable by making amplicon sequencing more targeted, leading to deeper, systems-based insights into microbial discovery. For fast and easy design for blocking oligos for any non-target DNA in other study systems, we developed a publicly available R package.
