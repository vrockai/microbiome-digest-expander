_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Eurotium Cristatum reduces obesity by alleviating gut microbiota dysbiosis and modulating lipid and energy metabolism.
 12.06.2022, _B Zhang, D Ren, A Zhao, Y Cheng, Y Liu, Y Zhao, X Yang_


Fuzhuan brick tea (FBT) has been shown to prevent obesity, but little is known about the effect of Eurotium Cristatum (E. Cristatum), a critical fungus from FBT. This study examined the effects of live E. Cristatum on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota composition in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese mice.

Semi-quantitative bacterial culture is the reference standard to diagnose urinary tract infection, but culture is time-consuming and can be unreliable if patients are receiving antibiotics. Metagenomics could increase diagnostic accuracy and speed by sequencing the microbiota and resistome directly from urine. We aimed to compare metagenomics to culture for semi-quantitative pathogen and resistome detection from urine.

## Host hepatic metabolism is modulated by gut microbiota-derived sphingolipids.
 13.06.2022, _HH Le, MT Lee, KR Besler, EL Johnson_


_Animals, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Liver, Mice, Microbiota, Sphingolipids_
Microbially-derived gut metabolites are important contributors to host phenotypes, many of which may link microbiome composition to metabolic disease. However, relatively few metabolites with known bioactivity have been traced from specific microbes to host tissues. Here, we use a labeling strategy to characterize and trace bacterial sphingolipids from the gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to mouse colons and livers. We find that bacterial sphingolipid synthesis rescues excess lipid accumulation in a mouse model of hepatic steatosis and observe the transit of a previously uncharacterized bacterial sphingolipid to the liver. The addition of this sphingolipid to hepatocytes improves respiration in response to fatty-acid overload, suggesting that sphingolipid transfer to the liver could potentially contribute to microbiota-mediated liver function. This work establishes a role for bacterial sphingolipids in modulating hepatic phenotypes and defines a workflow that permits the characterization of other microbial metabolites with undefined functions in host health.

## Linking gastrointestinal microbiota and metabolome dynamics to clinical outcomes in paediatric haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
 13.06.2022, _G Vaitkute, G Panic, DG Alber, I Faizura-Yeop, E Cloutman-Green, J Swann, P Veys, JF Standing, N Klein, M Bajaj-Elliott_


Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a curative procedure for a variety of conditions. Despite major advances, a plethora of adverse clinical outcomes can develop post-transplantation including graft-versus-host disease and infections, which remain the major causes of morbidity and mortality. There is increasing evidence that the gastrointestinal microbiota is associated with clinical outcomes post-haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Herein, we investigated the longitudinal dynamics of the gut microbiota and metabolome and potential associations to clinical outcomes in paediatric haematopoietic stem cell transplantation at a single centre.

## Symbiont Community Composition in Rimicaris kairei Shrimps from Indian Ocean Vents with Notes on Mineralogy.
 01.06.2022, _P Methou, M Hikosaka, C Chen, HK Watanabe, N Miyamoto, H Makita, Y Takahashi, RG Jenkins_


_Animals, Decapoda, Hydrothermal Vents, In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence, Indian Ocean, Microbiota, Symbiosis_
Hydrothermal vent ecosystems are home to a wide array of symbioses between animals and chemosynthetic microbes, among which shrimps in the genus Rimicaris is one of the most iconic. So far, studies of Rimicaris symbioses have been restricted to Atlantic species, including Rimicaris exoculata, which is totally reliant on the symbionts for nutrition, and the mixotrophic species Rimicaris chacei. Here, we expand this by investigating and characterizing the symbiosis of the Indian Ocean species Rimicaris kairei using specimens from two vent fields, Kairei and Edmond. We also aimed to evaluate the differences in mineralogy and microbial communities between two cephalothorax color morphs, black and brown, through a combination of 16S metabarcoding, scanning electron microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and synchrotron near-edge X-ray absorption structure analyses. Overall, our results highlight that R. kairei exhibits similar symbiont lineages to those of its Atlantic congeners, although with a few differences, such as the lack of Zetaproteobacteria. We found distinct mineralization processes behind the two color morphs that were linked to differences in the vent fluid composition, but the symbiotic community composition was surprisingly similar. In R. exoculata, such mineralogical differences have been shown to stem from disparity in the microbial communities, but our results indicate that in R. kairei this is instead due to the shift of dominant metabolisms by the same symbiotic partners. We suggest that a combination of local environmental factors and biogeographic barriers likely contribute to the differences between Atlantic and Indian Ocean Rimicaris symbioses. IMPORTANCE Hydrothermal vent shrimps in the genus Rimicaris are among the most charismatic deep-sea animals of Atlantic and Indian Oceans, often occurring on towering black smokers in dense aggregates of thousands of individuals. Although this dominance is only possible because of symbiosis, no study on the symbiosis of Indian Ocean Rimicaris species has been conducted. Here, we characterize the Rimicaris kairei symbiosis by combining molecular, microscopic, and elemental analyses, making comparisons with those of the Atlantic species possible for the first time. Although most symbiotic partners remained consistent across the two oceans, some differences were recognized in symbiont lineages, as well as in the mechanisms behind the formation of two color morphs with distinct mineralogies. Our results shed new light on relationships among mineralogy, environmental factors, and microbial communities that are useful for understanding other deep-sea symbioses in the future.

## Cyanopeptides restriction and degradation co-mediate microbiota assembly during a freshwater cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (CyanoHAB).
 07.06.2022, _H Gao, Z Zhao, L Zhang, F Ju_


Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are globally intensifying and exacerbated by climate change and eutrophication. However, microbiota assembly mechanisms underlying CyanoHABs remain elusive. Especially, cyanopeptides, as a group of bioactive secondary metabolites of cyanobacteria, could affect microbiota assembly and ecosystem function. Here, the trajectory of cyanopeptides was followed and linked to microbiota during Microcystis-dominated CyanoHABs in Lake Taihu, China. The most abundant cyanopeptide classes detected included microginin, spumigin, microcystin, nodularin and cyanopeptolin with total MC-LR-equivalent concentrations between 0.23 and 2051.54 ppb, of which cyanotoxins beyond microcystins (e.g., cyanostatin B and nodularin_R) far exceeded reported organismal IC50 and negatively correlated with microbiota diversity, exerting potential collective eco-toxicities stronger than microcystins alone. The microbial communities were differentiated by size fraction and sampling date throughout CyanoHABs, and surprisingly, their variances were better explained by cyanopeptides (19-38%) than nutrients (0-16%). Cyanopeptides restriction (e.g., inhibition) and degradation were first quantitatively verified as the deterministic drivers governing community assembly, with stochastic processes being associated with the interplay between cyanopeptide dynamics and lake microbiota. This study presents an emerging paradigm in which cyanopeptides restriction and degradation co-mediate lake water microbiota assembly, unveiling new insights into the ecotoxicological significance of CyanoHABs to freshwater ecosystems.
