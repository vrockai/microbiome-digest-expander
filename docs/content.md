## The microbiota drives diurnal rhythms in tryptophan metabolism in the stressed gut.

Chronic stress disrupts microbiota-gut-brain axis function and is associated with altered tryptophan metabolism, impaired gut barrier function, and disrupted diurnal rhythms. However, little is known about the effects of acute stress on the gut and how it is influenced by diurnal physiology. Here, we used germ-free and antibiotic-depleted mice to understand how microbiota-dependent oscillations in tryptophan metabolism would alter gut barrier function at baseline and in response to an acute stressor. Cecal metabolomics identified tryptophan metabolism as most responsive to a 15-min acute stressor, while shotgun metagenomics revealed that most bacterial species exhibiting rhythmicity metabolize tryptophan. Our findings highlight that the gastrointestinal response to acute stress is dependent on the time of day and the microbiome, with a signature of stress-induced functional alterations in the ileum and altered tryptophan metabolism in the colon.

## Microbiome Analysis Revealed Acholeplasma as a Possible Factor Influencing the Susceptibility to Bacterial Leaf Blight Disease of Two Domestic Rice Cultivars in Vietnam.

The microbiomes of two important rice cultivars in Vietnam which differ by their susceptibility to the bacterial leaf blight (BLB) disease were analyzed through 16S rRNA amplicon technology. A higher number of operational taxonomic units and alpha-diversity indices were shown in the BLB-resistant LA cultivar than in the BLB-susceptible TB cultivar. The BLB pathogen Xanthomonas was scantly found (0.003%) in the LA cultivar, whereas was in a significantly higher ratio in the TB cultivar (1.82%), reflecting the susceptibility to BLB of these cultivars. Of special interest was the genus Acholeplasma presented in the BLB-resistant LA cultivar at a high relative abundance (22.32%), however, was minor in the BLB-sensitive TB cultivar (0.09%), raising a question about its roles in controlling the Xanthomonas low in the LA cultivar. It is proposed that Acholeplasma once entered the host plant would hamper other phytopathogens, i.e. Xanthomonas, by yet unknown mechanisms, of which the triggering of the host plants to produce secondary metabolites against pathogens could be a testable hypothesis.
