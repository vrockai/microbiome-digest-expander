Metabolomic data processing pipelines have been improving in recent years, allowing for greater feature extraction and identification. Lately, machine learning and robust statistical techniques to control false discoveries are being incorporated into metabolomic data analysis. In this paper, we introduce one such recently developed technique called aggregate knockoff filtering to untargeted metabolomic analysis. When applied to a publicly available dataset, aggregate knockoff filtering combined with typical p-value filtering improves the number of significantly changing metabolites by 25% when compared to conventional untargeted metabolomic data processing. By using this method, features that would normally not be extracted under standard processing would be brought to researchers' attention for further analysis.

## Modeling the temporal dynamics of cervicovaginal microbiota identifies targets that may promote reproductive health.

Cervicovaginal bacterial communities composed of diverse anaerobes with low Lactobacillus abundance are associated with poor reproductive outcomes such as preterm birth, infertility, cervicitis, and risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Women in sub-Saharan Africa have a higher prevalence of these high-risk bacterial communities when compared to Western populations. However, the transition of cervicovaginal communities between high- and low-risk community states over time is not well described in African populations.

## The forgotten oral microbial transplantation for improving the outcomes of COVID-19.

Ever since the uncovering of the severe discrepancy of COVID-19 manifestations, irrespective of viral load, scientists have raced to locate and manage factors contributing to the genesis of a critical state. Recent evidence delineates the role of oral dysbiosis in the development of low-grade inflammation, characterized by the increase of inflammatory cytokines common to those fundamental to the development of severe COVID. Furthermore, high periodontopathic bacteria were recorded in severe acute respiratory syndrome in COVID patients as well as its common provoking comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. This can be explained by the immigration and elimination of oral bacteria into the airways, which, in the context of an injured lung, allows for their preferential overgrowth familiar to that causing the progression to advanced lung diseases. This is why we indicate the promising usage of oral microbiome transplantation as a treatment of the oral microbial dysbiosis, not only associated with worst outcomes of COVID-19 but also in other disorders of low-grade inflammation.
