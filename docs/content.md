The relevance of the human oral microbiome to our understanding of human health has grown in recent years as microbiome studies continue to develop. Given the links of the oral cavity with the digestive, respiratory and circulatory systems, the composition of the oral microbiome is relevant beyond just oral health, impacting systemic processes across the body. However, we still have a very limited understanding about intrinsic and extrinsic factors that shape the composition of the healthy oral microbiome. Here, we followed a citizen-science approach to assess the relative impact on the oral microbiome of selected biological, social, and lifestyle factors in 1648 Spanish individuals. We found that the oral microbiome changes across age, with middle ages showing a more homogeneous composition, and older ages showing more diverse microbiomes with increased representation of typically low abundance taxa. By measuring differences within and between groups of individuals sharing a given parameter, we were able to assess the relative impact of different factors in driving specific microbial compositions. Chronic health disorders present in the analyzed population were the most impactful factors, followed by smoking and the presence of yeasts in the oral cavity. Finally, we corroborate findings in the literature that relatives tend to have more similar oral microbiomes, and show for the first time a similar effect for classmates. Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors jointly shape the oral microbiome. Comparative analysis of metabarcoding data from a large sample set allows us to disentangle the individual effects.

## Host-Population Microbial Diversity Scaling of Chinese Gut Microbiomes in Gout Patients.

Gout is a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease that affects the life of tens of millions of people worldwide, and it typically presents as gout arthritis, gout stone, or even kidney damage. Research has revealed its connection with the gut microbiome, although exact mechanism is still unclear. Studies have shown the decline of microbiome diversity in gout patients and change of microbiome compositions between the gout patients and healthy controls. Nevertheless, how diversity changes across host individuals at a cohort (population) level has not been investigated to the best of our knowledge. Here we apply the diversity-area relationship (DAR), which is an extension to the classic SAR (species-area relationship) and establishes the power-function model between microbiome diversity and the number of individuals within cohort, to comparatively investigate diversity scaling (changes) of gut microbiome in gout patients and healthy controls. The DAR modeling with a study involving 83 subjects (41 gout patients) revealed that the potential number of microbial species in gout patients is only 70% of that in the healthy control (2790 vs 3900) although the difference may not be statistically significant. The other DAR parameters including diversity scaling and similarity parameters did not show statistically significant differences. We postulate that the high resilience of gut microbiome may explain the lack of significant gout-disease effects on gut microbial diversity at the population level. The lack of statistically significant difference between the gout patients and healthy controls at host population (cohort) level is different from the previous findings at individual level in the existing literature.

As the leading cause of cancer death, lung cancer seriously endangers human health and quality of life. Although many studies have reported the intestinal microbial composition of lung cancer, little is known about the interplay between intestinal microbiome and metabolites and how they affect the development of lung cancer. Herein, we combined 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology to analyze intestinal microbiota composition and serum metabolism profile in a cohort of 30 lung cancer patients with different stages and 15 healthy individuals. Compared with healthy people, we found that the structure of intestinal microbiota in lung cancer patients had changed significantly (Adonis, p = 0.021). In order to determine how intestinal flora affects the occurrence and development of lung cancer, the Spearman rank correlation test was used to find the connection between differential microorganisms and differential metabolites. It was found that as thez disease progressed, L-valine decreased. Correspondingly, the abundance of Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006, the genus with the strongest association with L-valine, also decreased in lung cancer groups. Correlation analysis showed that the gut microbiome and serum metabolic profile had a strong synergy, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 was closely related to L-valine. In summary, this study described the characteristics of intestinal flora and serum metabolic profiles of lung cancer patients with different stages. It revealed that lung cancer may be the result of the mutual regulation of L-valine and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 through the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway, and proposed that L-valine may be a potential marker for the diagnosis of lung cancer.
