## Effect of probiotics during vonoprazan-containing triple therapy on gut microbiota in Helicobacter pylori infection: A randomized controlled trial.

Probiotics are beneficial to patients with Helicobacter pylori infections by modulating the gut microbiota. Biofermin-R (BFR) is a multiple antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria preparation of Enterococcus faecium 129 BIO 3B-R and is effective in normalizing the gut microbiota when used in combination with antibiotics. This study aimed to determine the effect of BFR in combination with vonoprazan (VPZ)-based therapy on gut microbiota.

## Genome-resolved metagenomics to study co-occurrence patterns and intraspecific heterogeneity among plant pathogen metapopulations.
 24.03.2020, _E Newberry, R Bhandari, J Kemble, E Sikora, N Potnis_


Assessment of pathogen diversity in agricultural fields is essential for informing management decisions and the development of resistant plant varieties. However, many population genomic studies have relied on culture-based approaches that do not provide quantitative assessment of pathogen populations at the field-level or the associated host microbiome. Here, we applied whole-genome shotgun sequencing of microbial DNA extracted directly from the washings of pooled leaf samples, collected from individual tomato and pepper fields in Alabama that displayed the classical symptoms of bacterial spot disease caused by Xanthomonas spp. Our results revealed that while the occurrence of both X. perforans and X. euvesicatoria within fields was limited, evidence of co-occurrence of up to three distinct X. perforans genotypes was obtained in seven of the ten tomato fields sampled. These population dynamics were accompanied by the corresponding type 3 secreted effector repertoires associated with the co-occurring X. perforans genotypes, indicating that metapopulation structure within fields should be considered when assessing the adaptive potential of X. perforans. Finally, analysis of microbial community composition revealed that co-occurrence of the bacterial spot pathogens Pseudomonas cichorii and Xanthomonas spp. is common in Alabama fields and provided evidence for the non-random association of several other human- and plant-opportunists.

## Soil Microbial Diversity Affects the Plant-Root Colonization by Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi.
 22.03.2020, _DA Ferreira, TF da Silva, VS Pylro, JF Salles, FD Andreote, F Dini-Andreote_


Terrestrial plants establish symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to exchange water and nutrients. However, the extent to which soil biodiversity influences such association remains still unclear. Here, we manipulated the soil microbial diversity using a "dilution-to-extinction" approach in a controlled pot microcosm system and quantified the root length colonization of maize plants by the AMF Rhizophagus clarus. The experiment was performed by manipulating the soil microbiome within a native and foreign soil having distinct physicochemical properties. Overall, our data revealed significant positive correlations between the soil microbial diversity and AMF colonization. Most importantly, this finding opposes the diversity-invasibility hypothesis and highlights for a potential overall helper effect of the soil biodiversity on plant-AMF symbiosis.

## Joining Illumina paired-end reads for classifying phylogenetic marker sequences.
 20.03.2020, _T Liu, CY Chen, A Chen-Deng, YL Chen, JY Wang, YI Hou, MC Lin_


Illumina sequencing of a marker gene is popular in metagenomic studies. However, Illumina paired-end (PE) reads sometimes cannot be merged into single reads for subsequent analysis. When mergeable PE reads are limited, one can simply use only first reads for taxonomy annotation, but that wastes information in the second reads. Presumably, including second reads should improve taxonomy annotation. However, a rigorous investigation of how best to do this and how much can be gained has not been reported.

## M2IA: a Web Server for Microbiome and Metabolome Integrative Analysis.

Microbiome-metabolome association studies have experienced exponential growth for an in-depth understanding of the impact of microbiota on human health over the last decade. However, analyzing the resulting multi-omics data and their correlations remains a significant challenge due to the lack of a comprehensive computational tool that can facilitate data integration and interpretation. In this study, an automated microbiome and metabolome integrative analysis pipeline (M2IA) has been developed to meet the urgent needs for tools that can effectively integrate microbiome and metabolome data to derive biological insights.
