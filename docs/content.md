Childhood obesity not only has a negative impact on a child's health but is also a significant risk factor for adult obesity and related metabolic disorders, making it a major global public health concern. Recent studies have revealed the crucial role of gut microbiota in the occurrence and development of obesity, in addition to genetic and lifestyle factors. In this study, we recruited 19 normal-weight children and 47 children with varying degrees of obesity. A questionnaire survey was conducted to inquire about the family background, lifestyle habits and dietary composition of the 66 children. Findings indicate that fathers of obese children tend to be obese themselves, while children with highly educated mothers are more likely to maintain a normal weight. Furthermore, overweight children tend to spend more time on electronic devices and less time on physical activities compared to their normal-weight counterparts. Obese children exhibit significant differences in breakfast and dinner dietary composition when compared to children with normal weight. Additionally, the gut microbiota of these 66 children was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Analysis of gut microbiota composition showed similar compositions among children with varying degrees of obesity, but significant differences were observed in comparison to normal-weight children. Obese children exhibited a reduced proportion of Bacteroidota and an increased proportion of Firmicutes, resulting in an elevated Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratio. Moreover, Actinobacteriota were found to be increased in the gut microbiota of children with varying degrees of obesity. PICRUSt analysis indicated significant metabolic differences in the microbiota functions between obese and normal-weight children, suggesting the composition of gut microbiota could be a crucial factor contributing to obesity. These findings provide valuable insights for the treatment of childhood obesity.

## Microbial species pool-mediated diazotrophic community assembly in crop microbiomes during plant development.
 19.03.2024, _C Xiong, B K Singh, Y-G Zhu, H-W Hu, P-P Li, Y-L Han, L-L Han, Q-B Zhang, J-T Wang, S-Y Liu, C-F Wu, A-H Ge, L-M Zhang, J-Z He_


Plant-associated diazotrophs strongly relate to plant nitrogen (N) supply and growth. However, our knowledge of diazotrophic community assembly and microbial N metabolism in plant microbiomes is largely limited. Here we examined the assembly and temporal dynamics of diazotrophic communities across multiple compartments (soils, epiphytic and endophytic niches of root and leaf, and grain) of three cereal crops (maize, wheat, and barley) and identified the potential N-cycling pathways in phylloplane microbiomes. Our results demonstrated that the microbial species pool, influenced by site-specific environmental factors (e.g., edaphic factors), had a stronger effect than host selection (i.e., plant species and developmental stage) in shaping diazotrophic communities across the soil-plant continuum. Crop diazotrophic communities were dominated by a few taxa (~0.7% of diazotrophic phylotypes) which were mainly affiliated with Methylobacterium, Azospirillum, Bradyrhizobium, and Rhizobium. Furthermore, eight dominant taxa belonging to Azospirillum and Methylobacterium were identified as keystone diazotrophic taxa for three crops and were potentially associated with microbial network stability and crop yields. Metagenomic binning recovered 58 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the phylloplane, and the majority of them were identified as novel species (37 MAGs) and harbored genes potentially related to multiple N metabolism processes (e.g., nitrate reduction). Notably, for the first time, a high-quality MAG harboring genes involved in the complete denitrification process was recovered in the phylloplane and showed high identity to Pseudomonas mendocina. Overall, these findings significantly expand our understanding of ecological drivers of crop diazotrophs and provide new insights into the potential microbial N metabolism in the phyllosphere.IMPORTANCEPlants harbor diverse nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (i.e., diazotrophic communities) in both belowground and aboveground tissues, which play a vital role in plant nitrogen supply and growth promotion. Understanding the assembly and temporal dynamics of crop diazotrophic communities is a prerequisite for harnessing them to promote plant growth. In this study, we show that the site-specific microbial species pool largely shapes the structure of diazotrophic communities in the leaves and roots of three cereal crops. We further identify keystone diazotrophic taxa in crop microbiomes and characterize potential microbial N metabolism pathways in the phyllosphere, which provides essential information for developing microbiome-based tools in future sustainable agricultural production.

## Bacterial communities associated with an island radiation of lichen-forming fungi.
 21.03.2024, _M Blázquez, R Ortiz-Álvarez, F Gasulla, I Pérez-Vargas, S Pérez-Ortega_


_Lichens, Phylogeny, Bacteria, Fungi, Microbiota_
Evolutionary radiations are one of the most striking processes biologists have studied in islands. A radiation is often sparked by the appearance of ecological opportunity, which can originate in processes like trophic niche segregation or the evolution of key innovations. Another recently proposed mechanism is facilitation mediated by the bacterial communities associated with the radiating species. Here we explore the role of the bacterial communities in a radiation of lichen-forming fungi endemic to Macaronesia. Bacterial diversity was quantified by high throughput sequencing of the V1-V2 hyper-variable region of 172 specimens. We characterized the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial communities associated with the different species, tested for compositional differences between these communities, carried out a functional prediction, explored the relative importance of different factors in bacterial community structure, searched for phylosymbiosis and tried to identify the origin of this pattern. The species of the radiation differed in the composition of their bacterial communities, which were mostly comprised of Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteriia, but not in the functionality of those communities. A phylosimbiotic pattern was detected, but it was probably caused by environmental filtering. These findings are congruent with the combined effect of secondary chemistry and mycobiont identity being the main driver of bacterial community structure. Altogether, our results suggest that the associated bacterial communities are not the radiation's main driver. There is one possible exception, however, a species that has an abnormally diverse core microbiome and whose bacterial communities could be subject to a specific environmental filter at the functional level.

Water-borne plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes are a major threat in greenhouse production systems. Early detection and quantification of these pathogens would enable us to ascertain both economic and biological thresholds required for a timely treatment, thus improving effective disease management. Here, we used Oxford nanopore MinION amplicon sequencing to analyze microbial communities in irrigation water collected from greenhouses used for growing tomato, cucumber and Aeschynanthus sp. Fungal and oomycete communities were characterized using primers that amplify the full internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. To assess the sensitivity of the MinION sequencing, we spiked serially diluted mock DNA into the DNA isolated from greenhouse water samples prior to library preparation. Relative abundances of fungal and oomycete reads were distinct in the greenhouse irrigation water samples and in water samples from setups with tomato that was inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum. Sequence reads derived from fungal and oomycete mock communities were proportionate in the respective serial dilution samples, thus confirming the suitability of MinION amplicon sequencing for environmental monitoring. By using spike-ins as standards to test the reliability of quantification using the MinION, we found that the detection of spike-ins was highly affected by the background quantities of fungal or oomycete DNA in the sample. We observed that spike-ins having shorter length (538bp) produced reads across most of our dilutions compared to the longer spikes (&gt;790bp). Moreover, the sequence reads were uneven with respect to dilution series and were least retrievable in the background samples having the highest DNA concentration, suggesting a narrow dynamic range of performance. We suggest continuous benchmarking of the MinION sequencing to improve quantitative metabarcoding efforts for rapid plant disease diagnostic and monitoring in the future.

Health implications of indoor air quality (IAQ) have drawn more attention since the COVID epidemic. There are many different kinds of studies done on how IAQ affects people's well-being. There hasn't been much research that looks at the microbiological composition of the aerosol in subway transit systems. In this work, for the first time, we examined the aerosol bacterial abundance, diversity, and composition in the microbiome of the Seoul subway and train stations using DNA isolated from the PM10 samples from each station (three subway and two KTX stations). The average PM10 mass concentration collected on the respective platform was 41.862 µg/m3, with the highest average value of 45.95 µg/m3 and the lowest of 39.25 µg/m3. The bacterial microbiomes mainly constituted bacterial species of soil and environmental origin (e.g., Acinetobacter, Brevundimonas, Lysinibacillus, Clostridiodes) with fewer from human sources (Flaviflexus, Staphylococcus). This study highlights the relationship between microbiome diversity and PM10 mass concentration contributed by outdoor air and commuters in South Korea's subway and train stations. This study gives insights into the microbiome diversity, the source, and the susceptibility of public transports in disease spreading.

_Humans, Microbiota, Software, Regression Analysis, DNA_
A recent breakthrough in differential network (DN) analysis of microbiome data has been realized with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. The DN analysis disentangles the microbial co-abundance among taxa by comparing the network properties between two or more graphs under different biological conditions. However, the existing methods to the DN analysis for microbiome data do not adjust for other clinical differences between subjects.

Renal fibrosis is a typical pathological change from chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal failure, which presents significant challenges in prevention and treatment. The progression of renal fibrosis is closely associated with the "gut-kidney axis," therefore, although clinical intervention to modulate the "gut-kidney axis" imbalance associated with renal fibrosis brings hope for its treatment. In this study, we first identified the close relationship between renal fibrosis development and the intestinal microenvironment through fecal microtransplantation and non-absorbable antibiotics experiments. Then, we analyzed the specific connection between the intestinal microenvironment and renal fibrosis using microbiomics and metabolomics, screening for the differential intestinal metabolite. Potential metabolite action targets were initially identified through network simulation of molecular docking and further verified by molecular biology experiment. We used flow cytometry, TUNEL apoptosis staining, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting to assess renal injury and fibrosis extent, exploring the potential role of gut microbial metabolite in renal fibrosis development. We discovered that CKD-triggered alterations in the intestinal microenvironment exacerbate renal injury and fibrosis. When metabolomic analysis was combined with experiments in vivo, we found that the differential metabolite xylitol delays renal injury and fibrosis development. We further validated this hypothesis at the cellular level. Mechanically, bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) protein exhibits strong binding with xylitol, and xylitol alleviates renal fibrosis by inhibiting BRD4 and its downstream transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway. In summary, our findings suggest that the natural intestinal metabolite xylitol mitigates renal fibrosis by inhibiting the BRD4-regulated TGF-β pathway.
