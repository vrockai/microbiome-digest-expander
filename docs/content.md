## Dispersal strategies shape persistence and evolution of human gut bacteria.
 10.06.2021, _F Hildebrand, TI Gossmann, C Frioux, E Özkurt, PN Myers, P Ferretti, M Kuhn, M Bahram, HB Nielsen, P Bork_


Human gut bacterial strains can co-exist with their hosts for decades, but little is known about how these microbes persist and disperse, and evolve thereby. Here, we examined these processes in 5,278 adult and infant fecal metagenomes, longitudinally sampled in individuals and families. Our analyses revealed that a subset of gut species is extremely persistent in individuals, families, and geographic regions, represented often by locally successful strains of the phylum Bacteroidota. These "tenacious" bacteria show high levels of genetic adaptation to the human host but a high probability of loss upon antibiotic interventions. By contrast, heredipersistent bacteria, notably Firmicutes, often rely on dispersal strategies with weak phylogeographic patterns but strong family transmissions, likely related to sporulation. These analyses describe how different dispersal strategies can lead to the long-term persistence of human gut microbes with implications for gut flora modulations.

## Urinary Microbiome: Yin and Yang of the Urinary Tract.
 05.06.2021, _V Perez-Carrasco, A Soriano-Lerma, M Soriano, J Gutiérrez-Fernández, JA Garcia-Salcedo_


The application of next generation sequencing techniques has allowed the characterization of the urinary tract microbiome and has led to the rejection of the pre-established concept of sterility in the urinary bladder. Not only have microbial communities in the urinary tract been implicated in the maintenance of health but alterations in their composition have also been associated with different urinary pathologies, such as urinary tract infections (UTI). Therefore, the study of the urinary microbiome in healthy individuals, as well as its involvement in disease through the proliferation of opportunistic pathogens, could open a potential field of study, leading to new insights into prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies for urinary pathologies. In this review we present an overview of the current state of knowledge about the urinary microbiome in health and disease, as well as its involvement in the development of new therapeutic strategies.

## HAI-1 is an independent predictor of lung cancer mortality and is required for M1 macrophage polarization.
 29.06.2021, _S Borowicz, DR Principe, MJ Dorman, AJ McHenry, G Sondarva, S Kumar, V Ananthanarayanan, PE Simms, A Hess, A Rana_


Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Though immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized lung cancer therapy in recent years, there are several factors limiting the therapeutic efficacy of ICI-based immunotherapy in lung cancer. Recent evidence suggests that one such mechanism is the phenotypic shift of tumor-infiltrating macrophages away from an anti-tumor M1 phenotype and towards an anti-inflammatory and tumor-permissive M2 phenotype. Though this phenomenon is well documented, the means through which the lung tumor microenvironment (TME) usurps macrophage function are poorly described. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a known driver of both lung cancer pathobiology as well as M2 polarization, and its signaling is antagonized by the tumor suppressor gene HAI-1 (SPINT1). Using a combination of genomic databases, primary NSCLC specimens, and in vitro models, we determined that patients with loss of HAI-1 have a particularly poor prognosis, hallmarked by increased HGF expression and an M2-dominant immune infiltrate. Similarly, conditioned media from HAI-1-deficient tumor cells led to a loss of M1 and increased M2 polarization in vitro, and patient NSCLC tissues with loss of HAI-1 showed a similar loss of M1 macrophages. Combined, these results suggest that loss of HAI-1 is a potential means through which tumors acquire an immunosuppressive, M2-dominated TME, potentially through impaired M1 macrophage polarization. Hence, HAI-1 status may be informative when stratifying patients that may benefit from therapies targeting the HGF pathway, particularly as an adjuvant to ICI-based immunotherapy.
