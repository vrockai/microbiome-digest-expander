Accumulating evidence has focused on elucidating the bacterial component of the gut microbiota in patients with schizophrenia (SC); however, the fungal composition in the gut has not been investigated, although previous studies have suggested that gut mycobiota may be intricately linked to this disorder. The purpose of this analysis was to examine gut bacterial and fungi in first-episode, drug- naïve adult SC patients in relation to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC).

## [Gut microbiome, metabolites, and tissue metabolism in graft-versus-host disease].
 03.05.2022, _H Fujiwara_


_Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Graft vs Host Disease, Homeostasis, Humans, Microbiota_
Immune reactions promote not only graft-versus-tumor events but also graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) characterized by the activation of T-cells and antigen-presenting cells. Recent studies have unveiled the effects of microbial flora on GVHD and brought the mechanism other than immune cells. The role of tissue-intrinsic factors contributes to target-tissue resilience, repair, and regeneration and mitigates the severity of GVHD without altering alloreactive immune cells. Antibiotics, specific bacteria, and low microbiota diversity are identified as risk factors for GVHD and mortality. The current focus has shifted to target-tissue homeostasis in GVHD. Most of the gut microbiota symbiotically colonize the gut, and this homeostasis is finely tuned in the gastrointestinal tract, which has a relatively hypoxic environment dominated by anaerobic organisms. Therefore, intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are uniquely adapted to this hypoxic environment, and cells programmed by "physiological hypoxia" tonally regulate barrier function with commensal bacteria. Metabolic changes in IECs post allo-HCT can affect the gut environment, leading to dysbiosis. This review focuses on the role of metabolism in IECs with microbiota and microbial metabolites in the GVHD setting to promote tissue tolerance.

## Causality Verification for the Correlation between the Presence of Nonstarter Bacteria and Flavor Characteristics in Soft-Type Ripened Cheeses.
 10.11.2022, _R Unno, T Suzuki, Y Osaki, M Matsutani, M Ishikawa_


Flavor characteristics of ripened cheese are established by various bacteria, such as lactic acid bacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, which spontaneously develop during the cheese-manufacturing process. We previously revealed the relationship between bacterial microbiota and flavor components in soft-type ripened cheeses by using a multiomics approach that combined metagenomics and metabolomics; however, we could not establish a causal relationship. This study aimed to substantiate the causal nature of the correlations revealed by the multiomics approach by using cheese-ripening tests with single isolate inoculation. The bacterial diversity and composition in surface mold-ripened cheeses from Japan and France varied, depending on the differences between the milks (pasteurized or raw), cheese positions (core or rind), and manufacturers. Although the volatile compounds did not clearly reflect the distinctive characteristics of the cheese samples, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria positively correlated with ketones and sulfur compounds, as evidenced by a Spearman's correlation analysis. Cheese-ripening tests conducted after inoculation with single bacterial strains belonging to the above-mentioned taxa confirmed that these bacteria formed volatile compounds, in agreement with the correlations observed. In particular, various flavor compounds, such as acids, esters, ketones, and sulfur compounds, were detected in cheese inoculated with Pseudoalteromonas sp. TS-4-4 strain. These findings provide important insights into the role of nonstarter bacteria in the development of cheese flavor and into the effectiveness of the multiomics approach in screening for bacteria that can improve the quality of cheese products. IMPORTANCE Our previous study revealed that the existence of various bacteria, such as lactic acid bacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, clearly correlated with the abundance of flavor components, such as volatile compounds, in soft-type ripened cheeses via a multiomics approach that used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, this approach only showed correlations derived from statistical analyses rather than causal relationships. Therefore, in the present study, we performed cheese-ripening tests using nonstarter bacteria to substantiate the correlations revealed by the multiomics approach in soft-type ripened cheese. Our results suggest the capability of nonstarter bacteria, such as Proteobacteria, to impart flavor to cheese and the effectiveness of the multiomics approach in screening for microbial isolates that can improve the quality of cheese. Overall, our research provides new insights into the importance of bacteria in cheese production.

## High-Throughput Profiling of Root-Associated Microbial Communities.
 27.07.2022, _F Getzke, S Hacquard_

Roots of healthy plants are colonized by a great diversity of bacteria and fungi but also other microorganisms that are collectively referred to as the root microbiota. Root microbiota composition is shaped by environmental cues, by host genetics, but also by microbe-microbe interactions, and recent evidence indicates that a direct link exists between root microbiota assembly and host health. In order to characterize the root microbiota or to study the complex interplay between plants and their associated microbes, the assessment of microbial community structure via marker gene amplicon sequencing has become a key tool. Herein, we present detailed methods for the preparation of 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon libraries to characterize Arabidopsis thaliana-associated bacterial and fungal communities along the soil-root continuum. The protocols can be easily adapted for different host organs or plant species.

## Barley Resistance to Fusarium graminearum Infections: From Transcriptomics to Field with Food Safety Concerns.
 09.11.2022, _A Hameed, P Poznanski, M Noman, T Ahmed, A Iqbal, A Nadolska-Orczyk, W Orczyk_


Global climate change and the urgency to transform food crops require substantial breeding efforts to meet the food security challenges. Barley, an important cereal, has remained a preferential host of phytotoxic diseases caused by the Fusarium graminearum that not only severely reduces the crop yield but also compromises its food quality due to the accumulation of mycotoxins. To develop resistance against Fusarium infections, a better understanding of the host-pathogen interaction is inevitable and could be tracked through molecular insights. Here, we focused precisely on the potential gene targets that are exclusive to this devastating pathosystem and could be harnessed for fast breeding of barley. We also discuss the eco-friendly applications of nanobio hybrid and the CRISPR technology for barley protection. This review covers the critical information gaps within the subject and may be useful for the sustainable improvement of barley from the perspective of food and environmental safety concerns.
