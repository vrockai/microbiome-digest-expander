The human milk microbiota (HMM) is thought to influence the long-term health of offspring. However, its role in asthma and atopy and the impact of host genomics on HMM composition remain unclear. Through the CHILD Cohort Study, we followed 885 pregnant mothers and their offspring from birth to 5 years and determined that HMM was associated with maternal genomics and prevalence of childhood asthma and allergic sensitization (atopy) among human milk-fed infants. Network analysis identified modules of correlated microbes in human milk that were associated with subsequent asthma and atopy in preschool-aged children. Moreover, reduced alpha-diversity and increased Lawsonella abundance in HMM were associated with increased prevalence of childhood atopy. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified maternal genetic loci (e.g., ADAMTS8, NPR1, and COTL1) associated with HMM implicated with asthma and atopy, notably Lawsonella and alpha-diversity. Thus, our study elucidates the role of host genomics on the HMM and its potential impact on childhood asthma and atopy.

Composition of the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal, obstetric, and child health outcomes. Therefore, identifying sources of individual differences in the vaginal microbiome is of considerable clinical and public health interest. The current study tested the hypothesis that vaginal microbiome composition during pregnancy is associated with an individual's experience of affective symptoms and stress exposure.

Tumor is accompanied by complex and dynamic microenvironment development, and the interaction of all its components influences disease progression and response to treatment. Once the tumor microenvironment has been eradicated, various mechanisms can induce the tumors. Microorganisms can maintain the homeostasis of the tumor microenvironment through immune regulation, thereby inhibiting tumor development. Akkermania muciniphila (A. muciniphila), an anaerobic bacterium, can induce tumor immunity, regulate the gastrointestinal microenvironment through metabolites, outer membrane proteins, and some cytokines, and enhance the curative effect through combined immunization. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the complex interaction between A. muciniphila and human immunity will facilitate the development of immunotherapeutic strategies in the future and enable patients to obtain a more stable clinical response. This article reviews the most recent developments in the tumor immunity of A. muciniphila.

The underlying medical conditions and gut dysbiosis is known to influence COVID-19 severity in high-risk patients. The current review proposed the optimal usage of nutraceuticals &amp; pharmacological interventions can help regulate the protective immune response and balance the regulatory functionality of gut microbiota. Many studies have revealed that the probiotic interventions viz., Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. plantarum &amp; other bacterial spp. reduce IFNγ &amp; TNF-α and increase IL-4 &amp; IL-10 secretions to control the immunostimulatory effects in upper respiratory tract infection. Dietary fibres utilized by beneficial microbiota and microbial metabolites can control the NF-kB regulation. Vitamin C halts the propagation of pathogens and vitamin D and A modulate the GM. Selenium and Flavonoids also control the redox regulations. Interferon therapy can antagonize the viral replications, while corticosteroids may reduce the death rates. BCG vaccine reprograms the monocytes to build trained immunity. Bifidobacterium and related microbes were found to increase the vaccine efficacy. Vaccines against COVID-19 and season flu also boost the immunity profile for robust protection. Over all, the collective effects of these therapeutics could help increase the opportunities for faster recovery from infectious diseases.

## The role of intestinal microbiota in physiologic and body compositional changes that accompany CLA-mediated weight loss in obese mice.
 18.09.2024, _M Zhang, YS Yin, KS May, S Wang, H Purcell, XS Zhang, MJ Blaser, LJ den Hartigh_


Obesity continues to be a major problem, despite known treatment strategies such as lifestyle modifications, pharmaceuticals, and surgical options, necessitating the development of novel weight loss approaches. The naturally occurring fatty acid, 10,12 conjugated linoleic acid (10,12 CLA), promotes weight loss by increasing fat oxidation and browning of white adipose tissue, leading to increased energy expenditure in obese mice. Coincident with weight loss, 10,12 CLA also alters the murine gut microbiota by enriching for microbes that produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), with concurrent elevations in fecal butyrate and plasma acetate.

## Depletion of the paternal gut microbiome alters sperm small RNAs and impacts offspring physiology and behavior in mice.

The paternal environment prior to conception has been demonstrated to influence offspring physiology and behavior, with the sperm epigenome (including noncoding RNAs) proposed as a potential facilitator of non-genetic inheritance. Whilst the maternal gut microbiome has been established as an important influence on offspring development, the impact of the paternal gut microbiota on offspring development, health and behavior is largely unknown. Gut microbiota have major influences on immunity, and thus we hypothesized that it may be relevant to paternal immune activation modulating epigenetic inheritance in mice. Therefore, male C57BL/6J mice (F0) were orally administered non-absorbable antibiotics via drinking water in order to substantially deplete their gut microbiota. Four weeks after administration of the antibiotics (gut microbiome depletion), F0 male mice were then mated with naïve female mice. The F1 offspring of the microbiome-depleted males had reduced body weight as well as altered gut morphology (shortened colon length). F1 females showed significant alterations in affective behaviors, including measures of anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, indicating altered development. Analysis of small noncoding RNAs in the sperm of F0 mice revealed that gut microbiome depletion is associated with differential expression of 8 different PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), each of which has the potential to modulate the expression of multiple downstream gene targets, and thus influence epigenetic inheritance and offspring development. This study demonstrates that the gut-germline axis influences sperm small RNA profiles, offspring physiology, with specific impacts on offspring affective and/or coping behaviors. These findings may have broader implications for other animal species with comparable gut microbiota, intergenerational epigenetics and developmental biology, including humans.

The microbiota and metabolites in the gastrointestinal tracts of female animals at different reproductive periods are very important to the growth, development, and health of themselves and their offspring. However, the changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota and metabolites throughout reproductive period of different sheep breeds and their effects on the growth and development of offspring lambs are still unclear. Hence, this study presents an assessment of the reproductive hormone levels, immune levels, rumen microbiota, and metabolites in Hu sheep and Suffolk ewes at different reproductive periods and their effects on the growth and development of offspring lambs.

Plants have evolved various defense mechanisms against insect herbivores, including the formation of physical barriers, the synthesis of toxic metabolites, and the activation of phytohormone responses. Although plant-associated microbiota influence plant growth and health, whether they play a role in plant defense against insect pests in natural ecosystems is unknown.

## Birth of protein folds and functions in the virome.

The rapid evolution of viruses generates proteins that are essential for infectivity and replication but with unknown functions, due to extreme sequence divergence1. Here, using a database of 67,715 newly predicted protein structures from 4,463 eukaryotic viral species, we found that 62% of viral proteins are structurally distinct and lack homologues in the AlphaFold database2,3. Among the remaining 38% of viral proteins, many have non-viral structural analogues that revealed surprising similarities between human pathogens and their eukaryotic hosts. Structural comparisons suggested putative functions for up to 25% of unannotated viral proteins, including those with roles in the evasion of innate immunity. In particular, RNA ligase T-like phosphodiesterases were found to resemble phage-encoded proteins that hydrolyse the host immune-activating cyclic dinucleotides 3',3'- and 2',3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Experimental analysis showed that RNA ligase T homologues encoded by avian poxviruses similarly hydrolyse cGAMP, showing that RNA ligase T-mediated targeting of cGAMP is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of immune evasion that is present in both bacteriophage and eukaryotic viruses. Together, the viral protein structural database and analyses presented here afford new opportunities to identify mechanisms of virus-host interactions that are common across the virome.
