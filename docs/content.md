## Altered intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolites in patients with latent and active pulmonary tuberculosis.
 16.11.2024, _H Zhang, M Xue, X He, L Sun, Q He, Y Wang, J Jin_


Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is the main cause of infection-related mortality and the most common infectious disease that develops resistance to antibiotics. Gut microbiota and their associated metabolites are assumed to induce and influence the development of PTB. However, the alterations of gut microbiota and metabolites in TB patients is currently unclear.

The early microbiota of neonates is crucial for developing the postnatal immune system and establishing normal physiological, metabolic, and neurological functions. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing the diversity of the neonatal oral microbiome, including mother-to-newborn microbial transmission. The study includes a prospective cohort comprising 73 mothers and 87 neonates and a retrospective cohort comprising 991 mothers and 1,121 neonates. Samples from the maternal cervix and neonatal gastric, bronchial, and oral cavities were analyzed using culture-based methods. Neonatal oral swab samples were also analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize microbial diversity and composition. Similar genera were detected in the neonatal gastric, bronchial, and oral samples, and the neonatal gastric culture was the most similar to the maternal cervical culture. In addition to mother-to-newborn microbial transmission, various natal factors including birth type, birth weight, delivery mode, maternal chorioamnionitis, maternal diabetes and the presence of microbes in other sites influenced neonatal oral microbiome diversity. Among these factors, the birth type was the most significant, and preterm neonates exhibited decreased oral microbiome diversity, with fewer beneficial bacteria and more pathogens. These findings could serve as a baseline for research on the establishment of the oral microbiota in preterm neonates and its health implications.

Microbial interactions mediating colonization resistance play key roles within the human microbiome, shaping susceptibility to infection from birth. To gain insight into microbiome-mediated defenses and respiratory pathogen colonization dynamics, we sequenced and analyzed nasal (n=229) and oral (n=210) microbiomes with associated health/environmental data from our Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort at age 24-months. Participants with early-life lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were more likely to be formula-fed, attend daycare, and experience wheezing. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing with detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens revealed nasal microbiome composition to associate with prior LRTI - namely lower alpha diversity, depletion of Prevotella, and enrichment of Moraxella catarrhalis including drug-resistant strains. Prevotella originating from healthy microbiomes had higher biosynthetic gene cluster abundance and exhibited contact-independent inhibition of M. catarrhalis, suggesting interbacterial competition impacts nasal pathogen colonization. This work advances understanding of protective host-microbial interactions occurring in airway microbiomes that alter infection susceptibility in early-life.

## Microbiota-induced alteration of kynurenine metabolism in macrophages drives formation of creeping fat in Crohn's disease.

Hyperplasia of mesenteric tissues in Crohn's disease, called creeping fat (CrF), is associated with surgical recurrence. Although microbiota translocation and colonization have been found in CrF, convincing mouse phenotypes and the underlying mechanisms of CrF formation remain unclear. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA (snRNA) sequencing of CrF and different mouse models, we demonstrate that the commensal Achromobacter pulmonis induces mesenteric adipogenesis through macrophage alteration. Targeted metabolome analysis reveals that L-kynurenine is the most enriched metabolite in CrF. Upregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) enhances kynurenine metabolism and drives mesenteric adipogenesis. Leveraging single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing of mouse mesenteric tissues and macrophage-specific IDO1 knockout mice, we verify the role of macrophage-sourced L-kynurenine in mesenteric adipogenesis. Mechanistically, L-kynurenine-induced adipogenesis is mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptors in adipocytes. Administration of an IDO1 inhibitor or bacteria engineered to degrade L-kynurenine alleviates mesenteric adipogenesis in mice. Collectively, our study demonstrates that microbiota-induced modulation of macrophage metabolism potentiates CrF formation.

## Estimates of microbiome heritability across hosts.
 15.11.2024, _AH Morris, BJM Bohannan_


Microbiomes contribute to variation in many plant and animal traits, suggesting that microbiome-mediated traits could evolve through selection on the host. However, for such evolution to occur, microbiomes must exhibit sufficient heritability to contribute to host adaptation. Previous work has attempted to estimate the heritability of a variety of microbiome attributes. Here we show that most published estimates are limited to vertebrate and plant hosts, but significant heritability of microbiome attributes has been frequently reported. This indicates that microbiomes could evolve in response to host-level selection, but studies across a wider range of hosts are necessary before general conclusions can be made. We suggest future studies focus on standardizing heritability measurements for the purpose of meta-analyses and investigate the role of the environment in contributing to heritable microbiome variation. This could have important implications for the use of microbiomes in conservation, agriculture and medicine.

_Humans, Dietary Supplements, European Union, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Prebiotics_
Numerous studies have established that prebiotic ingredients in foods and dietary supplements may play a role in supporting human health. Over the three decades that have passed since prebiotics were first defined as a concept, research has revealed a complex universe of prebiotic-induced changes to the human microbiota. There are strong indications of a direct link between these prebiotic-induced changes and specific health benefits. However, at the present time, the EU has not permitted use of the term 'prebiotic' in connection with an approved health claim. This paper is the outcome of a workshop organized on the 25th October 2023 by the European branch of the International Life Science Institute (ILSI). It provides an overview of the regulatory requirements for authorized health claims in the EU, key areas of prebiotic research, and findings to date in relation to prebiotics and digestive, immune, metabolic and cognitive health. Research gaps and documentation challenges are then explored and a roadmap proposed for achieving authorization of 'prebiotic' in the wording of future EU health claims.

## The Microbiome Modifies Manifestations of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis in Perforin-Deficient Mice.
 16.11.2024, _J Mann, S Runge, C Schell, K Gräwe, G Thoulass, J Lao, S Ammann, S Grün, C König, SA Berger, B Hild, P Aichele, SP Rosshart, S Ehl_


Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome caused by inborn errors of cytotoxicity. Patients with biallelic PRF1 null mutations (encoding perforin) usually develop excessive immune cell activation, hypercytokinemia, and life-threatening immunopathology in the first 6 months of life, often without an apparent infectious trigger. In contrast, perforin-deficient (PKO) mice only develop HLH after systemic infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We hypothesized that restricted microbe-immune cell interactions due to specific pathogen-free (SPF) housing might explain the need for this specific viral trigger in PKO mice. To investigate the influence of a "wild" microbiome in PKO mice, we fostered PKO newborns with Wildling microbiota ('PKO-Wildlings') and monitored them for signs of HLH. PKO-Wildlings survived long-term without spontaneous disease. Also, systemic infection with vaccinia virus did not reach the threshold of immune activation required to trigger HLH in PKO-Wildlings. Interestingly, after infection with LCMV, PKO-Wildlings developed an altered HLH pattern. This included lower IFN-γ serum levels along with improved IFN-γ-driven anemia, but more elevated levels of IL-17 and increased liver inflammation compared with PKO-SPF mice. Thus, wild microbiota alone is not sufficient to trigger HLH in PKO mice, but host-microbe interactions shape inflammatory cytokine patterns, thereby influencing manifestations of HLH immunopathology.

## Spatiotemporal dynamics during niche remodeling by super-colonizing microbiota in the mammalian gut.

While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be effective in reversing gut dysbiosis, we lack an understanding of the fundamental processes underlying microbial engraftment in the mammalian gut. Here, we explored a murine gut colonization model leveraging natural inter-individual variations in gut microbiomes to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of FMT. We identified a natural "super-donor" consortium that robustly engrafts into diverse recipients and resists reciprocal colonization. Temporal profiling of the gut microbiome showed an ordered succession of rapid engraftment by early colonizers within 72 h, followed by a slower emergence of late colonizers over 15-30 days. Moreover, engraftment was localized to distinct compartments of the gastrointestinal tract in a species-specific manner. Spatial metagenomic characterization suggested engraftment was mediated by simultaneous transfer of spatially co-localizing species from the super-donor consortia. These results offer a mechanism of super-donor colonization by which nutritional niches are expanded in a spatiotemporally dependent manner. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

_Cannabis, Seeds, Endophytes, Genotype, Bacteria, Domestication, Microbiota, Symbiosis_
Beyond carrying the plant embryo, seeds harbour intricate microbial communities whose transmission across successive plant generations can significantly influence the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant-microbe symbioses. The process of plant domestication has potential repercussions in genes involved in plant-microbiome interactions. However, the extent to which breeding can impact the seed microbiome is sparsely explored. Cannabis is a high-value crop but sparsely subjected to agricultural innovations established in other crop species during the last century. Here, we conduct a large-scale analysis of the bacterial seed microbiome of Cannabis across different domestication grades and investigate the potential of seed-associated endophytes as plant growth-promoting agents under both controlled and field conditions.
