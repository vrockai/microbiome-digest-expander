## Oceanic Hitchhikers - Assessing Pathogen Risks from Marine Microplastic.
 17.08.2020, _J Bowley, C Baker-Austin, A Porter, R Hartnell, C Lewis_


As plastic debris in the environment continues to increase, an emerging concern is the potential for microplastic to act as vectors for pathogen transport. With aquaculture the fastest growing food sector, and microplastic contamination of shellfish increasingly demonstrated, understanding any risk of pathogen transport associated with microplastic is important for this industry. However, there remains a lack of detailed, systematic studies assessing the interactions and potential impacts that the attachment of human and animal pathogens on microplastic may have. Here we synthesise current knowledge regarding these distinct microplastic-associated bacterial communities and microplastic uptake pathways into bivalves, and discuss whether they represent a human and animal health threat, highlighting the outstanding questions critical to our understanding of this potential risk to food safety.

## Analysis of the Composition and Functions of the Microbiome in Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis based on 16S rRNA and Metagenome Sequencing Technology.

Metagenome sequencing has not been used in infected bone specimens. This study aimed to analyze the microbiome and its functions. This prospective observational study explored the microbiome and its functions of DFO (group DM) and posttraumatic foot osteomyelitis (PFO) (group NDM) based on 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenome sequencing technologies. Spearman analysis was used to explore the correlation between dominant species and clinical indicators of patients with DFO. High-throughput sequencing showed that all the specimens were polymicrobial. The microbial diversity was significantly higher in DM than in NDM. Firmicutes, Prevotellaceae, and Prevotella were the most abundant microbes in DM. The most abundant microbes in NDM were Proteobacteria, Halomonadaceae, and HalomonasPrevotella denticola, Prevotella jejuni and Prevotella fusca had positive correlation with the duration of diabetic foot infection (DFI_d). Proteus vulgaris was positively correlated with the infection index, while Bacteroides fragilis was negatively correlated. The microbial functional genes were more abundant in DM than in NDM. Metagenome sequencing is feasible for the analysis of the microbiome in infected bone specimens. G- bacteria and anaerobes are dominant in DFO.
