Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a subclinical syndrome of altered small intestinal function postulated to be an important contributor to childhood undernutrition. The role of small intestinal bacterial communities in the pathophysiology of EED is poorly defined due to a paucity of studies where there has been a direct collection of small intestinal samples from undernourished children. Sixty-three members of a Pakistani cohort identified as being acutely malnourished between 3 and 6 months of age and whose wasting (weight-for-length Z-score [WLZ]) failed to improve after a 2-month nutritional intervention underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Paired duodenal luminal aspirates and duodenal mucosal biopsies were obtained from 43 children. Duodenal microbiota composition was characterized by sequencing bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Levels of bacterial taxa (amplicon sequence variants [ASVs]) were referenced to anthropometric indices, histopathologic severity in biopsies, expression of selected genes in the duodenal mucosa, and fecal levels of an immunoinflammatory biomarker (lipocalin-2). A "core" group of eight bacterial ASVs was present in the duodenal samples of 69% of participants. Streptococcus anginosus was the most prevalent, followed by Streptococcus sp., Gemella haemolysans, Streptococcus australis, Granulicatella elegans, Granulicatella adiacens, and Abiotrophia defectiva. At the time of EGD, none of the core taxa were significantly correlated with WLZ. Statistically significant correlations were documented between the abundances of Granulicatella elegans and Granulicatella adiacens and the expression of duodenal mucosal genes involved in immune responses (dual oxidase maturation factor 2, serum amyloid A, and granzyme H). These results suggest that a potential role for members of the oral microbiota in pathogenesis, notably Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella species, warrants further investigation.IMPORTANCEUndernutrition among women and children is a pressing global health problem. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a disease of the small intestine (SI) associated with impaired gut mucosal barrier function and reduced capacity for nutrient absorption. The cause of EED is ill-defined. One emerging hypothesis is that alterations in the SI microbiota contribute to EED. We performed a culture-independent analysis of the SI microbiota of a cohort of Pakistani children with undernutrition who had failed a standard nutritional intervention, underwent upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, and had histologic evidence of EED in their duodenal mucosal biopsies. The results revealed a shared group of bacterial taxa in their duodenums whose absolute abundances were correlated with levels of the expression of genes in the duodenal mucosa that are involved in inflammatory responses. A number of these bacterial taxa are more typically found in the oral microbiota, a finding that has potential physiologic and therapeutic implications.

Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is an important precursor of heart failure (HF), but little is known about its relationship with gut dysbiosis and microbial-related metabolites. By leveraging the multi-omics data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), a study with population at high burden of LVDD, we aimed to characterize gut microbiota associated with LVDD and identify metabolite signatures of gut dysbiosis and incident LVDD.

## Impact of the gut microbiome composition on social decision-making.
 15.05.2024, _M Falkenstein, MC Simon, A Mantri, B Weber, L Koban, H Plassmann_


There is increasing evidence for the role of the gut microbiome in the regulation of socio-affective behavior in animals and clinical conditions. However, whether and how the composition of the gut microbiome may influence social decision-making in health remains unknown. Here, we tested the causal effects of a 7-week synbiotic (vs. placebo) dietary intervention on altruistic social punishment behavior in an ultimatum game. Results showed that the intervention increased participants' willingness to forgo a monetary payoff when treated unfairly. This change in social decision-making was related to changes in fasting-state serum levels of the dopamine-precursor tyrosine proposing a potential mechanistic link along the gut-microbiota-brain-behavior axis. These results improve our understanding of the bidirectional role body-brain interactions play in social decision-making and why humans at times act "irrationally" according to standard economic theory.

## The neonatal gut microbiome and global health.

_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Infant, Newborn, Global Health, Enterocolitis, Necrotizing, Infant, Synbiotics, Neonatal Sepsis_
The role of gut microbiome in health, a century-old concept, has been on the center stage of medical research recently. While different body sites, disease conditions, and populations have been targeted, neonatal and early infancy appear to be the most suitable period for such interventions. It is intriguing to note that, unlike traditional use in diarrhea and maintenance of gastrointestinal health, microbiome-mediating therapies have now addressed the most serious medical conditions in young infants such as necrotizing enterocolitis and neonatal sepsis. Unfortunately, almost all new endeavors in this space have been carried out in the Western world leaving behind millions of neonates that can benefit from such manipulations while serving as a large resource for further learning. In this review, an attempt has been made to quantify the global burden of neonatal morbidity and mortality, examples presented on interventions that have failed as a result of drawing from studies conducted in the West, and a case made for manipulating the neonatal gut microbiome to address the biggest killers in early life. A brief comparative analysis has been made to demonstrate the differences in the gut microbiota of North and South and a large clinical trial of synbiotics conducted by our group in a South Asian setting has been presented. Although challenging, the value of conducting such global health research is introduced with an intent to invite medical scientists to engage in well-planned, scientifically robust research endeavors. This can bring about innovation while saving and serving the most vulnerable citizens now and protecting them from the negative health consequences in the later part of their lives, ultimately shaping a resilient and equitable world as pledged by 193 United Nations member countries in 2015.

Parasitic helminths influence the composition of the gut microbiome. However, the microbiomes of individuals living in helminth-endemic regions are understudied. The Orang Asli, an indigenous population in Malaysia with high burdens of the helminth Trichuris trichiura, display microbiotas enriched in Clostridiales, an order of spore-forming obligate anaerobes with immunogenic properties. We previously isolated novel Clostridiales that were enriched in these individuals and found that a subset promoted the Trichuris life cycle. In this study, we aimed to further characterize the functional properties of these bacteria.

## 16S rRNA female reproductive microbiome investigation reveals Dalfopristin, Clorgyline, and Hydrazine as potential therapeutics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
 14.05.2024, _S Kulshrestha, R Redhu, R Dua, R Gupta, P Gupta, S Gupta, P Narad, A Sengupta_


Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a prevalent vaginal illness resulting from a disruption in the vaginal microbial equilibrium. The vaginal microbiota has been shown to have a substantial impact on the development and continuation of BV. This work utilized 16S rRNA sequence analysis of vaginal microbiome samples (Control vs BV samples) utilizing Parallel-Meta 3 to investigate the variations in microbial composition. The unique genes identified were used to determine prospective therapeutic targets and their corresponding inhibitory ligands. Further, molecular docking was conducted and then MD simulations were carried out to confirm the docking outcomes. In the BV samples, we detected several anaerobic bacteria recognized for their ability to generate biofilms, namely Acetohalobium, Anaerolineaceae, Desulfobacteraceae, and others. Furthermore, we identified Dalfopristin, Clorgyline, and Hydrazine as potential therapeutic options for the management of BV. This research provides new insights into the causes of BV and shows the potential effectiveness of novel pharmacological treatments.

Exposing C-section infants to the maternal vaginal microbiome, coined "vaginal seeding", partially restores microbial colonization. However, whether vaginal seeding decreases metabolic disease risk is unknown. Therefore, we assessed the effect of vaginal seeding of human infants on adiposity in a murine model. Germ-free mice were colonized with transitional stool from human infants who received vaginal seeding or control (placebo) seeding in a double-blind randomized trial. There was a reduction in intraabdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) volume in male mice that received stool from vaginally seeded infants compared to control infants. Higher levels of isoleucine and lower levels of nucleic acid metabolites were observed in controls and correlated with increased IAAT. This suggests that early changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome caused by vaginal seeding have a positive impact on metabolic health.

The rumen microbiome enables ruminants to digest otherwise indigestible feedstuffs, thereby facilitating the production of high-quality protein, albeit with suboptimal efficiency and producing methane. Despite extensive research delineating associations between the rumen microbiome and ruminant production traits, the functional roles of the pervasive and diverse rumen virome remain to be determined.

## Quantitative microbiome profiling of honey bee (Apis mellifera) guts is predictive of winter colony loss in northern Virginia (USA).
 14.05.2024, _DB Carlini, SK Winslow, K Cloppenborg-Schmidt, JF Baines_


_Animals, Bees, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Seasons, Virginia, Bacteria_
For the past 15 years, the proportion of honey bee hives that fail to survive winter has averaged ~ 30% in the United States. Winter hive loss has significant negative impacts on agriculture, the economy, and ecosystems. Compared to other factors, the role of honey bee gut microbial communities in driving winter hive loss has received little attention. We investigate the relationship between winter survival and honey bee gut microbiome composition of 168 honey bees from 23 hives, nine of which failed to survive through winter 2022. We found that there was a substantial difference in the abundance and community composition of honey bee gut microbiomes based on hive condition, i.e., winter survival or failure. The overall microbial abundance, as assessed using Quantitative Microbiome Profiling (QMP), was significantly greater in hives that survived winter 2022 than in those that failed, and the average overall abundance of each of ten bacterial genera was also greater in surviving hives. There were no significant differences in alpha diversity based on hive condition, but there was a highly significant difference in beta diversity. The bacterial genera Commensalibacter and Snodgrassella were positively associated with winter hive survival. Logistic regression and random forest machine learning models on pooled ASV counts for the genus data were highly predictive of winter outcome, although model performance decreased when samples from the location with no hive failures were excluded from analysis. As a whole, our results show that the abundance and community composition of honey bee gut microbiota is associated with winter hive loss, and can potentially be used as a diagnostic tool in evaluating hive health prior to the onset of winter. Future work on the functional characterization of the honey bee gut microbiome's role in winter survival is warranted.

## How do phytophagous insects affect phyllosphere fungi? Tracking fungi from milkweed to monarch caterpillar frass reveals communities dominated by fungal yeast.

Since a significant proportion of plant matter is consumed by herbivores, a necessary adaptation for many phyllosphere microbes could be to survive through the guts of herbivores. While many studies explore the gut microbiome of herbivores by surveying the microbiome in their frass, few studies compare the phyllosphere microbiome to the gut microbiome of herbivores. High-throughput metabarcode sequencing was used to track the fungal community from milkweed (Asclepias spp.) leaves to monarch caterpillar frass. The most commonly identified fungal taxa that dominated the caterpillar frass after the consumption of leaves were yeasts, mostly belonging to the Basidiomycota phylum. While most fungal communities underwent significant bottlenecks and some yeast taxa increased in relative abundance, a consistent directional change in community structure was not identified from leaf to caterpillar frass. These results suggest that some phyllosphere fungi, especially diverse yeasts, can survive herbivory, but whether herbivory is a key stage of their life cycle remains uncertain. For exploring phyllosphere fungi and the potential coprophilous lifestyles of endophytic and epiphytic fungi, methods that target yeast and Basidiomycota fungi are recommended.

## The gut lactic acid bacteria metabolite, 10-oxo-cis-6,trans-11-octadecadienoic acid, suppresses inflammatory bowel disease in mice by modulating the NRF2 pathway and GPCR-signaling.

Various gut bacteria, including Lactobacillus plantarum, possess several enzymes that produce hydroxy fatty acids (FAs), oxo FAs, conjugated FAs, and partially saturated FAs from polyunsaturated FAs as secondary metabolites. Among these derivatives, we identified 10-oxo-cis-6,trans-11-octadecadienoic acid (γKetoC), a γ-linolenic acid (GLA)-derived enon FA, as the most effective immunomodulator, which inhibited the antigen-induced immunoactivation and LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines. The treatment with γKetoC significantly suppressed proliferation of CD4+ T cells, LPS-induced activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), and LPS-induced IL-6 release from peritoneal cells, splenocytes, and CD11c+ cells isolated from the spleen. γKetoC also inhibited the release of inflammatory cytokines from BMDCs stimulated with poly-I:C, R-848, or CpG. Further in vitro experiments using an agonist of GPR40/120 suggested the involvement of these GPCRs in the effects of γKetoC on DCs. We also found that γKetoC stimulated the NRF2 pathway in DCs, and the suppressive effects of γKetoC and agonist of GPR40/120 on the release of IL-6 and IL-12 were reduced in Nrf2-/- BMDCs. We evaluated the role of NRF2 in the anti-inflammatory effects of γKetoC in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model. The oral administration of γKetoC significantly reduced body weight loss, improved stool scores, and attenuated atrophy of the colon, in wild-type C57BL/6 and Nrf2+/- mice with colitis. In contrast, the pathology of colitis was deteriorated in Nrf2-/- mice even with the administration of γKetoC. Collectively, the present results demonstrated the involvement of the NRF2 pathway and GPCRs in γKetoC-mediated anti-inflammatory responses.

The relationship between gut microbiota and obesity has recently been an important subject for research as the gut microbiota is thought to affect body homeostasis including body weight and composition, intervening with pro and prebiotics is an intelligent possible way for obesity management. To evaluate the effect of hypo caloric adequate fiber regimen with probiotic supplementation and physical exercise, whether it will have a good impact on health, body composition, and physique among obese Egyptian women or has no significant effect. The enrolled 58 women, in this longitudinal follow-up intervention study; followed a weight loss eating regimen (prebiotic), including a low-carbohydrate adequate-fiber adequate-protein dietary pattern with decreased energy intake. They additionally received daily probiotic supplements in the form of yogurt and were instructed to exercise regularly for 3 months. Anthropometric measurements, body composition, laboratory investigations, and microbiota analysis were obtained before and after the 3 months weight loss program. Statistically highly significant differences in the anthropometry, body composition parameters: and obesity-related biomarkers (Leptin, ALT, and AST) between the pre and post-follow-up measurements at the end of the study as they were all decreased. The prebiotic and probiotic supplementation induced statistically highly significant alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota with increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes and decreased relative abundance of Firmicutes and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes Ratio. Hypo caloric adequate fiber regimen diet with probiotics positively impacts body composition and is effective for weight loss normalizing serum Leptin and AST.

## Competition mode and soil nutrient status shape the role of soil microbes in the diversity-invasibility relationship.
 15.05.2024, _H Li, X Hu, X Geng, B Xiao, W Miao, Z Xu, Y Deng, B Jiang, Y Hou_


Understanding the relationship between plant diversity and invasibility is essential in invasion ecology. Species-rich communities are hypothesized to be more resistant to invasions than species-poor communities. However, while soil microorganisms play a crucial role in regulating this diversity-invasibility relationship, the effects of plant competition mode and soil nutrient status on their role remain unclear. To address this, we conducted a two-stage greenhouse experiment. Soils were first conditioned by growing nine native species separately in them for 1 year, then mixed in various configurations with soils conditioned using one, three, or six species, respectively. Next, we inoculated the mixed soil into sterilized substrate soil and planted the alien species Rhus typhina and native species Ailanthus altissima as test plants. We set up two competition modes (intraspecific and interspecific) and two nutrient levels (fertilization using slow-release fertilizer and nonfertilization). Under intraspecific competition, regardless of fertilization, the biomass of the alien species was higher in soil conditioned by six native species. By contrast, under interspecific competition, the biomass increased without fertilization but remained stable with fertilization in soil conditioned by six native species. Analysis of soil microbes suggests that pathogens and symbiotic fungi in diverse plant communities influenced R. typhina growth, which varied with competition mode and nutrient status. Our findings suggest that the soil microbiome is pivotal in mediating the diversity-invasibility relationship, and this influence varies according to competition mode and nutrient status.

## Quorum sensing related activities of beneficial and pathogenic bacteria have important implications for plant and human health.
 14.05.2024, _A Hartmann, T Binder, M Rothballer_


Eukaryotic organisms co-evolved with microbes from the environment forming holobiotic meta-genomic units. Members of host-associated microbiomes have commensalic, benefical / symbiotic or pathogenic phenotypes. More than 100 years ago, Lorenz Hiltner, pioneer of soil microbiology, introduced the term "Rhizosphere" to characterize the observation that a high density of saprophytic, beneficial and pathogenic microbes are attracted by root exudates. The balance between these types of microbes decide about the health of the host. Nowadays we know, that for the interaction of microbes with all eukaryotic hosts similar principles and processes of cooperative and competitive functions are in action. Small diffusible molecules like (phyto)hormones, volatiles and quorum sensing signals are examples for mediators of interspecies and cross-kingdom interactions. Quorum sensing (QS) of bacteria is mediated by different auto-inducible metabolites in a density dependent manner. In this perspective publication, the role of QS-related activities for the health of hosts will be discussed focussing mostly on N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL). It is also considered that in some cases very close phylogenetic relations exist between plant beneficial and opportunistic human pathogenic bacteria. Based on a genome and system-targeted new understanding, sociomicrobiological solutions are possible for the biocontrol of diseases and the health improvement of eukaryotic hosts.

## Impacts of vegetable processing and cheese making effluent on soil microbial functional diversity, community structure, and denitrification potential of land treatment systems.
 13.05.2024, _GS Siemering, FJ Arriaga, GA Cagle, JM Van Beek, ZB Freedman_


_Denitrification, Soil Microbiology, Cheese, Vegetables, Bacteria, Wastewater, Waste Disposal, Fluid, Soil_
The cheese making and vegetable processing industries generate immense volumes of high-nitrogen wastewater that is often treated at rural facilities using land applications. Laboratory incubation results showed denitrification decreased with temperature in industry facility soils but remained high in soils from agricultural sites (75% at 2.1°C). 16S rRNA, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and soil respiration analyses were conducted to investigate potential soil microbiome impacts. Biotic and abiotic system factor correlations showed no clear patterns explaining the divergent denitrification rates. In all three soil types at the phylum level, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria dominated, whereas at the class level, Nitrososphaeria and Alphaproteobacteria dominated, similar to denitrifying systems such as wetlands, wastewater resource recovery facilities, and wastewater-irrigated agricultural systems. Results show that potential denitrification drivers vary but lay the foundation to develop a better understanding of the key factors regulating denitrification in land application systems and protect local groundwater supplies. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Incubation study denitrification rates decreased as temperatures decreased, potentially leading to groundwater contamination issues during colder months. The three most dominant phyla for all systems are Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria. The dominant class for all systems is Nitrosphaeria (phyla Crenarchaeota). No correlation patterns between denitrification rates and system biotic and abiotic factors were observed that explained system efficiency differences.

Bacillus subtilis is well known for promoting plant growth and reducing abiotic and biotic stresses. Mutant gene-defective models can be created to understand important traits associated with rhizosphere fitness. This study aimed to analyze the role of exopolymeric genes in modulating tomato rhizosphere microbiome assembly under a gradient of soil microbiome diversities using the B. subtilis wild-type strain UD1022 and its corresponding mutant strain UD1022eps-TasA, which is defective in exopolysaccharide (EPS) and TasA protein production.

Spontaneous fermentation of cereals like millet involves a diverse population of microbes from various sources, including raw materials, processing equipment, fermenting receptacles, and the environment. Here, we present data on the predominant microbial species and their succession at each stage of the Hausa koko production process from five regions of Ghana. The isolates were enumerated using selective media, purified, and phenotypically characterised. The LAB isolates were further characterised by 16S rRNA Sanger sequencing, typed using (GTG)5 repetitive-PCR, and whole genome sequencing, while 28S rRNA Sanger sequencing was performed for yeast identification. The pH of the millet grains ranged from mean values of 6.02-6.53 to 3.51-3.99 in the final product, depending on the processors. The mean LAB and yeast counts increased during fermentation then fell to final counts of log 2.77-3.95 CFU/g for LAB and log 2.10-2.98 CFU/g for yeast in Hausa koko samples. At the various processing stages, the counts of LAB and yeast revealed significant variations (p &lt; 0.0001). The species of LAB identified in this study were Limosilactobacillus pontis, Pediococcus acidilactici, Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Limosilactobacillus reuteri, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Schleiferilactobacillus harbinensis, and Weissella confusa. The yeasts were Saccharomyces cf. cerevisiae/paradoxus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia kudriavzevii, Clavispora lusitaniae and Candida tropicalis. The identification and sequencing of these novel isolates and how they change during the fermentation process will pave the way for future controlled fermentation, safer starter cultures, and identifying optimal stages for starter culture addition or nutritional interventions. These LAB and yeast species are linked to many indigenous African fermented foods, potentially acting as probiotics in some cases. This result serves as the basis for further studies into the technological and probiotic potential of these Hausa koko microorganisms.

Microbiome dysbiosis has recently been associated with different diseases and disorders. In this context, machine learning (ML) approaches can be useful either to identify new patterns or learn predictive models. However, data to be fed to ML methods can be subject to different sampling, sequencing and preprocessing techniques. Each different choice in the pipeline can lead to a different view (i.e., feature set) of the same individuals, that classical (single-view) ML approaches may fail to simultaneously consider. Moreover, some views may be incomplete, i.e., some individuals may be missing in some views, possibly due to the absence of some measurements or to the fact that some features are not available/applicable for all the individuals. Multi-view learning methods can represent a possible solution to consider multiple feature sets for the same individuals, but most existing multi-view learning methods are limited to binary classification tasks or cannot work with incomplete views.

The selection of primer pairs in sequencing-based research can greatly influence the results, highlighting the need for a tool capable of analysing their performance in-silico prior to the sequencing process. We therefore propose PrimerEvalPy, a Python-based package designed to test the performance of any primer or primer pair against any sequencing database. The package calculates a coverage metric and returns the amplicon sequences found, along with information such as their average start and end positions. It also allows the analysis of coverage for different taxonomic levels.
