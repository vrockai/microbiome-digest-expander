Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disease with an unclear etiology and pathogenesis. Both an involvement of the immune system and gut microbiota dysbiosis have been implicated in its pathophysiology. However, potential interactions between adaptive immune responses and the microbiota in ME/CFS have been incompletely characterized. Here, we profiled antibody responses of patients with severe ME/CFS and healthy controls against microbiota and viral antigens represented as a phage-displayed 244,000 variant library. Patients with severe ME/CFS exhibited distinct serum antibody epitope repertoires against flagellins of Lachnospiraceae bacteria. Training machine learning algorithms on this antibody-binding data demonstrated that immune responses against gut microbiota represent a unique layer of information beyond standard blood tests, providing improved molecular diagnostics for ME/CFS. Together, our results point toward an involvement of the microbiota-immune axis in ME/CFS and lay the foundation for comparative studies with inflammatory bowel diseases and illnesses characterized by long-term fatigue symptoms, including post-COVID-19 syndrome.

Pneumococcal carriage has often been studied from a serotype perspective; however, little is known about the strain-specific carriage and inter-strain interactions. Here, we examined the strain-level carriage and co-colonization dynamics of Streptococcus pneumoniae in a Swiss birth cohort by PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the plyNCR marker.

Complex interactions between the gut microbiome and immune cells in infancy are thought to be part of the pathogenesis for the marked rise in pediatric allergic diseases, particularly food allergies. Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) is commonly the earliest recognized non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy in infancy and is associated with atopic dermatitis and subsequent IgE-mediated food allergy later in childhood. Yet, a large prospective longitudinal study of the microbiome of infants with FPIAP, including samples prior to symptom onset, has not been done.

## Host and gut bacteria share metabolic pathways for anti-cancer drug metabolism.

Pharmaceuticals have extensive reciprocal interactions with the microbiome, but whether bacterial drug sensitivity and metabolism is driven by pathways conserved in host cells remains unclear. Here we show that anti-cancer fluoropyrimidine drugs inhibit the growth of gut bacterial strains from 6 phyla. In both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells, fluoropyrimidines disrupt pyrimidine metabolism. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes metabolized 5-fluorouracil to its inactive metabolite dihydrofluorouracil, mimicking the major host mechanism for drug clearance. The preTA operon was necessary and sufficient for 5-fluorouracil inactivation by E. coli, exhibited high catalytic efficiency for the reductive reaction, decreased the bioavailability and efficacy of oral fluoropyrimidine treatment in mice and was prevalent in the gut microbiomes of colorectal cancer patients. The conservation of both the targets and enzymes for metabolism of therapeutics across domains highlights the need to distinguish the relative contributions of human and microbial cells to drug efficacy and side-effect profiles.

## Diet-driven microbial ecology underpins associations between cancer immunotherapy outcomes and the gut microbiome.

The gut microbiota shapes the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in cancer, however dietary and geographic influences have not been well-studied in prospective trials. To address this, we prospectively profiled baseline gut (fecal) microbiota signatures and dietary patterns of 103 trial patients from Australia and the Netherlands treated with neoadjuvant ICIs for high risk resectable metastatic melanoma and performed an integrated analysis with data from 115 patients with melanoma treated with ICIs in the United States. We observed geographically distinct microbial signatures of response and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Overall, response rates were higher in Ruminococcaceae-dominated microbiomes than in Bacteroidaceae-dominated microbiomes. Poor response was associated with lower fiber and omega 3 fatty acid consumption and elevated levels of C-reactive protein in the peripheral circulation at baseline. Together, these data provide insight into the relevance of native gut microbiota signatures, dietary intake and systemic inflammation in shaping the response to and toxicity from ICIs, prompting the need for further studies in this area.

## Advances in the gut microbiome and mood disorders.
 22.09.2022, _S Mörkl, MI Butler, S Lackner_


The gut microbiome is in constant bidirectional communication with the brain through the microbiota-gut-brain-axis. Mood disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders and include major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. The gut microbiome is altered in individuals with mood disorders and has a role in its inflammatory pathophysiology. In this article, we performed a narrative review of clinical studies, randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses addressing advances in gut microbiome research in mood disorders and included articles that were published between 2021 and 2022.

## Modulation of the intestinal microbiota impacts the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients - A recent literature survey.
 23.09.2022, _S Ziegler, S Bereswill, MM Heimesaat_


In line with the current development of individualized cancer treatments, targeted and specialized therapeutic regimens such as immunotherapy gain importance and factors improving its efficacy come into the focus of actual research. Given the orchestrated interaction of the intestinal microbiota with host immunity the modulation of the human gut microbiota represents a therapy-enhancing factor. We therefore performed an actual literature survey on the role of the gut microbiota composition and the effects of its modification during immunotherapy of cancer patients. The included 23 studies published in the past 10 years revealed that both, distinct bacterial species and genera including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium, respectively, enhanced distinct immunotherapy responses following PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockage, for instance, resulting in a better clinical outcome of cancer patients. Conversely, a high intestinal abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacterium species correlated with a less efficient immunotherapy resulting in shorter progress-free survival outcomes. In conclusion, modifications of the gut microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation or application of probiotic compounds represent potential adjunct options for immunotherapy in cancer patients which needs to be further addressed in future trials to provide individually tailored and safe adjuvant therapeutic measures in the combat of cancer.

The role of bacterial symbionts that populate octocorals (Cnidaria, Octocorallia) is still poorly understood. To shed light on their metabolic capacities, we examined 66 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) spanning 30 prokaryotic species, retrieved from microbial metagenomes of three octocoral species and seawater.
