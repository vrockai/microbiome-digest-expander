Accumulating evidence suggests that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with an altered gut microbiome. Our understanding of the underlying mechanisms has been hindered by lack of matched multi-omic data with diagnostic biomarkers. To comprehensively profile gut microbiome contributions to CVD, we generated stool metagenomics and metabolomics from 1,429 Framingham Heart Study participants. We identified blood lipids and cardiovascular health measurements associated with microbiome and metabolome composition. Integrated analysis revealed microbial pathways implicated in CVD, including flavonoid, γ-butyrobetaine, and cholesterol metabolism. Species from the Oscillibacter genus were associated with decreased fecal and plasma cholesterol levels. Using functional prediction and in vitro characterization of multiple representative human gut Oscillibacter isolates, we uncovered conserved cholesterol-metabolizing capabilities, including glycosylation and dehydrogenation. These findings suggest that cholesterol metabolism is a broad property of phylogenetically diverse Oscillibacter spp., with potential benefits for lipid homeostasis and cardiovascular health.

## Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth is associated with increased Campylobacter and epithelial injury in duodenal biopsies of Bangladeshi children.
 27.03.2024, _SM Fahim, JR Donowitz, E Smirnova, NJ Jan, S Das, M Mahfuz, SMA Gaffar, WA Petri, C Marie, T Ahmed_


Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been associated with enteric inflammation, linear growth stunting, and neurodevelopmental delays in children from low-income countries. Little is known about the histologic changes or epithelial adherent microbiota associated with SIBO. We sought to describe these relationships in a cohort of impoverished Bangladeshi children. Undernourished 12-18-month-old children underwent both glucose hydrogen breath testing for SIBO and duodenoscopy with biopsy. Biopsy samples were subject to both histological scoring and 16s rRNA sequencing. 118 children were enrolled with 16s sequencing data available on 53. Of 11 histological features, we found that SIBO was associated with one, enterocyte injury in the second part of the duodenum (R = 0.21, p = 0.02). SIBO was also associated with a significant increase in Campylobacter by 16s rRNA analysis (Log 2-fold change of 4.43; adjusted p = 1.9 x 10-6). These findings support the growing body of literature showing an association between SIBO and enteric inflammation and enterocyte injury and further delineate the subgroup of children with environmental enteric dysfunction who have SIBO. Further, they show a novel association between SIBO and Campylobacter. Mechanistic work is needed to understand the relationship between SIBO, enterocyte injury, and Campylobacter.

Pre-term birth, the leading cause of neonatal mortality, has been associated with maternal periodontal disease and the presence of oral pathogens in the placenta. However, the mechanisms that underpin this link are not known. This investigation aimed to identify the origins of placental microbiota and to interrogate the association between parturition complications and immune recognition of placental microbial motifs. Video Abstract METHODS: Saliva, plaque, serum, and placenta were collected during 130 full-term (FT), pre-term (PT), or pre-term complicated by pre-eclampsia (PTPE) deliveries and subjected to whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to measure toll-like receptors (TLR) 1-10 expression in placental samples. Source tracking was employed to trace the origins of the placental microbiota.

Chronic infection and consequent airway inflammation are the leading causes of morbidity and early mortality for people living with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, lower airway infections across a range of chronic respiratory diseases, including in CF, do not follow classical 'one microbe, one disease' concepts of infection pathogenesis. Instead, they are comprised of diverse and temporally dynamic lung infection microbiota. Consequently, temporal dynamics need to be considered when attempting to associate lung microbiota with changes in disease status. Set within an island biogeography framework, we aimed to determine the ecological patterns and processes of temporal turnover within the lung microbiota of 30 paediatric and adult CF patients prospectively sampled over a 3-year period. Moreover, we aimed to ascertain the contributions of constituent chronic and intermittent colonizers on turnover within the wider microbiota.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a challenging form of inflammatory bowel disease, and its etiology is intricately linked to disturbances in the gut microbiome. To identify the potential alleviators of UC, we employed an integrative analysis combining microbial community modeling with advanced machine learning techniques. Using metagenomics data sourced from the Integrated Human Microbiome Project, we constructed individualized microbiome community models for each participant. Our analysis highlighted a significant decline in both α and β-diversity of strain-level microbial populations in UC subjects compared to controls. Distinct differences were also observed in the predicted fecal metabolite profiles and strain-to-metabolite contributions between the two groups. Using tree-based machine learning models, we successfully identified specific microbial strains and their associated metabolites as potential alleviators of UC. Notably, our experimental validation using a dextran sulfate sodium-induced UC mouse model demonstrated that the administration of Parabacteroides merdae ATCC 43,184 and N-acetyl-D-mannosamine provided notable relief from colitis symptoms. In summary, our study underscores the potential of an integrative approach to identify novel therapeutic avenues for UC, paving the way for future targeted interventions.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common late-onset infections in preterm infants, characterized by nonspecific symptoms and a pathogenic spectrum that diverges from that of term infants and older children, which present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Existing data on the role of gut microbiota in UTI pathogenesis in this demographic are limited. This study aims to investigate alterations in gut microbiota and fecal calprotectin levels and their association with the development of UTIs in hospitalized preterm infants. A longitudinal case-control study was conducted involving preterm infants admitted between January 2018 and October 2020. Fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for microbial profiles and calprotectin levels. Propensity score matching, accounting for key perinatal factors including age and antibiotic use, was utilized to match samples from UTI-diagnosed infants to those from non-UTI counterparts. Among the 151 preterm infants studied, 53 were diagnosed with a UTI, predominantly caused by Enterobacteriaceae (79.3%) and Enterococcaceae (19.0%). Infants with UTIs showed a significantly higher abundance of these families compared to non-UTI infants, for both Gram-negative and positive pathogens, respectively. Notably, there was a significant pre-UTI increase in the abundance of pathogen-specific taxa in infants later diagnosed with UTIs, offering high predictive value for early detection. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing further confirmed the dominance of specific pathogenic species pre-UTI and revealed altered virulence factor profiles associated with Klebsiella aerogenes and Escherichia coli infections. Additionally, a decline in fecal calprotectin levels was observed preceding UTI onset, particularly in cases involving Enterobacteriaceae. The observed pathogen-specific alterations in the gut microbiota preceding UTI onset offer novel insight into the UTI pathogenesis and promising early biomarkers for UTIs in preterm infants, potentially enhancing the timely management of this common infection. However, further validation in larger cohorts is essential to confirm these findings.

To determine whether different aspects lead to a heterogeneous distribution of soil fungi, we investigated artificially established alpine grasslands in the Muli mining area in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Employing high-throughput sequencing techniques, we analyzed the composition, diversity, and function of soil fungal communities across various aspects (flat, East-facing, South-facing, West-facing, North-facing). We also examined their relationships with environmental factors. Soil fungal communities of restored alpine grasslands differed significantly across aspects in terms of the dominant phyla, classes and species level. Compared with No aspect, the Shannon index of fungi respectively decreased by 2.99%, 19.32%, 19.37% and 10.56% for East aspect, South aspect, West aspect and North aspect, respectively, and the Chao1 index of fungi respectively decreased by-2.44%, 35.50%, 42.15% and 3.21%, respectively. A total of 22 different types of fungi were identified in the study area. Predictive analysis, based on PICRUSt2, indicated that the primary functions of the fungal communities across different aspects were aerobic respiration I (cytochrome c) and aerobic respiration II (cytochrome c). Among the environmental variables, total phosphorus (P) and total nitrogen (N) were the principal factors influencing the fungal community composition.In conclusion, aspect plays a significant role in shaping the composition of fungal communities and also affects their overall diversity.

## Integrated rice-yellow catfish farming resulting in variations in the agricultural environment, rice growth performance, and soil bacterial communities.
 02.04.2024, _Y Hou, Z Yu, R Jia, B Li, J Zhu_


Different rice production patterns exert varying comprehensive impacts on the agricultural environment. Integrated rice-fish farming, an advanced and rapidly developing agricultural production pattern, aims to improve resource utilization efficiency and enhance food productivity. To unravel the responses and internal interactions of the agricultural ecological environment to integrated rice-fish farming, we assessed and compared environmental factor, rice growth performance, and soil microbiome in both integrated rice-yellow catfish farming (IRYF) and rice monoculture (RM) systems. Our results revealed significant increases in the total nitrogen and ammonia concentrations in the paddy water and soil induced by the IRYF. Rice growth performance in the IRYF group surpassed that in the RM group. IRYF obviously impacted almost all dominant bacterial phyla, genera, and functional groups (top ten most abundant), enhancing the ability of bacteria to degrade and utilize organic matter. Additionally, IRYF led to noticeable reductions in the Shannon, Simpson, Chao 1, and Pielou_J indices. IRYF strengthened the interconnections between various taxonomic units in bacterial co-occurrence network, resulting in increased complexity, stability, and disturbance resistance in the soil bacterial community. IRYF notably facilitated the transition from a community assembly dominated by stochastic processes to one dominated by deterministic processes for the soil bacterial community. The deterministic process driving this transition was variable selection. All the environmental factors, except for soil nitrate, demonstrated relatively high contributions to alterations in soil bacterial communities, with environmental variables significantly positively correlated with the soil bacterial community in the IRYF group. Alterations in functionality, composition, and diversity of the soil bacterial community were clearly associated with most environmental variables and rice growth performance indices. Our research contributed to understanding the comprehensive impacts of integrated rice-fish farming on agricultural ecosystems and provide theoretical support for achieving the sustainable agricultural production and optimizing the rice production patterns.

## Microbial terroir: associations between soil microbiomes and the flavor chemistry of mustard (Brassica juncea).
 29.03.2024, _C Walsh, C Vanderburgh, L Grant, E Katz, DJ Kliebenstein, N Fierer_


Here, we characterized the independent role of soil microbiomes (bacterial and fungal communities) in determining the flavor chemistry of harvested mustard seed (Brassica juncea). Given the known impacts of soil microbial communities on various plant characteristics, we hypothesized that differences in rhizosphere microbiomes would result in differences in seed flavor chemistry (glucosinolate content). In a glasshouse study, we introduced distinct soil microbial communities to mustard plants growing in an otherwise consistent environment. At the end of the plant life cycle, we characterized the rhizosphere and root microbiomes and harvested produced mustard seeds for chemical characterization. Specifically, we measured the concentrations of glucosinolates, secondary metabolites known to create spicy and bitter flavors. We examined associations between rhizosphere microbial taxa or genes and seed flavor chemistry. We identified links between the rhizosphere microbial community composition and the concentration of the main glucosinolate, allyl, in seeds. We further identified specific rhizosphere taxa predictive of seed allyl concentration and identified bacterial functional genes, namely genes for sulfur metabolism, which could partly explain the observed associations. Together, this work offers insight into the potential influence of the belowground microbiome on the flavor of harvested crops.

Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria are heterotrophic bacteria that supply their metabolism with light energy harvested by bacteriochlorophyll-a-containing reaction centers. Despite their substantial contribution to bacterial biomass, microbial food webs, and carbon cycle, their phenology in freshwater lakes remains unknown. Hence, we investigated seasonal variations of AAP abundance and community composition biweekly across 3 years in a temperate, meso-oligotrophic freshwater lake.

Sunlight penetrates the ice surfaces of glaciers and ice sheets, forming a water-bearing porous ice matrix known as the weathering crust. This crust is home to a significant microbial community. Despite the potential implications of microbial processes in the weathering crust for glacial melting, biogeochemical cycles, and downstream ecosystems, there have been few explorations of its microbial communities. In our study, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics of a Svalbard glacier surface catchment to characterise the microbial communities within the weathering crust, their origins and destinies, and the functional potential of the weathering crust metagenome. Our findings reveal that the bacterial community in the weathering crust is distinct from those in upstream and downstream habitats. However, it comprises two separate micro-habitats, each with different taxa and functional categories. The interstitial porewater is dominated by Polaromonas, influenced by the transfer of snowmelt, and exported via meltwater channels. In contrast, the ice matrix is dominated by Hymenobacter, and its metagenome exhibits a diverse range of functional adaptations. Given that the global weathering crust area and the subsequent release of microbes from it are strongly responsive to climate projections for the rest of the century, our results underscore the pressing need to integrate the microbiome of the weathering crust with other communities and processes in glacial ecosystems.

## Molecular-Weight-Dependent Degradation of Plastics: Deciphering Host-Microbiome Synergy Biodegradation of High-Purity Polypropylene Microplastics by Mealworms.
 02.04.2024, _L He, J Ding, SS Yang, YN Zang, JW Pang, D Xing, LY Zhang, N Ren, WM Wu_


The biodegradation of polypropylene (PP), a highly persistent nonhydrolyzable polymer, by Tenebrio molitor has been confirmed using commercial PP microplastics (MPs) (Mn 26.59 and Mw 187.12 kDa). This confirmation was based on the reduction of the PP mass, change in molecular weight (MW), and a positive Δδ13C in the residual PP. A MW-dependent biodegradation mechanism was investigated using five high-purity PP MPs, classified into low (0.83 and 6.20 kDa), medium (50.40 and 108.0 kDa), and high (575.0 kDa) MW categories to access the impact of MW on the depolymerization pattern and associated gene expression of gut bacteria and the larval host. The larvae can depolymerize/biodegrade PP polymers with high MW although the consumption rate and weight losses increased, and survival rates declined with increasing PP MW. This pattern is similar to observations with polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE), i.e., both Mn and Mw decreased after being fed low MW PP, while Mn and/or Mw increased after high MW PP was fed. The gut microbiota exhibited specific bacteria associations, such as Kluyvera sp. and Pediococcus sp. for high MW PP degradation, Acinetobacter sp. for medium MW PP, and Bacillus sp. alongside three other bacteria for low MW PP metabolism. In the host transcriptome, digestive enzymes and plastic degradation-related bacterial enzymes were up-regulated after feeding on PP depending on different MWs. The T. molitor host exhibited both defensive function and degradation capability during the biodegradation of plastics, with high MW PP showing a relatively negative impact on the larvae.
