## Bacteriophage-Bacteria Interactions in the Gut: From Invertebrates to Mammals.
 13.07.2021, _JM Kirsch, RS Brzozowski, D Faith, JL Round, PR Secor, BA Duerkop_


Bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages or phages) interact antagonistically and beneficially in polymicrobial communities such as the guts of animals. These interactions are multifaceted and are influenced by environmental conditions. In this review, we discuss phage-bacteria interactions as they relate to the complex environment of the gut. Within the mammalian and invertebrate guts, phages and bacteria engage in diverse interactions including genetic coexistence through lysogeny, and phages directly modulate microbiota composition and the immune system with consequences that are becoming recognized as potential drivers of health and disease. With greater depth of understanding of phage-bacteria interactions in the gut and the outcomes, future phage therapies become possible. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Virology, Volume 8 is September 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

## Early-life gut microbiota and its connection to metabolic health in children: Perspective on ecological drivers and need for quantitative approach.
 13.07.2021, _C Jian, N Carpén, O Helve, WM de Vos, K Korpela, A Salonen_


The colonisation and development of the gut microbiota has been implicated in paediatric metabolic disorders via its powerful effect on host metabolic and immune homeostasis. Here we summarise the evidence from human studies on the early gut microbiota and paediatric overweight and obesity. Manipulation of the early gut microbiota may represent a promising target for countering the burgeoning metabolic disorders in the paediatric population, provided the assembly patterns of microbiota and their health consequences can be decoded. Therefore, in this review, we pay particular attention to the important ecological drivers affecting the community dynamics of the early gut microbiota. We then discuss the knowledge gaps in commonly studied exposures linking the gut microbiota to metabolic disorders, especially regarding maternal factors and antibiotic use. This review also attempts to give directions for future studies aiming to identify predictive and corrective measures for paediatric metabolic disorders based on the gut microbiota.

Lung transplantation is the ultimate treatment option for patients with end-stage respiratory diseases but bears the highest mortality rate among all solid organ transplantations due to chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). The mechanisms leading to CLAD remain elusive due to insufficient understanding of the complex post-transplant adaptation processes.

## Metagenomic Analysis Reveals A Possible Association Between Respiratory Infection and Periodontitis.
 12.07.2021, _Z Liu, T Zhang, K Wu, Z Li, X Chen, S Jiang, L Du, S Lu, C Lin, J Wu, X Wang_


Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease which is characterized by progressive destruction of the periodontium and causes tooth loss in adults. Periodontitis is known to be associated with dysbiosis of the oral microflora which is often linked to various diseases. However, the complexity of plaque microbial communities of periodontitis, antibiotic resistance, and enhanced virulence make this disease difficult to treat. Therefore, we used metagenomic shotgun sequencing in this study to investigate the etiology, antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), and virulence genes (VirGs) of periodontitis. We revealed a significant shift in the composition of oral microbiota as well as several functional pathways that were represented significantly more abundant in periodontitis patients than in controls. In addition, we observed several positively selected ARGs and VirGs with the Ka/Ks ratio &gt; 1 by analyzing our data and a previous periodontitis dataset, indicating that ARGs and VirGs in oral microbiota may suffer from positive selection. Moreover, 5 of 12 positively selected ARGs and VirGs in periodontitis patients were found in the genomes of respiratory tract pathogens. Of note, 91.8% of the background VirGs with at least one non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism for natural selection were also from respiratory tract pathogens. These observations suggest a potential association between periodontitis and respiratory infection at the gene level. Our study enriches the knowledge of pathogens and functional pathways as well as the positive selection of antibiotic resistance and pathogen virulence in periodontitis patients, and provides evidence from the gene level for an association between periodontitis and respiratory infection.

## Novel mechanisms of microbial crosstalk with skin innate immunity.
 12.07.2021, _M Chinnappan, TA Harris-Tryon_


Skin is an organ with a dynamic ecosystem that harbors pathogenic and commensal microbes, which constantly communicate amongst each other and with the host immune system. Evolutionarily, skin and its microbiota have evolved to remain in homeostasis. However, frequently this homeostatic relationship is disturbed by a variety of factors such as environmental stress, diet, genetic mutations, and the microbiome itself. Commensal microbes also play a major role in the maintenance of microbial homeostasis. In addition to their ability to limit pathogens, many skin commensals such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Cutibacterium acnes have recently been implicated in disease pathogenesis either by directly modulating the host immune components or by supporting the expansion of other pathogenic microbes. Likewise, opportunistic skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus lugdunensis are able to breach the skin and cause disease. Though much has been established about the microbiota's function in skin immunity, we are in a time where newer mechanistic insights rapidly redefine our understanding of the host/microbial interface in the skin. In this review, we provide a concise summary of recent advances in our understanding of the interplay between host defense strategies and the skin microbiota.

## Shifts in the skin bacterial and fungal communities of healthy children transitioning through puberty.
 12.07.2021, _J Park, NH Schwardt, JH Jo, Z Zhang, V Pillai, S Phang, SM Brady, JA Portillo, MA MacGibeny, H Liang, M Pensler, SJ Soldin, JA Yanovski, JA Segre, HH Kong_


Previous cross-sectional studies have shown that skin microbiomes in adults are distinct from children. However, the human skin microbiome in individuals as they sexually mature has not been studied as extensively. We performed a prospective, longitudinal study to investigate puberty-associated shifts in skin microbiota. Twelve healthy children were evaluated every 6-18 months for up to 6 years. Using 16S rRNA (V1-V3) and ITS1 amplicon sequencing analyzed with DADA2, we characterized the bacterial and fungal communities of 5 different skin and nares sites. We identified significant alterations in the composition of skin microbial communities, transitioning towards a more 'adult' microbiome, during puberty. The microbial shifts were associated with Tanner stages (classification method for degree of sexual maturation) and showed noticeable sex-specific differences. Over time, female children demonstrated predominance of Cutibacterium with decreasing diversity. Among fungi, Malassezia predominated at most skin sites in more sexually mature subjects, which was more pronounced in female children. The higher relative abundances of these lipophilic taxa, Cutibacterium acnes and Malassezia restricta, were strongly associated with serum sex hormone concentrations with known influence on sebaceous gland activity. Taken together, our results support the relationship between sexual maturation, skin physiology, and the skin microbiome.

## Gut-microbiota-targeted diets modulate human immune status.

Diet modulates the gut microbiome, which in turn can impact the immune system. Here, we determined how two microbiota-targeted dietary interventions, plant-based fiber and fermented foods, influence the human microbiome and immune system in healthy adults. Using a 17-week randomized, prospective study (n = 18/arm) combined with -omics measurements of microbiome and host, including extensive immune profiling, we found diet-specific effects. The high-fiber diet increased microbiome-encoded glycan-degrading carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) despite stable microbial community diversity. Although cytokine response score (primary outcome) was unchanged, three distinct immunological trajectories in high-fiber consumers corresponded to baseline microbiota diversity. Alternatively, the high-fermented-food diet steadily increased microbiota diversity and decreased inflammatory markers. The data highlight how coupling dietary interventions to deep and longitudinal immune and microbiome profiling can provide individualized and population-wide insight. Fermented foods may be valuable in countering the decreased microbiome diversity and increased inflammation pervasive in industrialized society.

## Silent hypoxia in COVID-19: a gut microbiota connection.
 13.07.2021, _AB Gopal, S Chakraborty, PK Padhan, A Barik, P Dixit, D Chakraborty, I Poirah, S Samal, A Sarkar, A Bhattacharyya_


Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has triggered the COVID-19 pandemic. Several factors induce hypoxia in COVID-19. Despite being hypoxic, some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals do not experience any respiratory distress, a phenomenon termed "silent/happy hypoxia". Prolonged undetected hypoxia is dangerous, sometimes leading to death. A few studies attempted to unravel what causes silent hypoxia, however, the exact mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we aim to understand how SARS-CoV-2 causes silent hypoxia.

## The Athlete and Gut Microbiome: Short-chain Fatty Acids as Potential Ergogenic Aids for Exercise and Training.
 13.07.2021, _T Bongiovanni, MOL Yin, L Heaney_


Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolites produced in the gut via microbial fermentation of dietary fibers referred to as microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs). Acetate, propionate, and butyrate have been observed to regulate host dietary nutrient metabolism, energy balance, and local and systemic immune functions. In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown links between the presence of bacteria-derived SCFAs and host health through the blunting of inflammatory processes, as well as purported protection from the development of illness associated with respiratory infections. This bank of evidence suggests that SCFAs could be beneficial to enhance the athlete's immunity, as well as act to improve exercise recovery via anti-inflammatory activity and to provide additional energy substrates for exercise performance. However, the mechanistic basis and applied evidence for these relationships in humans have yet to be fully established. In this narrative review, we explore the existing knowledge of SCFA synthesis and the functional importance of the gut microbiome composition to induce SCFA production. Further, changes in gut microbiota associated with exercise and various dietary MACs are described. Finally, we provide suggestions for future research and practical applications, including how these metabolites could be manipulated through dietary fiber intake to optimize immunity and energy metabolism.

## Identification and engraftment of new bacterial strains by shotgun metagenomic sequence analysis in patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection before and after fecal microbiota transplantation and in healthy human subjects.
 12.07.2021, _S Verma, SK Dutta, E Firnberg, L Phillips, R Vinayek, PP Nair_


Recurrent Clostridioides diffícile infection (RCDI) is associated with major bacterial dysbiosis and colitis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective therapeutic modality for RCDI. While several studies have identified bacterial species associated with resolution of symptoms in patients, characterization of the fecal microbiome at the bacterial strain level in RCDI patients before and after FMT and healthy donors, has been lacking. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of bacterial strains from healthy donors to engraft in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with RCDI following FMT.

## Comparative analysis of oral-gut microbiota between captive and wild long-tailed macaque in Thailand.
 13.07.2021, _V Sawaswong, K Praianantathavorn, P Chanchaem, A Khamwut, T Kemthong, Y Hamada, S Malaivijitnond, S Payungporn_


Long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), distributed in Southeast Asia, are generally used in biomedical research. At present, the expansion of human communities overlapping of macaques' natural habitat causes human-macaque conflicts. To mitigate this problem in Thailand, the National Primate Research Center of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University (NPRCT-CU), was granted the permit to catch the surplus wild-born macaques and transfer them to the center. Based on the fact that the diets provided and the captive environments were different, their oral-gut microbiota should be altered. Thus, we investigated and compared the oral and fecal microbiome between wild-born macaques that lived in the natural habitats and those transferred to and reared in the NPRCT-CU for 1 year. The results from 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing showed that the captive macaques had distinct oral-gut microbiota profiles and lower bacterial richness compared to those in wild macaques. The gut of wild macaques was dominated by Firmicutes which is probably associated with lipid absorption and storage. These results implicated the effects of captivity conditions on the microbiome that might contribute to crucial metabolic functions. Our study should be applied to the animal health care program, with respect to microbial functions, for non-human primates.

## Impact of the dietary inclusion of dried food residues on the apparent nutrient digestibility and the intestinal microbiota of dogs.
 13.07.2021, _N Paßlack, F Galliou, T Manios, K Lasaridi, E Tsiplakou, W Vahjen, J Zentek_


The use of food residues for animal nutrition might imply ecological and economic advantages; however, their effects as a potential ingredient have not yet been evaluated in dogs. In the present study, four diets with 0, 5, 10 and 15% dried food residues (DFR), derived from hotel catering, were fed to 10 healthy adult dogs. At the end of each three-week feeding period, faeces and blood were collected. The apparent nutrient digestibility was calculated by the dietary inclusion of titanium dioxide as an inert marker. The results demonstrated that the apparent crude protein digestibility and ether extract digestibility decreased with increasing amounts of DFR in the diets (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, an increase of the faecal concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid and total short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) was observed (p &lt; 0.05). Faecal ammonium and lactate concentrations, as well as plasma phenol and indole concentrations, were not linearly affected by the dietary inclusion of DFR. The relative abundance of Fusobacteria in the faeces of the dogs decreased, and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased with increasing amounts of DFR in the diets (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the DFR seemed to be intensively fermented by the intestinal microbiota of the dogs, as indicated by the increased faecal SCFA concentrations and the shifts in the composition of the faecal microbiota. Dietary inclusion levels of up to 5% can be recommended based on our results, as the observed lower apparent crude protein and ether extract digestibility might limit the use of food residues for dogs at higher amounts.

## Triphenyltin exposure causes changes in health-associated gut microbiome and metabolites in marine medaka.
 14.07.2021, _S He, D Yu, P Li, M Zhang, S Xing, C Sun, ZH Li_


Triphenyltin (TPT), an organic compound with a wide range of applications, is often detected in water bodies and aquatic animals. However, the mechanism underlying the biological metabolic health problems caused by long-term exposure to environment concentrations of TPT remains unclear. The morphology and gene expression in the gut and liver were investigated; and 16SrRNA gene amplification sequencing and non-targeted LC-MS/MS metabonomics were investigated after marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) was treated with 1, 10, and 100 ng/L TPT for 21 days. During prolonged exposure to TPT, the adaptation mechanism maximized the energy of absorption, increased the length of intestinal microvilli, reduced the number of rough endoplasmic reticulum in the liver, and caused loss of weight. TPT exposure significantly changed the intestinal microbiome of marine medaka, thereby resulting in a significant decrease in microbial diversity. Following exposure to 100 ng/L TPT, the metabolic profiles were significantly changed and the altered metabolites were mainly concentrated in the lipid metabolic pathway. Finally, based on comprehensive network analysis, the association between the significantly changed bacteria and metabolites contributed further to the prediction of the impact of TPT on the host. This study provides a novel insight into the underlying mechanisms of host metabolic diseases caused by TPT and emphasizes the importance of monitoring pollutants in the environment.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, changes in microbiota composition as well as in the fecal, serum, and urine levels of microbial metabolites. Yet a causal relationship between dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and ASD remains to be demonstrated. Here, we hypothesized that the microbial metabolite p-Cresol, which is more abundant in ASD patients compared to neurotypical individuals, could induce ASD-like behavior in mice.

## Seven years of Progress in Determining Fungal Diversity and Characterization of Fungi Isolated from the Japanese Experiment Module KIBO, International Space Station.
 12.07.2021, _K Satoh, MM Alshahni, Y Umeda, A Komori, T Tamura, Y Nishiyama, T Yamazaki, K Makimura_


The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed facility that orbits the earth carrying not only its crew but also microorganisms. We have participated in microbiota analysis projects for the Japanese Experiment Module KIBO, ISS (operations nomenclature: Microbe-I, II, III, and IV) and were in charge of fungal screening. The interior of KIBO was sampled using swabs and microbe detection sheets (MDS) for fungal detection. The dominant genera obtained by culture were Aspergillus and Penicillium. DNA analyses of the fungal biota using a clone library showed that KIBO was dominated by Malassezia, a fungal inhabitant of human skin. Three fungal species, Aspergillus sydowii, Penicillium palitans, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, which grew under microgravity in KIBO were observed under field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on the ground. No novel phenotypic characteristics were noted. The results of antifungal susceptibility testing of all isolates did not differ significantly from previous reports of corresponding fungi. In Microbe-I (August 2009), MDS were culture negative, while in the next stages the CFU of MDS were 10 for Microbe-II (February 2011), 24 for Microbe-III (October 2012), and 151 for Microbe-IV (February 2016). These results indicated that fungi inside KIBO are increasing and expanding over time, and therefore continuous surveillance is crucial. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

## Virome studies of food production systems: time for 'farm to fork' analyses.
 12.07.2021, _J Mahony, D van Sinderen_


The food industry is under increasing pressure to produce high quality, traceable and minimally processed foods that are produced using sustainable approaches and ingredients. In line with the latter, there is an increased pressure for plant-based products to replace animal-derived products. Until recently, research efforts have mainly focused on dairy and meat products owing to their economic importance. The shift towards plant-based diets and food production requires a corresponding shift in research efforts to define the microbial requirements for and composition of (novel) plant-based foods, the (micro)organisms that are beneficial to such production systems, and the abundance and role of (bacterio)phages in shaping the microbial landscape of these foods. In this review, we explore current efforts in the area of virome analysis of foods and food production environments and highlight the need for more unified approaches to understand the contribution of phages in food safety and quality, and to develop novel tools to enhance the traceability of foods.

## D-MANOVA: fast distance-based multivariate analysis of variance for large-scale microbiome association studies.
 13.07.2021, _J Chen, X Zhang_


PERMANOVA (permutational multivariate analysis of variance based on distances) has been widely used for testing the association between the microbiome and a covariate of interest. Statistical significance is established by permutation, which is computationally intensive for large sample sizes. As large-scale microbiome studies such as American Gut Project (AGP) become increasingly popular, a computationally efficient version of PERMANOVA is much needed. To achieve this end, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the PERMANOVA pseudo-F statistic and provide analytical p-value calculation based on chi-square approximation. We show that the asymptotic p-value is close to the PERMANOVA p-value even under a moderate sample size. Moreover, it is more accurate and an order-of-magnitude faster than the permutation-free method MDMR. We demonstrated the use of our procedure D-MANOVA on the AGP dataset.

## Characterizing Microbiomes via Sequencing of Marker Loci: Techniques To Improve Throughput, Account for Cross-Contamination, and Reduce Cost.
 13.07.2021, _JG Harrison, GD Randolph, CA Buerkle_


New approaches to characterizing microbiomes via high-throughput sequencing provide impressive gains in efficiency and cost reduction compared to approaches that were standard just a few years ago. However, the speed of method development has been such that staying abreast of the latest technological advances is challenging. Moreover, shifting laboratory protocols to include new methods can be expensive and time consuming. To facilitate adoption of new techniques, we provide a guide and review of recent advances that are relevant for single-locus sequence-based study of microbiomes-from extraction to library preparation-including a primer regarding the use of liquid-handling automation in small-scale academic settings. Additionally, we describe several amendments to published techniques to improve throughput, track contamination, and reduce cost. Notably, we suggest adding synthetic DNA molecules to each sample during nucleic acid extraction, thus providing a method of documenting incidences of cross-contamination. We also describe a dual-indexing scheme for Illumina sequencers that allows multiplexing of many thousands of samples with minimal PhiX input. Collectively, the techniques that we describe demonstrate that laboratory technology need not impose strict limitations on the scale of molecular microbial ecology studies. IMPORTANCE New methods to characterize microbiomes reduce technology-imposed limitations to study design, but many new approaches have not been widely adopted. Here, we present techniques to increase throughput and reduce contamination alongside a thorough review of current best practices.

## Two-Target Quantitative PCR To Predict Library Composition for Shallow Shotgun Sequencing.
 13.07.2021, _MY Cho, M Oliva, A Spreafico, B Chen, X Wei, Y Choi, R Kaul, LL Siu, B Coburn, PHH Schneeberger_


When determining human microbiota composition, shotgun sequencing is a powerful tool that can generate high-resolution taxonomic and functional information at once. However, the technique is limited by missing information about host-to-microbe ratios observed in different body compartments. This limitation makes it difficult to plan shotgun sequencing assays, especially in the context of high sample multiplexing and limited sequencing output and is of particular importance for studies employing the recently described shallow shotgun sequencing technique. In this study, we evaluated the use of a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based assay to predict host-to-microbe ratio prior to sequencing. Combining a two-target assay involving the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the human beta-actin gene, we derived a model to predict human-to-microbe ratios from two sample types, including stool samples and oropharyngeal swabs. We then validated it on two independently collected sample types, including rectal swabs and vaginal secretion samples. This assay enabled accurate prediction in the validation set in a range of sample compositions between 4% and 98% nonhuman reads and observed proportions varied between -18.8% and +19.2% from the expected values. We hope that this easy-to-use assay will help researchers to plan their shotgun sequencing experiments in a more efficient way. IMPORTANCE When determining human microbiota composition, shotgun sequencing is a powerful tool that can generate large amounts of data. However, in sample compositions with low or variable microbial density, shallowing sequencing can negatively affect microbial community metrics. Here, we show that variable sequencing depth decreases measured alpha diversity at differing rates based on community composition. We then derived a model that can determine sample composition prior to sequencing using quantitative PCR (qPCR) data and validated the model using a separate sample set. We have included a tool that uses this model to be available for researchers to use when gauging shallow sequencing viability of samples.

## Statistical approaches for differential expression analysis in metatranscriptomics.
 13.07.2021, _Y Zhang, KN Thompson, C Huttenhower, EA Franzosa_


Metatranscriptomics (MTX) has become an increasingly practical way to profile the functional activity of microbial communities in situ. However, MTX remains underutilized due to experimental and computational limitations. The latter are complicated by non-independent changes in both RNA transcript levels and their underlying genomic DNA copies (as microbes simultaneously change their overall abundance in the population and regulate individual transcripts), genetic plasticity (as whole loci are frequently gained and lost in microbial lineages) and measurement compositionality and zero-inflation. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of and recommendations for differential expression (DE) analysis in MTX.

16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (16S analysis) is widely used to analyze microbiota with next-generation sequencing technologies. Here, we compared fecal 16S analysis data from 192 Japanese volunteers using the modified V1-V2 (V12) and the standard V3-V4 primer (V34) sets to optimize the gut microbiota analysis protocol.

The human digestion is a multi-step and multi-compartment process essential for human health, at the heart of many issues raised by academics, the medical world and industrials from the food, nutrition and pharma fields. In the first years of life, major dietary changes occur and are concomitant with an evolution of the whole child digestive tract anatomy and physiology, including colonization of gut microbiota. All these phenomena are influenced by child exposure to environmental compounds, such as drugs (especially antibiotics) and food pollutants, but also childhood infections. Due to obvious ethical, regulatory and technical limitations, in vivo approaches in animal and human are more and more restricted to favor complementary in vitro approaches. This review summarizes current knowledge on the evolution of child gut physiology from birth to 3 years old regarding physicochemical, mechanical and microbial parameters. Then, all the available in vitro models of the child digestive tract are described, ranging from the simplest static mono-compartmental systems to the most sophisticated dynamic and multi-compartmental models, and mimicking from the oral phase to the colon compartment. Lastly, we detail the main applications of child gut models in nutritional, pharmaceutical and microbiological studies and discuss the limitations and challenges facing this field of research.
