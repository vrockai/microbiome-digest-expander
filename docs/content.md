Dental implants are installed in an increasing number of patients. Mucositis and peri-implantitis are common microbial-biofilm-associated diseases affecting the tissues that surround the dental implant and are a major medical and socioeconomic burden. By metagenomic sequencing of the plaque microbiome in different peri-implant health and disease conditions (113 samples from 72 individuals), we found microbial signatures for peri-implantitis and mucositis and defined the peri-implantitis-related complex (PiRC) composed by the 7 most discriminative bacteria. The peri-implantitis microbiome is site specific as contralateral healthy sites resembled more the microbiome of healthy implants, while mucositis was specifically enriched for Fusobacterium nucleatum acting as a keystone colonizer. Microbiome-based machine learning showed high diagnostic and prognostic power for peri-implant diseases and strain-level profiling identified a previously uncharacterized subspecies of F. nucleatum to be particularly associated with disease. Altogether, we associated the plaque microbiome with peri-implant diseases and identified microbial signatures of disease severity.

## Friend or foe? The roles of inulin-type fructans.
 13.11.2020, _S Man, T Liu, Y Yao, Y Lu, L Ma, F Lu_


Inulin-type fructans (ITFs) as functional fructans and soluble dietary fiber are a mixture of inulin, oligofructose and fructooligosaccharide with β configuration. They are modified by gut microbiota at the end of ileum, subsequently, improve digestive system, metabolic syndrome, immune system and inflammatory diseases, and prevent against infection and cancer. However, it has been reported that inadequate consumption of ITFs aggravates the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, results in gastrointestinal symptoms, liver cancer and intestinal inflammation. Therefore, this review summarizes the health benefits, pharmaceutical applications and safety evaluation of ITFs, which would direct their rational applications.

## The Household Resistome: Frequency of β-Lactamases, Class 1 Integrons, and Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria in the Domestic Environment and Their Reduction during Automated Dishwashing and Laundering.
 16.11.2020, _L Schages, R Lucassen, F Wichern, R Kalscheuer, D Bockmühl_


Households provide a habitat for bacteria originating from humans, animals, foods, contaminated clothes, or other sources. Thus, bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) may be introduced via household members, animals, or the water supply from external habitats into private households and vice versa. Since data on antibiotic resistance (ABR) in the domestic environment are limited, this study aimed to determine the abundance of β-lactamase, mobile colistin resistance, and class 1 integron genes and the correlation of their presence and to characterize phenotypically resistant strains in 54 private households in Germany. Additionally, the persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria during automated dishwashing compared to that during laundering was assessed. Shower drains, washing machines, and dishwashers were sampled and analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. Resistant strains were isolated, followed by identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing using a Vitek 2 system. The results showed a significantly higher relative ARG abundance of 0.2367 ARG copies/16S rRNA gene copies in shower drains than in dishwashers (0.1329 ARG copies/16S rRNA gene copies) and washing machines (0.0006 ARG copies/16S rRNA gene copies). blaCMY-2, blaACT/MIR, and blaOXA-48 were the most prevalent ARG, and intI1 occurred in 96.3% of the households, while no mcr genes were detected. Several β-lactamase genes co-occurred, and the resistance of bacterial isolates correlated positively with genotypic resistance, with carbapenemase genes dominating across isolates. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were significantly reduced during automated dishwashing as well as laundering tests and did not differ from susceptible strains. Overall, the domestic environment may represent a potential reservoir of β-lactamase genes and β-lactam-resistant bacteria, with shower drains being the dominant source of ABR.IMPORTANCE The abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and ARGs is steadily increasing and has been comprehensively analyzed in natural environments, animals, foods, and wastewater treatment plants. In this respect, β-lactams and colistin are of particular interest due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Despite the connection of private households to these environments, only a few studies have focused on the domestic environment so far. Therefore, the present study further investigated the occurrence of ARGs and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in shower drains, washing machines, and dishwashers. The analysis of the domestic environment as a potential reservoir of resistant bacteria is crucial to determine whether households contribute to the spread of ABR or may be a habitat where resistant bacteria from the natural environment, humans, food, or water are selected due to the use of detergents, antimicrobial products, and antibiotics. Furthermore, ABR could limit the options for the treatment of infections arising in the domestic environment.
