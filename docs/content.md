## Gastrointestinal and brain barriers: unlocking gates of communication across the microbiota-gut-brain axis.
 14.02.2024, _MR Aburto, JF Cryan_


Crosstalk between gut and brain has long been appreciated in health and disease, and the gut microbiota is a key player in communication between these two distant organs. Yet, the mechanisms through which the microbiota influences development and function of the gut-brain axis remain largely unknown. Barriers present in the gut and brain are specialized cellular interfaces that maintain strict homeostasis of different compartments across this axis. These barriers include the gut epithelial barrier, the blood-brain barrier and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Barriers are ideally positioned to receive and communicate gut microbial signals constituting a gateway for gut-microbiota-brain communication. In this Review, we focus on how modulation of these barriers by the gut microbiota can constitute an important channel of communication across the gut-brain axis. Moreover, barrier malfunction upon alterations in gut microbial composition could form the basis of various conditions, including often comorbid neurological and gastrointestinal disorders. Thus, we should focus on unravelling the molecular and cellular basis of this communication and move from simplistic framing as 'leaky gut'. A mechanistic understanding of gut microbiota modulation of barriers, especially during critical windows of development, could be key to understanding the aetiology of gastrointestinal and neurological disorders.

Reptiles and amphibians (herptiles) are some of the most endangered and threatened species on the planet and numerous conservation strategies are being implemented with the goal of ensuring species recovery. Little is known, however, about the gut microbiome of wild herptiles and how it relates to the health of these populations. Here, we report results from the gut microbiome characterization of both a broad survey of herptiles, and the correlation between the fungus Basidiobolus, and the bacterial community supported by a deeper, more intensive sampling of Plethodon glutinosus, known as slimy salamanders. We demonstrate that bacterial communities sampled from frogs, lizards, and salamanders are structured by the host taxonomy and that Basidiobolus is a common and natural component of these wild gut microbiomes. Intensive sampling of multiple hosts across the ecoregions of Tennessee revealed that geography and host:geography interactions are strong predictors of distinct Basidiobolus operational taxonomic units present within a given host. Co-occurrence analyses of Basidiobolus and bacterial community diversity support a correlation and interaction between Basidiobolus and bacteria, suggesting that Basidiobolus may play a role in structuring the bacterial community. We further the hypothesis that this interaction is advanced by unique specialized metabolism originating from horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to Basidiobolus and demonstrate that Basidiobolus is capable of producing a diversity of specialized metabolites including small cyclic peptides.IMPORTANCEThis work significantly advances our understanding of biodiversity and microbial interactions in herptile microbiomes, the role that fungi play as a structural and functional members of herptile gut microbiomes, and the chemical functions that structure microbiome phenotypes. We also provide an important observational system of how the gut microbiome represents a unique environment that selects for novel metabolic functions through horizontal gene transfer between fungi and bacteria. Such studies are needed to better understand the complexity of gut microbiomes in nature and will inform conservation strategies for threatened species of herpetofauna.

## Neuroprotective Effect of a Multistrain Probiotic Mixture in SOD1G93A Mice by Reducing SOD1 Aggregation and Targeting the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.
 13.02.2024, _Z Xin, C Xin, J Huo, Q Liu, H Dong, R Li, Y Liu_


Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons. A bidirectional communication system known as the "microbiota-gut-brain" axis has a regulatory function in neurodegenerative disorders. The impact of probiotics on ALS through the "microbiota-gut-brain" axis remains uncertain. A longitudinal investigation was conducted to examine the alterations in the structure of the ileum and colon in mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1G93A) transgenic mice models of ALS by using immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Subsequently, the mice were administered a multistrain probiotic mixture (LBE) or vehicle orally, starting from 60 days of age until the terminal stage of the disease. The effects of these agents on the behavior, gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, and pathological processes of the spinal and intestine of SOD1G93A mice were analyzed, with a focus on exploring potential protective mechanisms. SOD1G93A mice exhibit various structural abnormalities in the intestine. Oral administration of LBE improved the proinflammatory response, reduced aberrant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) aggregation, and protected neuronal cells in the intestine and spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice. Furthermore, LBE treatment resulted in a change in intestinal microbiota, an increase in short-chain fatty acid levels, and an enhancement in autophagy flux. SOD1G93A mice exhibited various structural abnormalities in the intestine. LBE can improve the proinflammatory response, reduce aberrant SOD1 aggregation, and protect neuronal cells in the spinal cord and intestine of SOD1G93A mice. The positive effect of LBE can be attributed to increased short-chain fatty acids and enhanced autophagy flux.

Seagrasses offer various ecosystem services and possess high levels of primary productivity. However, the development of mariculture has affected the homeostasis of seagrass meadow ecosystems. Plant-microbiome associations are essential for seagrasses health, but little is known about the role of environmental microbiomes and how they affect seagrass in a mariculture environment. In this study, we investigated the influence of mariculture on the rhizosphere and seawater microbiome surrounding Zostera marina and focused on the bacterial, eukaryotic, and fungal components in the composition, diversity, metabolism, and responses to mariculture-related environmental factors.

## Biogeography and assembly processes of abundant and rare soil microbial taxa in the southern part of the Qilian Mountain National Park, China.
 15.02.2024, _Z Feng, N Li, Y Deng, Y Yu, Q Gao, J Wang, SL Chen, R Xing_


Soil microorganisms play vital roles in regulating multiple ecosystem functions. Recent studies have revealed that the rare microbial taxa (with extremely low relative abundances, which are still largely ignored) are also crucial in maintaining the health and biodiversity of the soil and may respond differently to environmental pressure. However, little is known about the soil community structures of abundant and rare taxa and their assembly processes in different soil layers on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). The present study investigated the community structure and assembly processes of soil abundant and rare microbial taxa on the northeastern edge of the QTP. Soil microbial abundance was defined by abundant taxa, whereas rare taxa contributed to soil microbial diversity. The results of null model show that the stochastic process ruled the assembly processes of all sub-communities. Dispersal limitation contributed more to the assembly of abundant microbial taxa in the different soil layers. In contrast, drift played a more critical role in the assembly processes of the rare microbial taxa. In addition, in contrast to previous studies, the abundant taxa played more important roles in co-occurrence networks, most likely because of the heterogeneity of the soil, the sparsity of amplicon sequencing, the sampling strategy, and the limited samples in the present study. The results of this study improve our understanding of soil microbiome assemblies on the QTP and highlight the role of abundant taxa in sustaining the stability of microbial co-occurrence networks in different soil layers.

This study entailed a comprehensive GC‚ÄíMS analysis conducted on 121 patient samples to generate a clinical breathomics dataset. Breath molecules, indicative of diverse conditions such as psychological and pathological states and the microbiome, were of particular interest due to their non-invasive nature. The highlighted noninvasive approach for detecting these breath molecules significantly enhances diagnostic and monitoring capacities. This dataset cataloged volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the breath of individuals with asthma, bronchiectasis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Uniform and consistent sample collection protocols were strictly adhered to during the accumulation of this extensive dataset, ensuring its reliability. It encapsulates extensive human clinical breath molecule data pertinent to three specific diseases. This consequential clinical breathomics dataset is a crucial resource for researchers and clinicians in identifying and exploring important compounds within the patient's breath, thereby augmenting future diagnostic and therapeutic initiatives.

## DeepMPTB: a vaginal microbiome-based deep neural network as artificial intelligence strategy for efficient preterm birth prediction.
 14.02.2024, _O Chakoory, V Barra, E Rochette, L Blanchon, V Sapin, E Merlin, M Pons, D Gallot, S Comtet-Marre, P Peyret_


In recent decades, preterm birth (PTB) has become a significant research focus in the healthcare field, as it is a leading cause of neonatal mortality worldwide. Using five independent study cohorts including 1290 vaginal samples from 561 pregnant women who delivered at term (n = 1029) or prematurely (n = 261), we analysed vaginal metagenomics data for precise microbiome structure characterization. Then, a deep neural network (DNN) was trained to predict term birth (TB) and PTB with an accuracy of 84.10% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.875 ¬± 0.11. During a benchmarking process, we demonstrated that our DL model outperformed seven currently used machine learning algorithms. Finally, our results indicate that overall diversity of the vaginal microbiota should be taken in account to predict PTB and not specific species. This artificial-intelligence based strategy should be highly helpful for clinicians in predicting preterm birth risk, allowing personalized assistance to address various health issues.

## MicroMPN: methods and software for high-throughput screening of microbe suppression in mixed populations.
 14.02.2024, _K Franco Mel√©ndez, L Schuster, MC Donahey, E Kairalla, MA Jansen, C Reisch, AR Rivers_


Screening assays are used to test if one or more microbes suppress a pathogen of interest. In the presence of more than one microbe, the screening method must be able to accurately distinguish viable pathogen cells from non-viable and non-target microbes in a sample. Current screening methods are time-consuming and require special reagents to detect viability in mixed microbial communities. Screening assays performed using soil or other complex matrices present additional challenges for screening. Here, we develop an experimental workflow based on the most probable number (MPN) assay for testing the ability of synthetic microbial communities to suppress a soil-borne pathogen. Our approach, fluorMPN, uses a fluorescently labeled pathogen and microplate format to enable high-throughput comparative screening. In parallel, we developed a command-line tool, MicroMPN, which significantly reduces the complexity of calculating MPN values from microplates. We compared the performance of the fluorMPN assay with spotting on agar and found that both methods produced strongly correlated counts of equal precision. The suppressive effect of synthetic communities on the pathogen was equally recoverable by both methods. The application of this workflow for discriminating which communities lead to pathogen reduction helps narrow down candidates for additional characterization. Together, the resources offered here are meant to facilitate and simplify the application of MPN-based assays for comparative screening projects.IMPORTANCEWe created a unified set of software and laboratory protocols for screening microbe libraries to assess the suppression of a pathogen in a mixed microbial community. Existing methods of fluorescent labeling were combined with the most probable number (MPN) assay in a microplate format to enumerate the reduction of a pathogenic soil microbe from complex soil matrices. This work provides a fluorescent expression vector available from Addgene, step-by-step laboratory protocols hosted by protocols.io, and MicroMPN, a command-line software for processing plate reader outputs. MicroMPN simplifies MPN estimation from 96- and 384-well microplates. The microplate screening assay is amenable to robotic automation with standard liquid handling robots, further reducing the hands-on processing time. This tool was designed to evaluate synthetic microbial communities for use as microbial inoculates or probiotics. The fluorMPN method is also useful for screening chemical and antimicrobial libraries for pathogen suppression in complex bacterial communities like soil.
