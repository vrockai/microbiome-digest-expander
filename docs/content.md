## Host-emitted amino acid cues regulate bacterial chemokinesis to enhance colonization.
 07.07.2021, _CD Robinson, EG Sweeney, J Ngo, E Ma, A Perkins, TJ Smith, NL Fernandez, CM Waters, SJ Remington, BJM Bohannan, K Guillemin_


Animal microbiomes are assembled predominantly from environmental microbes, yet the mechanisms by which individual symbionts regulate their transmission into hosts remain underexplored. By tracking the experimental evolution of Aeromonas veronii in gnotobiotic zebrafish, we identify bacterial traits promoting host colonization. Multiple independently evolved isolates with increased immigration harbored mutations in a gene we named sensor of proline diguanylate cyclase enzyme (SpdE) based on structural, biochemical, and phenotypic evidence that SpdE encodes an amino-acid-sensing diguanylate cyclase. SpdE detects free proline and to a lesser extent valine and isoleucine, resulting in reduced production of intracellular c-di-GMP, a second messenger controlling bacterial motility. Indeed, SpdE binding to amino acids increased bacterial motility and host colonization. Hosts serve as sources of SpdE-detected amino acids, with levels varying based on microbial colonization status. Our work demonstrates that bacteria use chemically regulated motility, or chemokinesis, to sense host-emitted cues that trigger active immigration into hosts.

The impact of the microbiome on HIV disease is widely acknowledged although the mechanisms downstream of fluctuations in microbial composition remain speculative. We detected rapid, dynamic changes in translocated microbial constituents during two years after cART initiation. An unbiased systems biology approach revealed two distinct pathways driven by changes in the abundance ratio of Serratia to other bacterial genera. Increased CD4 T cell numbers over the first year were associated with high Serratia abundance, pro-inflammatory innate cytokines, and metabolites that drive Th17 gene expression signatures and restoration of mucosal integrity. Subsequently, decreased Serratia abundance and downregulation of innate cytokines allowed re-establishment of systemic T cell homeostasis promoting restoration of Th1 and Th2 gene expression signatures. Analyses of three other geographically distinct cohorts of treated HIV infection established a more generalized principle that changes in diversity and composition of translocated microbial species influence systemic inflammation and consequently CD4 T cell recovery.

## In-vivo impact of common cosmetic preservative systems in full formulation on the skin microbiome.
 08.07.2021, _B Murphy, M Hoptroff, D Arnold, R Eccles, S Campbell-Lee_


Preservatives play an essentially role in ensuring that cosmetic formulations remain safe for use via control of microbial contamination. Commonly used preservatives include organic acids, alcohols and phenols and these play an essential role in controlling the growth of bacteria, fungi and moulds in substrates that can potentially act as a rich food source for microbial contaminants. Whilst the activity of these compounds is clear, both in vitro and in formulation, little information exists on the potential impact that common preservative systems, in full formulation, have on the skin's resident microbiome. Dysbiosis of the skin's microbiome has been associated with a number of cosmetic conditions but there currently are no in vivo studies investigating the potential for preservative ingredients, when included in personal care formulations under normal use conditions, to impact the cutaneous microbiome. Here we present an analysis of four in vivo studies that examine the impact of different preservation systems in full formulation, in different products formats, with varying durations of application. This work demonstrates that despite the antimicrobial efficacy of the preservatives in vitro, the skin microbiome is not impacted by preservative containing products in vivo.

## Antibiotics modulate neoadjuvant therapy efficiency in patients with breast cancer: a pilot analysis.
 08.07.2021, _X Zhang, L Yu, J Shi, S Li, S Yang, W Gao, S Yang, M Cheng, H Wang, Z Guo, C Geng_


Mounting evidence suggests that microbiota dysbiosis caused by antibiotic administration is a risk factor for cancer, but few research reports focus on the relationships between antibiotics and chemotherapy efficiency. We evaluated the influence of antibiotic administration on neoadjuvant therapy efficacy in patients with breast cancer (BC) in the present study. BC patients were stratified into two groups: antibiotic-treated and control based on antibiotic administration within 30 days after neoadjuvant therapy initiation. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analyses. The pathologic complete response rate of the control group was significantly higher than that of the antibiotic-treated group (29.09% vs. 10.20%, p = 0.017). Further univariate analysis with Kaplan-Meier calculations demonstrated that antibiotic administration was strongly linked with both reduced DFS (p = 0.04) at significant statistical levels and OS (p = 0.088) at borderline statistical levels. Antibiotic administration was identified as a significant independent prognostic factor for DFS [hazard ratio (HR) 3.026, 95%, confidence interval (CI) 1.314-6.969, p = 0.009] and OS (HR 2.836, 95% CI 1.016-7.858, p = 0.047) by Cox proportional hazards model analysis. Antibiotics that initiated reduced efficiency of chemotherapy were more noticeable in the HER2-positive subgroup for both DFS (HR 5.51, 95% CI 1.77-17.2, p = 0.003) and OS (HR 7.0395% CI 1.94-25.53, p = 0.003), as well as in the T3-4 subgroup for both DFS (HR 20.36, 95% CI 2.41-172.07, p = 0.006) and OS (HR 13.45, 95% CI 1.39-130.08, p = 0.025) by stratified analysis. Antibiotic administration might be associated with reduced efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy and poor prognosis in BC patients. As a preliminary study, our research made preparations for further understanding and large-scale analyses of the impact of antibiotics on the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy.

## Fecal sample collection methods and time of day impact microbiome composition and short chain fatty acid concentrations.
 08.07.2021, _J Jones, SN Reinke, A Ali, DJ Palmer, CT Christophersen_


Associations between the human gut microbiome and health outcomes continues to be of great interest, although fecal sample collection methods which impact microbiome studies are sometimes neglected. Here, we expand on previous work in sample optimization, to promote high quality microbiome data. To compare fecal sample collection methods, amplicons from the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V4) and fungal (ITS2) region, as well as short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations were determined in fecal material over three timepoints. We demonstrated that spot sampling of stool results in variable detection of some microbial members, and inconsistent levels of SCFA; therefore, sample homogenization prior to subsequent analysis or subsampling is recommended. We also identify a trend in microbial and metabolite composition that shifts over two consecutive stool collections less than 25 h apart. Lastly, we show significant differences in bacterial composition that result from collecting stool samples in OMNIgene·Gut tube (DNA Genotec) or Stool Nucleic Acid Collection and Preservation Tube (NORGEN) compared to immediate freezing. To assist with planning fecal sample collection and storage procedures for microbiome investigations with multiple analyses, we recommend participants to collect the first full bowel movement of the day and freeze the sample immediately after collection.

## The association between serum microbial DNA composition and symptoms of depression and anxiety in mood disorders.
 08.07.2021, _SJ Rhee, H Kim, Y Lee, HJ Lee, CHK Park, J Yang, YK Kim, YM Ahn_


There is increasing evidence supporting the association between gut microbiome composition and mood disorders; however, studies on the circulating microbiome are scarce. This study aimed to analyze the association of the serum microbial DNA composition with depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with mood disorders. The sera of 69 patients with mood disorders, aged from 19 to 60, were analyzed. Bacterial DNA was isolated from extracellular membrane vesicles and, subsequently, amplified and quantified with specific primers for the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rDNA gene. Sequence reads were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units and classified using the SILVA database. There were no significant associations between alpha diversity measures and the total Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) or Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) scores. Only the weighted UniFrac distance was associated with the total HAM-D score (F = 1.57, p = 0.045). The Bacteroidaceae family and Bacteroides genus were negatively associated with the total HAM-D score (β = - 0.016, p &lt; 0.001, q = 0.08 and β = - 0.016, p &lt; 0.001, q = 0.15, respectively). The Desulfovibrionaceae family and Clostridiales Family XIII were positively associated with the total BAI score (β = 1.8 × 10-3, p &lt; 0.001, q = 0.04 and β = 1.3 × 10-3, p &lt; 0.001, q = 0.24, respectively). Further studies with larger sample sizes and longitudinal designs are warranted.

Acute gastroenteritis associated with diarrhea is considered a serious disease in Africa and South Asia. In this study, we examined the trends in the causative pathogens of diarrhea and the corresponding gut microbiota in Ghana using microbiome analysis performed on diarrheic stools via 16S rRNA sequencing. In total, 80 patients with diarrhea and 34 healthy adults as controls, from 2017 to 2018, were enrolled in the study. Among the patients with diarrhea, 39 were norovirus-positive and 18 were rotavirus-positive. The analysis of species richness (Chao1) was lower in patients with diarrhea than that in controls. Beta-diversity analysis revealed significant differences between the two groups. Several diarrhea-related pathogens (e.g., Escherichia-Shigella, Klebsiella and Campylobacter) were detected in patients with diarrhea. Furthermore, co-infection with these pathogens and enteroviruses (e.g., norovirus and rotavirus) was observed in several cases. Levels of both Erysipelotrichaceae and Staphylococcaceae family markedly differed between norovirus-positive and -negative diarrheic stools, and the 10 predicted metabolic pathways, including the carbohydrate metabolism pathway, showed significant differences between rotavirus-positive patients with diarrhea and controls. This comparative study of diarrheal pathogens in Ghana revealed specific trends in the gut microbiota signature associated with diarrhea and that pathogen-dependent dysbiosis occurred in viral gastroenteritis.

## Translocation of vaginal microbiota is involved in impairment and protection of uterine health.
 08.07.2021, _J Wang, Z Li, X Ma, L Du, Z Jia, X Cui, L Yu, J Yang, L Xiao, B Zhang, H Fan, F Zhao_


The vaginal and uterine microbiota play important roles in the health of the female reproductive system. However, the interactions among the microbes in these two niches and their effects on uterine health remain unclear. Here we profile the vaginal and uterine microbial samples of 145 women, and combine with deep mining of public data and animal experiments to characterize the microbial translocation in the female reproductive tract and its role in modulating uterine health. Synchronous variation and increasing convergence of the uterine and vaginal microbiome with advancing age are shown. We also find that transplanting certain strains of vaginal bacteria into the vagina of rats induces or reduces endometritis-like symptoms, and verify the damaging or protective effects of certain vaginal bacteria on endometrium. This study clarifies the interdependent relationship of vaginal bacterial translocation with uterine microecology and endometrial health, which will undoubtedly increase our understanding of female reproductive health.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired immune-mediated disorder of the neuromuscular junction that causes fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness and fatigue. Pediatric MG and adult MG have many different characteristics, and current MG diagnostic methods for children are not quite fit. Previous studies indicate that alterations in the gut microbiota may be associated with adult MG. However, it has not been determined whether the gut microbiota are altered in pediatric MG patients.

## Theranostic cells: emerging clinical applications of synthetic biology.
 10.07.2021, _MP McNerney, KE Doiron, TL Ng, TZ Chang, PA Silver_


Synthetic biology seeks to redesign biological systems to perform novel functions in a predictable manner. Recent advances in bacterial and mammalian cell engineering include the development of cells that function in biological samples or within the body as minimally invasive diagnostics or theranostics for the real-time regulation of complex diseased states. Ex vivo and in vivo cell-based biosensors and therapeutics have been developed to target a wide range of diseases including cancer, microbiome dysbiosis and autoimmune and metabolic diseases. While probiotic therapies have advanced to clinical trials, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have received regulatory approval, exemplifying the clinical potential of cellular therapies. This Review discusses preclinical and clinical applications of bacterial and mammalian sensing and drug delivery platforms as well as the underlying biological designs that could enable new classes of cell diagnostics and therapeutics. Additionally, we describe challenges that must be overcome for more rapid and safer clinical use of engineered systems.

## Current and Future Biomarkers in Alcoholic Hepatitis.
 07.07.2021, _SM Rutledge, GY Im_


Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a clinical syndrome of jaundice, abdominal pain, and anorexia due to prolonged heavy alcohol intake, and is associated with alterations in gene expression, cytokines, immune response, and the gut microbiome. Currently, we have limited biomarkers to diagnose and prognosticate in AH, but there are many novel noninvasive biomarkers under development. We evaluate the currently used algorithms to risk-stratify in AH (such as the Maddrey modified discriminant function), and discuss novel biomarkers in development, such as breath biomarkers, microRNAs, cytokeratin-18 fragments, and the AshTest. We also review the characteristics of an ideal biomarker in AH.

## Role of bile acids in inflammatory liver diseases.
 08.07.2021, _I Evangelakos, J Heeren, E Verkade, F Kuipers_


Bile acids and their signaling pathways are increasingly recognized as potential therapeutic targets for cholestatic and metabolic liver diseases. This review summarizes new insights in bile acid physiology, focusing on regulatory roles of bile acids in the control of immune regulation and on effects of pharmacological modulators of bile acid signaling pathways in human liver disease. Recent mouse studies have highlighted the importance of the interactions between bile acids and gut microbiome. Interfering with microbiome composition may be beneficial for cholestatic and metabolic liver diseases by modulating formation of secondary bile acids, as different bile acid species have different signaling functions. Bile acid receptors such as FXR, VDR, and TGR5 are expressed in a variety of cells involved in innate as well as adaptive immunity, and specific microbial bile acid metabolites positively modulate immune responses of the host. Identification of Cyp2c70 as the enzyme responsible for the generation of hydrophilic mouse/rat-specific muricholic acids has allowed the generation of murine models with a human-like bile acid composition. These novel mouse models will aid to accelerate translational research on the (patho)physiological roles of bile acids in human liver diseases .

## Interference of dietary polyphenols with potentially toxic amino acid metabolites derived from the colonic microbiota.
 08.07.2021, _N Gasaly, M Gotteland_


Each day, varying amounts of undigested or partially digested proteins reach the colon where they are metabolized by the microbiota, resulting in the formation of compounds such as ammonia, p-cresol, skatole, phenol, indole, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). In farm animals, the excessive production of these metabolites can affect the quality of meat and milk and is a source of contaminating emissions from animal manure. In humans, their accumulation is potentially harmful, and it has been proposed that they could be involved in the development of pathologies such as colorectal cancer and ulcerative colitis, among others. This review assesses the evidence supporting the use of dietary polyphenols to reduce the production of these metabolites. Most studies have used condensed (proanthocyanidins) or hydrolyzable (ellagitannins and gallotannins) tannins, and have been carried out in farm animals. Several show that the administration of tannins in pigs, chicken, and ruminants decreases the levels of ammonia, p-cresol, skatole, and/or H2S, improving meat/milk quality and reducing manure odor. Direct application of tannins to manure also decreases ammonia emissions. Few studies were carried out in rats and humans and their results confirm, to a lesser extent, those reported in farm animals. These effects would be due to the capacity of tannins to trap ammonia and H2S, and to modify the composition of the microbiota, reducing the bacterial populations producing metabolites. In addition, PACs prevent p-cresol and H2S-induced alterations on intestinal cells in vitro. Tannins, therefore, appear as an interesting tool for improving the quality of animal products, human health, and the harmful emissions associated with breeding.

## Suppressed inflammation in obese children induced by a high-fiber diet is associated with the attenuation of gut microbial virulence factor genes.
 08.07.2021, _H Li, G Wu, L Zhao, M Zhang_


In our previous study, a gut microbiota-targeted dietary intervention with a high-fiber diet improved the immune status of both genetically obese (Prader-Willi Syndrome, PWS) and simple obese (SO) children. However, PWS children had higher inflammation levels than SO children throughout the trial, the gut microbiota of the two cohorts was similar. As some virulence factors (VFs) produced by the gut microbiota play a role in triggering host inflammation, this study compared the characteristics and changes of gut microbial VF genes of the two cohorts before and after the intervention using a fecal metagenomic dataset. We found that in both cohorts, the high-fiber diet reduced the abundance of VF, and particularly pathogen-specific, genes. The composition of VF genes was also modulated, especially for offensive and defensive VF genes. Furthermore, genes belonging to invasion, T3SS (type III secretion system), and adherence classes were suppressed. Co-occurrence network analysis detected VF gene clusters closely related to host inflammation in each cohort. Though these cohort-specific clusters varied in VF gene combinations and cascade reactions affecting inflammation, they mainly contained VFs belonging to iron uptake, T3SS, and invasion classes. The PWS group had a lower abundance of VF genes before the trial, which suggested that other factors could also be responsible for the increased inflammation in this cohort. This study provides insight into the modulation of VF gene structure in the gut microbiota by a high-fiber diet, with respect to reduced inflammation in obese children, and differences in VF genes between these two cohorts.

## Technological and environmental features determine the uniqueness of the lambic beer microbiota and production process.
 07.07.2021, _D Bongaerts, J De Roos, L De Vuyst_


Lambic beers are beers produced through spontaneous fermentation and maturation in wooden barrels. The production process of lambic beers differs from the production processes of lagers and ales in process technology, environmental parameters, and the use of specific raw materials. Moreover, every lambic beer production process is unique in terms of microbiology and flavour formation because of its dependence on the spontaneous inoculation of microorganisms coming from the environmental air (contacting the open coolship and other brewery equipment) and the inner surfaces of the barrels. Several factors influence the inter- and intraspecies microbial successions during lambic beer wort fermentation and maturation and determine the final quality of the end-products. The possibility to manually acidify the wort, the presence of species-specific metabolic traits, the environmental temperature, the co-occurrence of lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria, as well as yeasts, and the quality of the wooden barrels all determine the progress and outcome of the lambic beer production process. Further alterations in quality and flavour of lambic beers can be achieved by blending practices and additional bottle re-fermentations. This results in a vast array of lambic-derived beer products (e.g., gueuze) with complex taste and aroma profiles and specific characteristics, which separates them from most other commercially available beers.

Damage to healthy bowel tissue during pelvic radiotherapy can produce devastating and life-long changes in bowel function. The surging interest in microbiota and its importance for our wellbeing has generated a bulk of research highlighting how the food we consume impacts bowel health and disease. Dietary fiber is known to promote bowel health, yet there is a limited number of studies on dietary fiber in connection to pelvic radiotherapy. Here, we review some of the literature on the subject and present the most recent publications in the field.

## Captivity reduces diversity and shifts composition of the Brown Kiwi microbiome.

Captive rearing is often critical for animals that are vulnerable to extinction in the wild. However, few studies have investigated the extent to which captivity impacts hosts and their gut microbiota, despite mounting evidence indicating that host health is affected by gut microbes. We assessed the influence of captivity on the gut microbiome of the Brown Kiwi (Apteryx mantelli), a flightless bird endemic to New Zealand. We collected wild (n = 68) and captive (n = 38) kiwi feces at seven sites on the north island of New Zealand.

## Nitrogen Deficiency-induced Bacterial Community Shifts in Soybean Roots.
 08.07.2021, _W Yazaki, T Shimasaki, Y Aoki, S Masuda, A Shibata, W Suda, K Shirasu, K Yazaki, A Sugiyama_


Nitrogen deficiency affects soybean growth and physiology, such as symbiosis with rhizobia; however, its effects on the bacterial composition of the soybean root microbiota remain unclear. A bacterial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed nitrogen deficiency-induced bacterial community shifts in soybean roots with the marked enrichment of Methylobacteriaceae. The abundance of Methylobacteriaceae was low in the roots of field-grown soybean without symptoms of nitrogen deficiency. Although Methylobacteriaceae isolated from soybean roots under nitrogen deficiency did not promote growth or nodulation when inoculated into soybean roots, these results indicate that the enrichment of Methylobacteriaceae in soybean roots is triggered by nitrogen-deficiency stress.

 08.07.2021, _D Abedini, S Jaupitre, H Bouwmeester, L Dong_


During millions of years of evolution, land plants and microorganisms have established elaborate partnerships. Microbes play essential roles in plant fitness and help plants cope with environmental challenges. Vice versa, plants provide the microbes with a niche and food. In the soil, a complex network of interactions mediated by metabolic signals drives the relationship between plants and microbes. Here, we review the roles of metabolic signaling in the plant-microbiome interaction. We discuss how plant-produced small molecules are involved in the recruitment of the microbiome. Also the microbial partners in this relationship use small molecules, such as quorum sensing molecules and volatiles for intra-species and inter-species communication. We give an overview of the regulation of the biosynthesis, secretion and perception of both plant and microbial small molecules and discuss the examples of biotechnological approaches to engineer the plant-microbiome interaction by targeting these metabolic dialogues. Ultimately, an improved understanding of the plant-microbiome interaction and engineering possibilities will pave the way to a more sustainable agriculture.

We conducted a prospective randomized study to investigate the effect of daikenchuto (DKT) on abdominal symptoms following laparoscopic colectomy in patients with left-sided colon cancer. Patients who suffered from abdominal pain or distention on postoperative day 1 were randomized to either the DKT group or non-DKT group. The primary endpoints were the evaluation of abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and quality of life. The metabolome and gut microbiome analyses were conducted as secondary endpoints. A total of 17 patients were enrolled: 8 patients in the DKT group and 9 patients in the non-DKT group. There were no significant differences in the primary endpoints and postoperative adverse events between the two groups. The metabolome and gut microbiome analyses showed that the levels of plasma lipid mediators associated with the arachidonic acid cascade were lower in the DKT group than in the non-DKT group, and that the relative abundance of genera Serratia and Bilophila were lower in the DKT group than in the non-DKT group. DKT administration did not improve the abdominal symptoms following laparoscopic colectomy. The effects of DKT on metabolites and gut microbiome have to be further investigated.

## Effects of co-fermented collagen peptide-jackfruit juice on the immune response and gut microbiota in immunosuppressed mice.
 08.07.2021, _T Ma, C Li, F Zhao, J Cao, X Zhang, X Shen_


Recently, the development of fermented foods for ameliorating immunity and gut microbiota has attracted extensive attention. In this study, co-fermented collagen peptide-jackfruit juice was used in immunosuppressed mice to evaluate the immune response and gut microbiota modulatoration. The results showed that co-fermented peptide-jackfruit juice (FPJ) increased anti-oxidant capacity and lactic acid content. FPJ significantly promoted the immune organ (spleen and thymus) indexes, alleviated the injuries of colon tissue and stimulated the secretion of cytokines and immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG) (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, FPJ significantly upregulated the gene expression of TNF-α, IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-10, T-bet, Foxp3, RORγ and GATA3. Furthermore, FPJ improved gut microbiota composition and elevated the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentration. The relative abundances of pathogenic bacteria decreased while beneficial bacteria increased after administration FPJ. These findings suggested that FPJ could be developed as a promising functional food for immunomodulation.

## Bacteriophage-mediated modulation of microbiota for diseases treatment.
 08.07.2021, _Y Zhang, CX Li, XZ Zhang_


The symbiotic microbiota is nowadays regarded as a human "invisible organ", its imbalance has been shown to be associated with many diseases. Besides, the progress of diseases can in turn change the internal structure of microbiota. Some diseases have shown their unique microbiota markers that may be potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, modulating microbiota may be a powerful strategy for diseases treatment. However, conventional microbiota modulation strategies lack selectivity and are suffer from side effects. In recent years, with the increasing challenge of antibiotic resistance, bacteriophage (phage) therapy has gradually presented its potential to treat drug-resistant infections. Phages are viruses that infect bacteria, with high selectivity for specific bacteria and almost no tropism for mammalian cells. Studies showed that phage-mediated precise modulation of microbiota has achieved great success in diseases treatment. Here, we briefly summarized the treatment strategies of phage-mediated modulation of microbiota, and discussed prospect of possible development in this field.
