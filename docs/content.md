Respiratory mucosal host defense relies on the production of secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies, but we currently lack a fundamental understanding of how sIgA is induced by contact with microbes and how such immune responses may vary between humans. Defense of the nasal mucosal barrier through sIgA is critical to protect from infection and to maintain homeostasis of the microbiome, which influences respiratory disorders and hosts opportunistic pathogens.

## Disease-specific loss of microbial cross-feeding interactions in the human gut.
 23.10.2023, _VR Marcelino, C Welsh, C Diener, EL Gulliver, EL Rutten, RB Young, EM Giles, SM Gibbons, C Greening, SC Forster_


Many gut microorganisms critical to human health rely on nutrients produced by each other for survival; however, these cross-feeding interactions are still challenging to quantify and remain poorly characterized. Here, we introduce a Metabolite Exchange Score (MES) to quantify those interactions. Using metabolic models of prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes from over 1600 individuals, MES allows us to identify and rank metabolic interactions that are significantly affected by a loss of cross-feeding partners in 10 out of 11 diseases. When applied to a Crohn's disease case-control study, our approach identifies a lack of species with the ability to consume hydrogen sulfide as the main distinguishing microbiome feature of disease. We propose that our conceptual framework will help prioritize in-depth analyses, experiments and clinical targets, and that targeting the restoration of microbial cross-feeding interactions is a promising mechanism-informed strategy to reconstruct a healthy gut ecosystem.

Evaluation of the impact of dietary intervention on gastrointestinal microbiota and metabolites after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is lacking. We conducted a feasibility study as the first of a two-phase trial. Ten adults received resistant potato starch (RPS) daily from day -7 to day 100. The primary objective was to test the feasibility of RPS and its effect on intestinal microbiome and metabolites, including the short-chain fatty acid butyrate. Feasibility met the preset goal of 60% or more, adhering to 70% or more doses; fecal butyrate levels were significantly higher when participants were on RPS than when they were not (P &lt; 0.0001). An exploratory objective was to evaluate plasma metabolites. We observed longitudinal changes in plasma metabolites compared to baseline, which were independent of RPS (P &lt; 0.0001). However, in recipients of RPS, the dominant plasma metabolites were more stable compared to historical controls with significant difference at engraftment (P &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that RPS in recipients of allogeneic HCT is feasible; in this study, it was associated with significant alterations in intestinal and plasma metabolites. A phase 2 trial examining the effect of RPS on graft-versus-host disease in recipients of allogeneic HCT is underway. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT02763033 .

With the emergence of metagenomic data, multiple links between the gut microbiome and the host health have been shown. Deciphering these complex interactions require evolved analysis methods focusing on the microbial ecosystem functions. Despite the fact that host or diet-derived fibres are the most abundant nutrients available in the gut, the presence of distinct functional traits regarding fibre and mucin hydrolysis, fermentation and hydrogenotrophic processes has never been investigated.

## The airway microbiota of neonates colonized with asthma-associated pathogenic bacteria.

Culture techniques have associated colonization with pathogenic bacteria in the airways of neonates with later risk of childhood asthma, whereas more recent studies utilizing sequencing techniques have shown the same phenomenon with specific anaerobic taxa. Here, we analyze nasopharyngeal swabs from 1 month neonates in the COPSAC2000 prospective birth cohort by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region in relation to asthma risk throughout childhood. Results are compared with previous culture results from hypopharyngeal aspirates from the same cohort and with hypopharyngeal sequencing data from the later COPSAC2010 cohort. Nasopharyngeal relative abundance values of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are associated with the same species in the hypopharyngeal cultures. A combined pathogen score of these bacteria's abundance values is associated with persistent wheeze/asthma by age 7. No other taxa are associated. Compared to the hypopharyngeal aspirates from the COPSAC2010 cohort, the anaerobes Veillonella and Prevotella, which have previously been implicated in asthma development, are less commonly detected in the COPSAC2000 nasopharyngeal samples, but correlate with the pathogen score, hinting at latent community structures that bridge current and previous results. These findings have implications for future asthma prevention efforts.

Leishmania braziliensis is a parasitic infection that can result in inflammation and skin injury with highly variable and unpredictable clinical outcomes. Here, we investigated the potential impact of microbiota on infection-induced inflammatory responses and disease resolution by conducting an integrated analysis of the skin microbiome and host transcriptome on a cohort of 62 patients infected with L. braziliensis. We found that overall bacterial burden and microbiome configurations dominated with Staphylococcus spp. were associated with delayed healing and enhanced inflammatory responses, especially by IL-1 family members. Quantification of host and bacterial transcripts on human lesions revealed that high lesional S. aureus transcript abundance was associated with delayed healing and increased expression of IL-1β. This cytokine was critical for modulating disease outcomes in L. braziliensis-infected mice colonized with S. aureus, given that its neutralization reduced pathology and inflammation. These results highlight how the human microbiome can shape disease outcomes in cutaneous leishmaniasis and suggest pathways toward host-directed therapies to mitigate the inflammatory consequences.

## Analysis of the influence of host lifestyle (coffee consumption, drinking, and smoking) on Korean oral microbiome.
 20.10.2023, _KM Yu, HS Cho, AM Lee, JW Lee, SK Lim_


If a DNA sample collected in the field is old or degraded, short tandem repeat analysis is difficult to perform, a representative analysis method currently used for individual identification. Given that microorganisms exist everywhere and within the human body, in similar amounts to human cells, microbial analysis could be used to identify individuals even in cases in which human DNA-based identification is difficult. Research has demonstrated that the types of microorganisms within the human body differ depending on various internal or external factors, such as body part or bodily fluid type, lifestyle, geographical area of residence, sex, and age. In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship between lifestyle factors and the composition and diversity of the oral microbiome in individuals living in Korea. We collected 43 saliva samples from Korean individuals and analyzed the oral microbiome and its variations due to external factors, such as coffee consumption, drinking, and smoking. Linear discriminant analysis effect size revealed that Oribacterium, Campylobacter, and Megasphaera were abundant in coffee consumers, whereas Saccharimonadales, Clostridia, and Catonella were abundant in alcohol non-drinkers. We found increased levels of Stomatobaculum in the saliva of smokers, compared with that of non-smokers. Thus, our analysis revealed characteristic microorganisms for each parameter that was evaluated (coffee consumption, smoking, drinking). Consequently, our study provides insight into the oral microbiome in the Korean population and lays the foundation for developing the Korean Forensic Microbiome Database.

## Potential roles of gut microbiota in metal mixture and bone mineral density and osteoporosis risk association: an epidemiologic study in Wuhan.
 21.10.2023, _J Zhang, Q Mai, D Di, H Zhou, R Zhang, Q Wang_


Few studies have focused on the effects of multiple metal mixtures on bone health and the underlying mechanisms related to alterations in the gut microbiota. This study aimed to examine the potential roles of gut microbiota alterations in metal mixtures and their association with osteoporosis traits. Adults aged ≥ 55 years were recruited from two community healthcare centers in Wuhan City during 2016-2019. The plasma concentrations of six metals (zinc, iron, selenium, lead, cadmium, and arsenic) were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The k-means clustering method was employed to explore the exposure profiles of metal mixtures for all participants. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to profile the gut microbiota of participants. Combining these results with those of our previous study, we identified overlapping taxa and evaluated their potential roles. A total of 806 participants (516 females), with an average age of 67.36 years were included. The participants were grouped into three clusters using k-means clustering: Cluster 1 (n = 458), Cluster 2 (n = 199), and Cluster 3 (n = 149). The high-exposure group for iron, zinc, lead, and cadmium (Cluster 3) showed a negative association with lumbar spine 1-4 bone mineral density (BMD). A total of 201 individuals (121 females) underwent sequencing of the gut microbiota. Both alpha and beta diversities were statistically different among the three groups. Bacteroidaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Bacteroides, and Lachnospiraceae_incertae_sedis were identified as overlapping taxa associated with the metal mixtures and BMD. Interaction analysis revealed that Cluster 3 interacted with Bacteroidaceae/Bacteroides, resulting in a positive effect on LS1-4 BMD (β = 0.358 g/cm2, 95% CI: 0.047 to 0.669, P = 0.025). Our findings indicate associations between multiple metal mixtures and BMD as well as gut microbiota alterations. Exploring the interaction between metal mixtures and the gut microbiota provides new perspectives for the precise prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.

Depression is a chronic, relapsing mental illness, often accompanied by loss of appetite, increased fatigue, insomnia and poor concentration. Here, we performed serum and urine metabolomics and fecal 16S rDNA sequencing studies on 57 unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 57 healthy controls to characterize the metabolic and flora profile of MDD patients. We observed significant differences in serum and urinary metabolome between MDD patients and healthy individuals. Specifically, glycerophospholipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism were significantly disordered in serum, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, arginine biosynthesis, purine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism were significantly impaired in urine. On this basis, we identified four potential diagnostic biomarkers for carnitine and four fatty acid classes in serum and urine, respectively. In addition, we observed significant disturbances of the gut microbiota in MDD patients. Spearman correlation analysis showed that imbalances in the gut microbiota were associated with metabolic disturbances, suggesting an important role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of MDD. Our study provides a theoretical basis for further understanding of the pathogenesis of depression and for future clinical diagnosis and screening, as well as a basis for targeting the gut flora to optimize its structure for the prevention and treatment of depression.

## The total mass, number, and distribution of immune cells in the human body.
 23.10.2023, _R Sender, Y Weiss, Y Navon, I Milo, N Azulay, L Keren, S Fuchs, D Ben-Zvi, E Noor, R Milo_


The immune system is a complex network of cells with critical functions in health and disease. However, a comprehensive census of the cells comprising the immune system is lacking. Here, we estimated the abundance of the primary immune cell types throughout all tissues in the human body. We conducted a literature survey and integrated data from multiplexed imaging and methylome-based deconvolution. We also considered cellular mass to determine the distribution of immune cells in terms of both number and total mass. Our results indicate that the immune system of a reference 73 kg man consists of 1.8 × 1012 cells (95% CI 1.5-2.3 × 1012), weighing 1.2 kg (95% CI 0.8-1.9). Lymphocytes constitute 40% of the total number of immune cells and 15% of the mass and are mainly located in the lymph nodes and spleen. Neutrophils account for similar proportions of both the number and total mass of immune cells, with most neutrophils residing in the bone marrow. Macrophages, present in most tissues, account for 10% of immune cells but contribute nearly 50% of the total cellular mass due to their large size. The quantification of immune cells within the human body presented here can serve to understand the immune function better and facilitate quantitative modeling of this vital system.

## Regulation of pain perception by microbiota in Parkinson's Disease.
 20.10.2023, _Z Manjarres, M Calvo, R Pacheco_


Pain perception involves current stimulation in peripheral nociceptive nerves and the subsequent stimulation of postsynaptic excitatory neurons in the spinal cord. Importantly, in chronic pain, the neural activity of both peripheral nociceptors and postsynaptic neurons in the central nervous system is influenced by several inflammatory mediators produced by the immune system. Growing evidence has indicated that the commensal microbiota plays an active role in regulating pain perception by either acting directly on nociceptors or indirectly through the modulation of the inflammatory activity on immune cells. This symbiotic relationship is mediated by soluble bacterial mediators or intrinsic structural components of bacteria that act on eukaryotic cells, including neurons, microglia, astrocytes, macrophages, T-cells, enterochromaffin cells, and enteric glial cells. The molecular mechanisms involve bacterial molecules that act directly on neurons affecting their excitability, or indirectly on non-neuronal cells inducing changes in the production of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators. Importantly, Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorder that affect mainly the dopaminergic neurons implicated in the control of voluntary movements, involves not only a motor decline but also non-motor symptomatology, including chronic pain. Of note, several recent studies have shown that Parkinson's disease involves a dysbiosis in the composition of the gut microbiota. In this review, first, we summarize, integrate and classify the molecular mechanisms implicated in the microbiota-mediated regulation of chronic pain. Secondly, we analyze the changes on the commensal microbiota associated to Parkinson's disease and propose how these changes affect the development of chronic pain in this pathology. Significance Statement The microbiota regulates chronic-pain through the action of bacterial signals into two main locations: the peripheral nociceptors and the postsynaptic excitatory neurons in the spinal cord. The dysbiosis associated to Parkinson's disease reveals increased representation of commensals that potentially exacerbate chronic pain and reduced levels of bacteria with beneficial effects on pain. This review encourages further research to better understand the signals involved in bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host communication to get the clues for the development of probiotics with therapeutic potential.

## Single-cell analysis and spatial resolution of the gut microbiome.
 23.10.2023, _B Madhu, BM Miller, M Levy_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Microbiota, Bacteria, Dysbiosis, Single-Cell Analysis_
Over the past decade it has become clear that various aspects of host physiology, metabolism, and immunity are intimately associated with the microbiome and its interactions with the host. Specifically, the gut microbiome composition and function has been shown to play a critical role in the etiology of different intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases. While attempts to identify a common pattern of microbial dysbiosis linked with these diseases have failed, multiple studies show that bacterial communities in the gut are spatially organized and that disrupted spatial organization of the gut microbiome is often a common underlying feature of disease pathogenesis. As a result, focus over the last few years has shifted from analyzing the diversity of gut microbiome by sequencing of the entire microbial community, towards understanding the gut microbiome in spatial context. Defining the composition and spatial heterogeneity of the microbiome is critical to facilitate further understanding of the gut microbiome ecology. Development in single cell genomics approach has advanced our understanding of microbial community structure, however, limitations in approaches exist. Single cell genomics is a very powerful and rapidly growing field, primarily used to identify the genetic composition of microbes. A major challenge is to isolate single cells for genomic analyses. This review summarizes the different approaches to study microbial genomes at single-cell resolution. We will review new techniques for microbial single cell sequencing and summarize how these techniques can be applied broadly to answer many questions related to the microbiome composition and spatial heterogeneity. These methods can be used to fill the gaps in our understanding of microbial communities.

Like its human counterpart, canine atopic dermatitis (cAD) is a chronic relapsing condition; thus, most cAD-affected dogs will require lifelong treatment to maintain an acceptable quality of life. A potential intervention is modulation of the composition of gut microbiota, and in fact, probiotic treatment has been proposed and tried in human atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. Since dogs are currently receiving intensive medical care, this will be the same option for dogs, while evidence of gut dysbiosis in cAD is still missing, although skin microbial profiling in cAD has been conducted in several studies. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of both gut and skin microbiota in cAD in one specific cAD-predisposed breed, Shiba Inu. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of commonly used medical management on cAD (Janus kinase; JAK inhibitor, oclacitinib) on the gut and skin microbiota. Furthermore, we genotyped the Shiba Inu dogs according to the mitochondrial DNA haplogroup and assessed its association with the composition of the gut microbiota.

_Humans, Ecosystem, Radon, Spain, Phylogeny, Bacteria, Archaea, Microbiota, Adenosine Triphosphate_
Castañar Cave (Caceres, Spain) is a unique show cave known for its high natural radiation levels. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of its prokaryotic diversity, specifically focusing on investigating the influence of environmental conditions and substrate characteristics on the prokaryotic community structure in the cave sediments. Additionally, the research aims to evaluate the potential impact of human activities on the cave ecosystem. The identification of distinct bioclimatic zones within the cave was made possible through a combination of environmental and microbial monitoring (ATP assays). The results reveal sediment texture as a significant factor, notably affecting the structure, diversity, and phylogenetic variability of the microbial community, including both Bacteria and Archaea. The proportion of clay minerals in sediments plays a crucial role in regulating moisture levels and nutrient availability. These substrate properties collectively exert a significant selective pressure on the structure of prokaryotic communities within cave sediments. The molecular approach shows that heterotrophic bacteria, including those with chitinolytic enzymes, primarily inhabit the cave. Furthermore, chemoautotrophic nitrifiers such as the archaea Nitrososphaeria and the genus Nitrospira, as well as methanotrophic bacteria from the phyla Methylomirabilota, Pseudomonadota, and Verrucomicrobiota, are also present. Remarkably, despite being a show cave, the cave microbiota displays minimal impacts from human activities and the surface ecosystem. Prokaryotic populations exhibit stability in the innermost areas, while the tourist trail area experiences slightly higher biomass increases due to visitor traffic. This suggests that conservation efforts have successfully limited the entry of external nutrients into the innermost cave areas. Additionally, the results suggest that integrating biomarkers like ATP into environmental monitoring can significantly enhance the methods used to study the negative impacts of tourism on cave ecosystems.

## The interplay between microbial communities and soil properties.
 20.10.2023, _L Philippot, C Chenu, A Kappler, MC Rillig, N Fierer_


In recent years, there has been considerable progress in determining the soil properties that influence the structure of the soil microbiome. By contrast, the effects of microorganisms on their soil habitat have received less attention with most previous studies focusing on microbial contributions to soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. However, soil microorganisms are not only involved in nutrient cycling and organic matter transformations but also alter the soil habitat through various biochemical and biophysical mechanisms. Such microbially mediated modifications of soil properties can have local impacts on microbiome assembly with pronounced ecological ramifications. In this Review, we describe the processes by which microorganisms modify the soil environment, considering soil physics, hydrology and chemistry. We explore how microorganism-soil interactions can generate feedback loops and discuss how microbially mediated modifications of soil properties can serve as an alternative avenue for the management and manipulation of microbiomes to combat soil threats and global change.

## Hierarchical eco-evo dynamics mediated by the gut microbiome.
 20.10.2023, _E Decaestecker, B Van de Moortel, S Mukherjee, A Gurung, R Stoks, L De Meester_


The concept of eco-evolutionary (eco-evo) dynamics, stating that ecological and evolutionary processes occur at similar time scales and influence each other, has contributed to our understanding of responses of populations, communities, and ecosystems to environmental change. Phenotypes, central to these eco-evo processes, can be strongly impacted by the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome shapes eco-evo dynamics in the host community through its effects on the host phenotype. Complex eco-evo feedback loops between the gut microbiome and the host communities might thus be common. Bottom-up dynamics occur when eco-evo interactions shaping the gut microbiome affect host phenotypes with consequences at population, community, and ecosystem levels. Top-down dynamics occur when eco-evo dynamics shaping the host community structure the gut microbiome.
