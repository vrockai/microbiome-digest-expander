Microbial exposures in early childhood direct the development of the immune system and their diversity may influence the risk of allergy development. We aimed to determine whether the indoor microbial diversity at early-life is associated with the development of allergic rhinitis and inhalant atopy.

## Can we modulate the breastfed infant gut microbiota through maternal diet?
 11.02.2021, _AS Sindi, DT Geddes, ME Wlodek, BS Muhlhausler, MS Payne, LF Stinson_


Initial colonisation of the infant gut is robustly influenced by regular ingestion of human milk, a substance that contains microbes, microbial metabolites, immune proteins, and oligosaccharides. Numerous factors have been identified as potential determinants of the human milk and infant gut microbiota, including maternal diet; however, there is limited data on the influence of maternal diet during lactation on either of these. Here, we review the processes thought to contribute to human milk and infant gut bacterial colonisation and provide a basis for considering the role of maternal dietary patterns during lactation in shaping infant gut microbial composition and function. Although only one observational study has directly investigated the influence of maternal diet during lactation on the infant gut microbiome, data from animal studies suggests that modulation of the maternal gut microbiota, via diet or probiotics, may influence the mammary or milk microbiota. Additionally, evidence from human studies suggests that the maternal diet during pregnancy may affect the gut microbiota of the breastfed infant. Together, there is a plausible hypothesis that maternal diet during lactation may influence the infant gut microbiota. If substantiated in further studies, this may present a potential window of opportunity for modulating the infant gut microbiome in early life.

## The Effects of Genetic Relatedness on the Preterm Infant Gut Microbiota.
 12.02.2021, _SJ Lim, M Aguilar-Lopez, C Wetzel, SVO Dutra, V Bray, MW Groer, SM Donovan, T Ho_


The preterm infant gut microbiota is influenced by environmental, endogenous, maternal, and genetic factors. Although siblings share similar gut microbial composition, it is not known how genetic relatedness affects alpha diversity and specific taxa abundances in preterm infants. We analyzed the 16S rRNA gene content of stool samples, ≤ and &gt;3 weeks postnatal age, and clinical data from preterm multiplets and singletons at two Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), Tampa General Hospital (TGH; FL, USA) and Carle Hospital (IL, USA). Weeks on bovine milk-based fortifier (BMF) and weight gain velocity were significant predictors of alpha diversity. Alpha diversity between siblings were significantly correlated, particularly at ≤3 weeks postnatal age and in the TGH NICU, after controlling for clinical factors. Siblings shared higher gut microbial composition similarity compared to unrelated individuals. After residualizing against clinical covariates, 30 common operational taxonomic units were correlated between siblings across time points. These belonged to the bacterial classes Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Bacteroidia, Clostridia, Erysipelotrichia, and Negativicutes. Besides the influence of BMF and weight variables on the gut microbial diversity, our study identified gut microbial similarities between siblings that suggest genetic or shared maternal and environmental effects on the preterm infant gut microbiota.

## Inflammatory bowel disease: tri-directional relationship between microbiota, immune system and intestinal epithelium.
 12.02.2021, _S Ahlawat, P Kumar, H Mohan, S Goyal, KK Sharma_


Human gut microbiota contributes to host nutrition and metabolism, sustains intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation, and modulates host immune system. The alterations in their composition lead to severe gut disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS). IBD including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are gamut of chronic inflammatory disorders of gut, mediated by complex interrelations among genetic, environmental, and internal factors. IBD has debateable aetiology, however in recent years, exploring the central role of a tri-directional relationship between gut microbiota, mucosal immune system, and intestinal epithelium in pathogenesis is getting the most attention. Increasing incidences and early onset explains the exponential rise in IBD burden on health-care systems. Industrialization, hypersensitivity to allergens, lifestyle, hygiene hypothesis, loss of intestinal worms, and gut microbial composition, explains this shifted rise. Hitherto, the interventions modulating gut microbiota composition, microfluidics-based in vitro gastrointestinal models, non-allergic functional foods, nutraceuticals, and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy donors are some of the futuristic approaches for the disease management.

## The baseline gut microbiota directs dieting-induced weight loss trajectories.

Elucidating key factors affecting personal responses to food is the first step towards implementing personalized nutrition strategies in e.g. weight loss programs. We here aimed to identify factors of importance for individual weight loss trajectories in a natural setting where subjects were provided dietary advice but otherwise asked to self-manage the daily caloric intake and data reporting.
