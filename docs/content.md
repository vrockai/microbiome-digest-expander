The host-seeking activity of hematophagous arthropods is essential for arboviral transmission. Here, we demonstrate that mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses can manipulate host skin microbiota to produce a scent that attracts mosquitoes. We observed that Aedes mosquitoes preferred to seek and feed on mice infected by dengue and Zika viruses. Acetophenone, a volatile compound that is predominantly produced by the skin microbiota, was enriched in the volatiles from the infected hosts to potently stimulate mosquito olfaction for attractiveness. Of note, acetophenone emission was higher in dengue patients than in healthy people. Mechanistically, flaviviruses infection suppressed the expression of RELMα, an essential antimicrobial protein on host skin, thereby leading to the expansion of acetophenone-producing commensal bacteria and, consequently, a high acetophenone level. Given that RELMα can be specifically induced by a vitamin A derivative, the dietary administration of isotretinoin to flavivirus-infected animals interrupted flavivirus life cycle by reducing mosquito host-seeking activity, thus providing a strategy of arboviral control.

## Dynamic Alterations in the Respiratory Tract Microbiota of Patients with COVID-19 and its Association with Microbiota in the Gut.
 03.07.2022, _Y Shen, F Yu, D Zhang, Q Zou, M Xie, X Chen, L Yuan, B Lou, G Xie, R Wang, X Yang, W Chen, Q Wang, B Feng, Y Teng, Y Dong, L Huang, J Bao, D Han, C Liu, W Wu, X Liu, L Fan, MP Timko, S Zheng, Y Chen_


The role of respiratory tract microbes and the relationship between respiratory tract and gut microbiomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain uncertain. Here, the metagenomes of sputum and fecal samples from 66 patients with COVID-19 at three stages of disease progression are sequenced. Respiratory tract, gut microbiome, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples are analyzed to compare the gut and respiratory tract microbiota of intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU (nICU) patients and determine relationships between respiratory tract microbiome and immune response. In the respiratory tract, significantly fewer Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Atopobium, and Bacteroides are found in ICU than in nICU patients, while Enterococcus and Candida increase. In the gut, significantly fewer Bacteroides are found in ICU patients, while Enterococcus increases. Significant positive correlations exist between relative microbiota abundances in the respiratory tract and gut. Defensin-related pathways in PBMCs are enhanced, and respiratory tract Streptococcus is reduced in patients with COVID-19. A respiratory tract-gut microbiota model identifies respiratory tract Streptococcus and Atopobium as the most prominent biomarkers distinguishing between ICU and nICU patients. The findings provide insight into the respiratory tract and gut microbial dynamics during COVID-19 progression, considering disease severity, potentially contributing to diagnosis, and treatment strategies.

## Interaction of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with host CD36 genetic variant for gut microbiome and blood lipids in human cohorts.
 06.07.2022, _Z Miao, GD Chen, S Huo, Y Fu, MY Wu, F Xu, Z Jiang, J Tang, W Gou, C Xiao, YP Liu, YY Wu, TY Sun, L Sun, LR Shen, X Lin, YM Chen, JS Zheng_


Previous studies suggest an interaction of CD36 genetic variant rs1527483 with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to modulate blood lipids. However, successful replication is lacking and the role of gut microbiome remains unclear. Here, we aimed to replicate these gene-diet interactions on blood lipids and investigate their possible associations with gut microbiome.

## A weight-loss model based on baseline microbiota and genetic scores for selection of dietary treatments in overweight and obese population.
 06.07.2022, _A Cuevas-Sierra, FI Milagro, E Guruceaga, M Cuervo, L Goni, M García-Granero, JA Martinez, JI Riezu-Boj_


The response to weight loss depends on the interindividual variability of determinants such as gut microbiota and genetics. The aim of this investigation was to develop an integrative model using microbiota and genetic information to prescribe the most suitable diet for a successful weight loss in individuals with excess of body weight.

## Multi-omics data reveals the disturbance of glycerophospholipid metabolism caused by disordered gut microbiota in depressed mice.

Although researchers have done intensive research on depression, its pathogenesis is still not fully explained. More and more evidence suggests that gut microbiota is closely related to the onset of depression; but its specific functional ways are not clearly identified.
