_Humans, Metagenomics_
While microbiomes in industrialized societies are well characterized, indigenous populations with traditional lifestyles have microbiomes that are more akin to those of ancient humans. However, metagenomic data in these populations remains scarce, and the association with soil-transmitted helminth infection status is unclear. Here, we sequenced 650 metagenomes of indigenous Malaysians from five villages with different prevalence of helminth infections.

From a theoretical ecology point of view, microbiomes are far more complex than expected. Besides competition and competitive exclusion, cooperative microbe-microbe interactions have to be carefully considered. Metabolic dependencies among microbes likely explain co-existence in microbiota.

## Dynamics of rice microbiomes reveal core vertically transmitted seed endophytes.

_Oryza, Endophytes, Seeds_
Plants and their associated microbiota constitute an assemblage of species known as holobionts. The plant seed microbiome plays an important role in nutrient uptake and stress attenuation. However, the core vertically transmitted endophytes remain largely unexplored.

## Predominance of Methanomicrobiales and diverse hydrocarbon-degrading taxa in the Appalachian coalbed biosphere revealed through metagenomics and genome-resolved metabolisms.
 07.11.2022, _DE Ross, D Lipus, D Gulliver_


Coalbed deposits are a unique subsurface environment and represent an underutilized resource for methane generation. Microbial communities extant in coalbed deposits are responsible for key subsurface biogeochemical cycling and could be utilized to enhance methane production in areas where existing gas wells have depleted methane stores, or in coalbeds that are unmined, or conversely be utilized for mitigation of methane release. Here we utilize metagenomics and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to identify extant microbial lineages and genome-resolved microbial metabolisms of coalbed produced water, which has not yet been explored in the Appalachian Basin (AppB). Our analyses resulted in the recovery of over 40 MAGs from 8 coalbed methane wells. The most commonly identified taxa among samples were hydrogenotrophic methanogens from the order Methanomicrobiales and these dominant MAGs were highly similar to one another. Conversely, low-abundance coalbed bacterial populations were taxonomically and functionally diverse, mostly belonging to a variety of Proteobacteria classes, and encoding various hydrocarbon solubilization and degradation pathways. The data presented herein provides novel insights into AppB coalbed microbial ecology, and our findings provide new perspectives on underrepresented Methanocalculus species and low-relative abundance bacterial assemblages in coalbed environments, and their potential roles in stimulation or mitigation of methane release.
