## Evaluation of microbiome-host relationships in the zebrafish gastrointestinal system reveals adaptive immunity is a target of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure.

To improve physical characteristics of plastics such as flexibility and durability, producers enrich materials with phthalates such as di-2-(ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). DEHP is a high production volume chemical associated with metabolic and immune disruption in animals and humans. To reveal mechanisms implicated in phthalate-related disruption in the gastrointestinal system, male and female zebrafish were fed DEHP (3 ppm) daily for two months. At the transcriptome level, DEHP significantly upregulated gene networks in the intestine associated with helper T cells (Th1, Th2 and Th17) specific pathways. The activation of gene networks associated with adaptive immunity were linked to the suppression of networks for tight junction, gap junctional intercellular communication, and transmembrane transporters, all of which are precursors for impaired gut integrity and performance. On a class level, DEHP exposure increased Bacteroidia and Gammaproteobacteria and decreased Verrucomicrobiae in both the male and female gastrointestinal system. Further, in males there was a relative increase in Fusobacteriia, Betaproteobacteria and a relative decrease in Saccharibacteria. Predictive algorithms revealed the functional shift in the microbiome community, and the metabolites they produce, act to modulate intestinal adaptive immunity. This finding suggests that the gut microbiota may contribute to the adverse effects of DEHP on the host by altering metabolites sensed by both intestinal and immune Th cells. Our results suggest that the microbiome-gut-immune axis can be modified by DEHP and emphasizes the value of multi-omics approaches to study microbiome-host interactions following chemical perturbations.

## Abnormal gut microbiota composition is associated with experimental autoimmune prostatitis-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice.
 07.04.2020, _HX Du, Y Liu, LG Zhang, CS Zhan, J Chen, M Zhang, XG Chen, L Zhang, CZ Liang_


Depressive symptoms are found in approximately 78% of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) patients, but the pathological mechanisms remain unknown. Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal gut microbiota may play an important role in depression. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether gut microbiota contributes to CP/CPPS-associated depression by using a mouse model of experimental autoimmune prostatitis (EAP).

## Impact of phages on soil bacterial communities and nitrogen availability under different assembly scenarios.
 13.04.2020, _LPP Braga, A Spor, W Kot, MC Breuil, LH Hansen, JC Setubal, L Philippot_


Bacteriophages, the viruses infecting bacteria, are biological entities that can control their host populations. The ecological relevance of phages for microbial systems has been widely explored in aquatic environments, but the current understanding of the role of phages in terrestrial ecosystems remains limited. Here, our objective was to quantify the extent to which phages drive the assembly and functioning of soil bacterial communities. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment using natural and sterilized soil incubated with different combinations of two soil microbial communities, challenged against native and non-native phage suspensions as well as against a cocktail of phage isolates. We tested three different community assembly scenarios by adding phages: (a) during soil colonization, (b) after colonization, and (c) in natural soil communities. One month after inoculation with phage suspensions, bacterial communities were assessed by 16S rRNA amplicon gene sequencing.

## A predatory myxobacterium controls cucumber Fusarium wilt by regulating the soil microbial community.

Myxobacteria are micropredators in the soil ecosystem with the capacity to move and feed cooperatively. Some myxobacterial strains have been used to control soil-borne fungal phytopathogens. However, interactions among myxobacteria, plant pathogens, and the soil microbiome are largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the behaviors of the myxobacterium Corallococcus sp. strain EGB in the soil and its effect on the soil microbiome after inoculation for controlling cucumber Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum (FOC).

## Heat-inactivated Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 (SYN-HI-001) in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
 11.04.2020, _V Andresen, J Gschossmann, P Layer_


Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75 is one of a few probiotic strains that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and its symptoms. Non-viable strains might have advantages over viable bacteria for product stability and standardisation, as well as for tolerability because safety concerns have been raised for specific patient groups who are susceptible to infection. We aimed to assess the efficacy of non-viable, heat-inactivated (HI) B bifidum MIMBb75 (SYN-HI-001) in the treatment of IBS and its symptoms.
