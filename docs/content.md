## The gut microbiota-brain axis in behaviour and brain disorders.
 18.03.2021, _LH Morais, HL Schreiber, SK Mazmanian_


In a striking display of trans-kingdom symbiosis, gut bacteria cooperate with their animal hosts to regulate the development and function of the immune, metabolic and nervous systems through dynamic bidirectional communication along the 'gut-brain axis'. These processes may affect human health, as certain animal behaviours appear to correlate with the composition of gut bacteria, and disruptions in microbial communities have been implicated in several neurological disorders. Most insights about host-microbiota interactions come from animal models, which represent crucial tools for studying the various pathways linking the gut and the brain. However, there are complexities and manifest limitations inherent in translating complex human disease to reductionist animal models. In this Review, we discuss emerging and exciting evidence of intricate and crucial connections between the gut microbiota and the brain involving multiple biological systems, and possible contributions by the gut microbiota to neurological disorders. Continued advances from this frontier of biomedicine may lead to tangible impacts on human health.

## Don't put all social network sites in one basket: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and their relations with well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 15.03.2021, _A Masciantonio, D Bourguignon, P Bouchat, M Balty, B Rimé_


Prior studies indicated that actively using social network sites (SNSs) is positively associated with well-being by enhancing social support and feelings of connectedness. Conversely, passively using SNSs is negatively associated with well-being by fostering upward social comparison and envy. However, the majority of these studies has focused on Facebook. The present research examined the relationships between well-being-satisfaction with life, negative affect, positive affect-and using actively or passively various SNSs-Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok-during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, two mediators were tested: social support and upward social comparison. One thousand four persons completed an online survey during the quarantine measures; the analyses employed structural equation modeling. Results showed that passive usage of Facebook is negatively related to well-being through upward social comparison, whereas active usage of Instagram is positively related to satisfaction with life and negative affect through social support. Furthermore, active usage of Twitter was positively related to satisfaction with life through social support; while passive usage was negatively related to upward social comparison, which, in turn, was associated with more negative affect. Finally, TikTok use was not associated with well-being. Results are discussed in line with SNSs' architectures and users' motivations. Future research is required to go beyond methodological and statistical limitations and allow generalization. This study concludes that SNSs must be differentiated to truly understand how they shape human interactions.
