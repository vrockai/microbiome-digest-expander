Gingivitis-the inflammation of the gums-is a reversible stage of periodontal disease. It is caused by dental plaque formation due to poor oral hygiene. However, gingivitis susceptibility involves a complex set of interactions between the oral microbiome, oral metabolome and the host. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of the oral microbiome and its interactions with the salivary metabolome during experimental gingivitis in a cohort of 41 systemically healthy participants. We use Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC), which is a multi-way generalization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that can model the variability in the response due to subjects, variables and time. Using the modelled responses, we identified microbial subcommunities with similar dynamics that connect to the magnitude of the gingivitis response. By performing high level integration of the predicted metabolic functions of the microbiome and salivary metabolome, we identified pathways of interest that describe the changing proportions of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microbiota, variation in anaerobic bacteria, biofilm formation and virulence.

## Establishing human microbial observatory programs in low- and middle-income countries.
 19.09.2024, _JI Gordon, MJ Barratt, MC Hibberd, M Rahman, T Ahmed_


Studies of the human microbiome are progressing rapidly but have largely focused on populations living in high-income countries. With increasing evidence that the microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases that affect infants, children, and adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and with profound and rapid ongoing changes occurring in our lifestyles and biosphere, understanding the origins of and developing microbiome-directed therapeutics for treating a number of global health challenges requires the development of programs for studying human microbial ecology in LMICs. Here, we discuss how the establishment of long-term human microbial observatory programs in selected LMICs could provide one timely approach.
