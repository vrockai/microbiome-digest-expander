## Programmed cell death as a black queen in microbial communities.
 30.11.2020, _A Ndhlovu, PM Durand, G Ramsey_


Programmed cell death (PCD) in unicellular organisms is in some instances an altruistic trait. When the beneficiaries are clones or close kin, kin selection theory may be used to explain the evolution of the trait, and when the trait evolves in groups of distantly related individuals, group or multilevel selection theory is invoked. In mixed microbial communities, the benefits are also available to unrelated taxa. But the evolutionary ecology of PCD in communities is poorly understood. Few hypotheses have been offered concerning the community role of PCD despite its far-reaching effects. The hypothesis we consider here is that PCD is a black queen. The Black Queen Hypothesis (BQH) outlines how public goods arising from a leaky function are exploited by other taxa in the community. Black Queen (BQ) traits are essential for community survival, but only some members bear the cost of possessing them, while others lose the trait In addition, BQ traits have been defined in terms of adaptive gene loss, and it is unknown whether this has occurred for PCD. Our conclusion is that PCD fulfills the two most important criteria of a BQ (leakiness and costliness), but that more empirical data are needed for assessing the remaining two criteria. In addition, we hold that for viewing PCD as a BQ, the original BQH needs to include social traits. Thus, despite some empirical and conceptual shortcomings, the BQH provides a helpful avenue for investigating PCD in microbial communities.

## The Pre-treatment Gut Microbiome is Associated with Lack of Response to Methotrexate in New Onset Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Although oral methotrexate (MTX) remains the anchor drug for RA, up to 50% of patients do not achieve a clinically adequate outcome. Concomitantly, there is a lack of prognostic tools for treatment response prior to drug initiation. Here we study whether inter-individual differences in the human gut microbiome can aid in the prediction of MTX efficacy in new-onset RA (NORA).

## Microbiome Analysis from Paired Mucosal and Fecal Samples of a Colorectal Cancer Biobank.

The role of gut microbiota in colorectal cancer is subject to extensive research. Before usage of biorepositories for microbiome studies, it is crucial to evaluate technical feasibility of microbiome profiling from various biospecimens. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of DNA-extraction and microbiome profiling of samples from different sample sites, tissue sites and storage duration of a colorectal cancer biobank. Mucosa samples, mucosal scrapings and feces as well as different tissue sites (tumor, normal mucosa) were analyzed. 16S rRNA gene-based microbiome profiling with taxonomic assignment was performed on the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, USA) platform from stored snap frozen samples. For statistical analysis, α- and β-diversity measures, PCoA, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and graphical representation were performed. Microbiome analysis could be successfully performed in most of the samples (overall 93.3%) with sufficient numbers of high-quality reads. There were no differences between sample sites, while in some measures significant differences were found between tumor and normal mucosa (α-diversity, Shannon/Simpson Indices p = 0.028/0.027, respectively). Samples stored for up to eight years were used and storage conditions had no significant influence on the results. Tumor and tissue samples of a biobank stored long term can be successfully used for microbiome analysis. As large sample sizes are needed for association studies to evaluate microbial impact on tumorigenesis or progression of colorectal cancer, an already established biorepository may be a useful alternative to prospective clinical studies.

## Not That Close to Mommy: Horizontal Transmission Seeds the Microbiome Associated with the Marine Sponge Plakina cyanorosea.

Marine sponges are excellent examples of invertebrate-microbe symbioses. In this holobiont, the partnership has elegantly evolved by either transmitting key microbial associates through the host germline and/or capturing microorganisms from the surrounding seawater. We report here on the prokaryotic microbiota during different developmental stages of Plakina cyanorosea and their surrounding environmental samples by a 16S rRNA metabarcoding approach. In comparison with their source adults, larvae housed slightly richer and more diverse microbial communities, which are structurally more related to the environmental microbiota. In addition to the thaumarchaeal Nitrosopumilus, parental sponges were broadly dominated by Alpha- and Gamma-proteobacteria, while the offspring were particularly enriched in the Vibrionales, Alteromonodales, Enterobacterales orders and the Clostridia and Bacteroidia classes. An enterobacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was the dominant member of the strict core microbiota. The most abundant and unique OTUs were not significantly enriched amongst the microbiomes from host specimens included in the sponge microbiome project. In a wider context, Oscarella and Plakina are the sponge genera with higher divergence in their associated microbiota compared to their Homoscleromorpha counterparts. Our results indicate that P. cyanorosea is a low microbial abundance sponge (LMA), which appears to heavily depend on the horizontal transmission of its microbial partners that likely help the sponge host in the adaptation to its habitat.

## Comparative Metagenomics of Palearctic and Neotropical Avian Cloacal Viromes Reveal Geographic Bias in Virus Discovery.

Our understanding about viruses carried by wild animals is still scarce. The viral diversity of wildlife may be best described with discovery-driven approaches to the study of viral diversity that broaden research efforts towards non-canonical hosts and remote geographic regions. Birds have been key organisms in the transmission of viruses causing important diseases, and wild birds are threatened by viral spillovers associated with human activities. However, our knowledge of the avian virome may be biased towards poultry and highly pathogenic diseases. We describe and compare the fecal virome of two passerine-dominated bird assemblages sampled in a remote Neotropical rainforest in French Guiana (Nouragues Natural Reserve) and a Mediterranean forest in central Spain (La Herrería). We used metagenomic data to quantify the degree of functional and genetic novelty of viruses recovered by examining if the similarity of the contigs we obtained to reference sequences differed between both locations. In general, contigs from Nouragues were significantly less similar to viruses in databases than contigs from La Herrería using Blastn but not for Blastx, suggesting that pristine regions harbor a yet unknown viral diversity with genetically more singular viruses than more studied areas. Additionally, we describe putative novel viruses of the families Picornaviridae, Reoviridae and Hepeviridae. These results highlight the importance of wild animals and remote regions as sources of novel viruses that substantially broaden the current knowledge of the global diversity of viruses.

In recent years, Lake Baikal has undergone significant changes in the composition of coastal communities associated with the increasing anthropogenic influence and global climate changes. In this context, we carried out metagenomic sequencing of the DNA viral community of an integral near-bottom water sample from the littoral zone of the lake.
