## Integrated metagenomic and metabolomic analysis reveals distinct gut-microbiome-derived phenotypes in early-onset colorectal cancer.
 11.08.2022, _C Kong, L Liang, G Liu, L Du, Y Yang, J Liu, D Shi, X Li, Y Ma_


The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC) is steadily increasing. Here, we aimed to characterise the interactions between gut microbiome, metabolites and microbial enzymes in EO-CRC patients and evaluate their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for EO-CRC.

Alterations in the vaginal bacterial flora reflect the status of various obstetric conditions and are associated with mechanisms that underlie certain pregnancy-associated complications. These changes are also a predictive biomarker for clinical outcomes of these adverse events.

## Ultra-processed foods and human health: from epidemiological evidence to mechanistic insights.
 11.08.2022, _B Srour, MC Kordahi, E Bonazzi, M Deschasaux-Tanguy, M Touvier, B Chassaing_


Epidemiological studies have suggested a role for ultra-processed foods in numerous chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic syndrome. Preclinical and clinical studies are accumulating to better decipher the effects of various aspects of food processing and formulation on the aetiology of chronic, debilitating inflammatory diseases. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current data that highlight an association between ultra-processed food consumption and various chronic diseases, with a focus on epidemiological evidence and mechanistic insights involving the intestinal microbiota.
