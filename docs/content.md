## Engineering microbial consortia for controllable outputs.
 02.12.2018, _SR Lindemann, HC Bernstein, HS Song, JK Fredrickson, MW Fields, W Shou, DR Johnson, AS Beliaev_


_Bioengineering, Genomics, Microbial Consortia_
Much research has been invested into engineering microorganisms to perform desired biotransformations; nonetheless, these efforts frequently fall short of expected results due to the unforeseen effects of biofeedback regulation and functional incompatibility. In nature, metabolic function is compartmentalized into diverse organisms assembled into robust consortia, in which the division of labor is thought to lead to increased community efficiency and productivity. Here we consider whether and how consortia can be designed to perform bioprocesses of interest beyond the metabolic flexibility limitations of a single organism. Advances in post-genomic analysis of microbial consortia and application of high-resolution global measurements now offer the promise of systems-level understanding of how microbial consortia adapt to changes in environmental variables and inputs of carbon and energy. We argue that, when combined with appropriate modeling frameworks, systems-level knowledge can markedly improve our ability to predict the fate and functioning of consortia. Here we articulate our collective perspective on the current and future state of microbial community engineering and control while placing specific emphasis on ecological principles that promote control over community function and emergent properties.

## Spatiotemporal dynamics during niche remodeling by super-colonizing microbiota in the mammalian gut.

While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to be effective in reversing gut dysbiosis, we lack an understanding of the fundamental processes underlying microbial engraftment in the mammalian gut. Here, we explored a murine gut colonization model leveraging natural inter-individual variations in gut microbiomes to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of FMT. We identified a natural "super-donor" consortium that robustly engrafts into diverse recipients and resists reciprocal colonization. Temporal profiling of the gut microbiome showed an ordered succession of rapid engraftment by early colonizers within 72 h, followed by a slower emergence of late colonizers over 15-30 days. Moreover, engraftment was localized to distinct compartments of the gastrointestinal tract in a species-specific manner. Spatial metagenomic characterization suggested engraftment was mediated by simultaneous transfer of spatially co-localizing species from the super-donor consortia. These results offer a mechanism of super-donor colonization by which nutritional niches are expanded in a spatiotemporally dependent manner. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

## Prevalence of postpartum depression and its association with diabetes mellitus among mothers in public health facilities in Mbarara, Southwestern Uganda.
 29.11.2024, _C Atuhaire, K Taseera, EC Atukunda, D Atwine, LT Matthews, GZ Rukundo_


Postpartum Depression (PPD) is a major health challenge with potentially devastating maternal and physical health outcomes. Development of diabetes mellitus has been hypothesized as one of the potential adverse effects of PPD among mothers in the postpartum period, but this association has not been adequately studied especially in low resource settings. This study aimed at determining prevalence of postpartum depression and its association with diabetes mellitus among mothers in Mbarara District, southwestern Uganda. We conducted a facility based cross-sectional study of 309 mothers between 6th week to 6th month after childbirth. Using proportionate stratified consecutive sampling, mothers were enrolled from postnatal clinics of two health facilities, Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital and Bwizibwera Health center IV. PPD was diagnosed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 7.0.2) for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed by measuring Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Logistic regression was used to determine the association of PPD and diabetes mellitus among mothers. The study established that PPD prevalence of PPD among mothers of 6th weeks to 6th months postpartum period in Mbarara was 40.5% (95% CI: 35.1-45.1%) and it was statistically significantly associated with diabetes mellitus in mothers between 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus among mothers with PPD was 28% compared to 13.6% among mothers without PPD. Mothers with PPD had 3 times higher odds of being newly diagnosed with diabetes as compared to those without PPD (aOR = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.62-5.74, p = 0.001). Mothers with PPD between 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum are more likely to have diabetes mellitus as compared to those without PPD. Well-designed prospective analytical studies are needed to conclude on the risk of diabetes mellitus in relation to PPD. Early screening of PPD may be considered in postpartum mothers.

The human gut microbiome is highly personal. However, the contribution of gut physiology and environment to variations in the gut microbiome remains understudied. Here we performed an observational trial using multi-omics to profile microbiome composition and metabolism in 61 healthy adults for 9 consecutive days. We assessed day-to-day changes in gut environmental factors and measured whole-gut and segmental intestinal transit time and pH using a wireless motility capsule in a subset of 50 individuals. We observed substantial daily fluctuations, with intra-individual variations in gut microbiome and metabolism associated with changes in stool moisture and faecal pH, and inter-individual variations accounted for by whole-gut and segmental transit times and pH. Metabolites derived from microbial carbohydrate fermentation correlated negatively with the gut passage time and pH, while proteolytic metabolites and breath methane showed a positive correlation. Finally, we identified associations between segmental transit time/pH and coffee-, diet-, host- and microbial-derived metabolites. Our work suggests that gut physiology and environment are key to understanding the individuality of the human gut microbial composition and metabolism.

## Stabilisation of a Strontium Hydride with a Monodentate Carbazolyl Ligand and its Reactivity.
 29.11.2024, _L Winkler, A Hinz_


The molecular strontium hydride 2[(dtbpCbz)SrH(L)]2 (L = benzene, toluene) was isolated and stabilized by employing a sterically demanding carbazole ligand (dtbpCbz = 1,8-bis(3,5-ditert-butyl-phenyl)-3,6-ditertbutylcarbazolyl). Compound 2 was synthesized via phenylsilane metathesis with the corresponding amide (dtbpCbz)SrN(SiMe3)2 and characterized by 1H NMR, XRD and vibrational spectroscopy methods. We further investigated the stoichiometric reactivity of 2 towards carbon monoxide, azobenzene and trimethylsilylacetylene, showing three distinct reactivity pathways: addition, reduction and deprotonation. The reaction of 2 with carbon monoxide yields the ethenediolate complex 4 via addition, while with azobenzene reduction of the N-N double bond and release of hydrogen were observed, affording a heteroleptic strontium complex with a radical azobenzenyl ligand (5). The terminal alkyne is deprotonated by the hydride moiety to give the acetylide complex 6.

## Gut microbiome strain-sharing within isolated village social networks.
 20.11.2024, _F Beghini, J Pullman, M Alexander, SV Shridhar, D Prinster, A Singh, R Matute JuÃ¡rez, EM Airoldi, IL Brito, NA Christakis_


When humans assemble into face-to-face social networks, they create an extended social environment that permits exposure to the microbiome of others, thereby shaping the composition and diversity of the microbiome at individual and population levels1-6. Here we use comprehensive social network mapping and detailed microbiome sequencing data in 1,787 adults within 18 isolated villages in Honduras7 to investigate the relationship between network structure and gut microbiome composition. Using both species-level and strain-level data, we show that microbial sharing occurs between many relationship types, notably including non-familial and non-household connections. Furthermore, strain-sharing extends to second-degree social connections, suggesting the relevance of a person's broader network. We also observe that socially central people are more microbially similar to the overall village than socially peripheral people. Among 301 people whose microbiome was re-measured 2 years later, we observe greater convergence in strain-sharing in connected versus otherwise similar unconnected co-villagers. Clusters of species and strains occur within clusters of people in village social networks, meaning that social networks provide the social niches within which microbiome biology and phenotypic impact are manifested.

A study was conducted in fish processing facilities to investigate the microbial composition, microbial metabolic potential, and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes. Whole metagenomic sequencing was used to analyze microbial communities from different processing rooms, operators and fish products. Taxonomic analyses identified the genera Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter as the most prevalent bacteria. A Principal Component Analysis revealed a distinct separation between fish product and environmental samples, as well as differences between fish product samples from companies processing either Gadidae or Salmonidae fish. Some particular bacterial genera and species were associated with specific processing rooms and operators. Metabolic analysis of metagenome assembled genomes demonstrated variations in microbiota metabolic profiles of microbiota across rooms and fish products. The study also examined the presence of antibiotic-resistance genes in fish processing environments, contributing to the understanding of microbial dynamics, metabolic potential, and implications for fish spoilage.

## Insights into respiratory microbiome composition and systemic inflammatory biomarkers of bronchiectasis patients.
 13.11.2024, _A Konovalovas, J ArmalytÄ—, L KlimkaitÄ—, T Liveikis, B JonaitytÄ—, E Danila, D BironaitÄ—, D MieliauskaitÄ—, E Bagdonas, R AldonytÄ—_


The human microbiomes, including the ones present in the respiratory tract, are described and characterized in an increasing number of studies. However, the composition and the impact of the healthy and/or impaired microbiome on pulmonary health and its interaction with the host tissues remain enigmatic. In chronic airway diseases, bronchiectasis stands out as a progressive condition characterized by microbial colonization and infection. In this study, we aimed to investigate the microbiome of the lower airways and lungs of bronchiectasis patients together with their serum cytokine and chemokine content, and gain novel insights into the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. The microbiome of 47 patients was analyzed by sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA gene using amplicon sequencing Oxford Nanopore technologies. Their serum inflammatory mediators content was quantified in parallel. Several divergently composed microbiome groups were identified and characterized, the majority of patients displayed one dominant bacterial species, whereas others had a more diverse microbiome. The analysis of systemic immune biomarkers revealed two distinct inflammatory response groups, i.e., low and high response groups, each associated with a specific array of clinical symptoms, microbial composition, and diversity. Moreover, we have identified some microbiome compositions associated with high inflammatory response, i.e., high levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, whereas other microbiomes were in correlation with low inflammatory responses. Although bronchiectasis pathogenetic mechanisms remain to be elucidated, it is clear that addressing microbiome composition in the airways is a valuable resource not only for diagnosis but also for personalized disease management.

## Urinary biochemical ecology reveals microbiome-metabolite interactions and metabolic markers of recurrent urinary tract infection.
 01.11.2024, _ML Neugent, NV Hulyalkar, D Ghosh, PE Zimmern, V Shulaev, NJ De Nisco_


Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are a major clinical challenge in postmenopausal women and their increasing prevalence underscores the need to define interactions between the host and the urinary microbiome that may underlie rUTI susceptibility. A body of work has identified the taxonomic profile of the female urinary microbiome associate with aging, menopause, and urinay disease. However, how this microbial community engages with the host niche, including the local biochemical environment of the urogenital tract, in health and disease is yet to be fully defined. This study directly assesses differences in the biochemical environment of the urine, or biochemical ecology, associated with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) and defines a microbe-metabolite association network of the female urinary microbiome. By integrating metagenomic and metabolomic data collected from a controlled cohort of women with rUTI, we find that distinct metabolites, such as methionine sulfoxide (Met-SO) and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), are associated with differences in urinary microbiome diversity. We observe associations between microbial and biochemical beta diversity and unique metabolic networks of uropathogenic Escherichia coli and uroprotective Lactobacillus species, highlighting potential metabolite-driven ecological shifts that may influence UTI susceptibility. We identify a urinary lipid signature of active rUTI that can accurately distinguish (AUC = 0.987) cases controls. Finally, using time-to-relapse data we identify deoxycholic acid (DCA) as a new prognostic indicator for rUTI recurrence. Together these findings suggest that systemic metabolic processes may influence susceptibility, opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention and the development of more accurate diagnostic and prognostic to improve patient outcomes.

## Distinct maternofetal immune signatures delineate preterm birth onset following urinary tract infection.
 27.11.2024, _S Ottinger, AB Larson, V Mercado-Evans, H Branthoover, JJ Zulk, C Serchejian, ME Mejia, ZA Hameed, R Walde, RC Fleck, AE Shea, KA Patras_


Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality resulting in over one million neonatal deaths annually. Maternal urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy increases risk for preterm birth; however, biological processes mediating UTI-associated preterm birth are not well-described. We established a murine maternal UTI model in which challenge with uropathogenic E. coli resulted in preterm birth in about half of dams. Dams experiencing preterm birth displayed excessive bladder inflammation and altered uteroplacental T cell polarization compared to non-laboring infected dams, with no differences in bacterial burdens. Additional factors associated with preterm birth included higher proportions of male fetuses and lower maternal serum IL-10. Furthermore, exogenous maternal IL-10 treatment absolved UTI-associated preterm birth but contributed to fetal growth restriction in this model. Using urine samples from a cohort of human pregnancies with or without UTI, we correlated urinary cytokines with birth outcomes and urine culture status. These analyses yielded a non-invasive, highly predictive three-model system for evaluating preterm birth risk implicating cytokines IL-10, IL-15, IL-1Î², and IL-1RA. Our unique bimodal murine model coupled with patient samples provides a platform to investigate immunological and microbial factors governing UTI-associated preterm birth, revealing novel therapeutic opportunities to predict or prevent preterm birth.

## Longitudinal genomic surveillance of a UK intensive care unit shows a lack of patient colonisation by multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.
 06.11.2024, _AE Snaith, RA Moran, RJ Hall, A Casey, L Ratcliffe, W van Schaik, T Whitehouse, A McNally_

Vulnerable patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting are at high risk of infection from bacteria including gut-colonising Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. Complex ICU procedures often depend on successful antimicrobial treatment, underscoring the importance of understanding the extent of patient colonisation by multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in large UK ICUs. Previous work on ICUs globally uncovered high rates of colonisation by transmission of MDROs, but the situation in UK ICUs is less understood. Here, we investigated the diversity and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) carriage of bacteria present in one of the largest UK ICUs at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB), focusing primarily on E. coli as both a widespread commensal and a globally disseminated multi-drug-resistant pathogen. Samples were taken during highly restrictive coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) control measures from May to December 2021. Whole-genome and metagenomic sequencing were used to detect and report strain-level colonisation of patients, focusing on E. coli sequence types (STs), their colonisation dynamics and antimicrobial resistance gene carriage. We found a lack of multi-drug resistance (MDR) in the QEHB. Only one carbapenemase-producing organism was isolated, a Citrobacter carrying bla KPC-2. There was no evidence supporting the spread of this strain, and there was little evidence overall of nosocomial acquisition or circulation of colonising E. coli. Whilst 22 different E. coli STs were identified, only 1 strain of the pandemic ST131 lineage was isolated. This ST131 strain was non-MDR and was found to be a clade A strain, associated with low levels of antibiotic resistance. Overall, the QEHB ICU had very low levels of pandemic or MDR strains, a result that may be influenced in part by the strict COVID-19 control measures in place at the time. Employing some of these infection prevention and control measures where reasonable in all ICUs might therefore assist in maintaining low levels of nosocomial MDR.
