HIV-1 infection is characterized by a massive depletion of mucosal CD4 T cells that triggers a cascade of events ultimately linking gut microbial dysbiosis to HIV-1 disease progression and pathogenesis. The association between HIV infection and the enteric virome composition is less characterized, although viruses are an essential component of the gut ecosystem. Here, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the fecal viral (eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages) and bacterial microbiome in people with HIV (PWH) and in HIV-negative individuals. To gain further insight into the association between the gut microbiome composition, HIV-associated immunodeficiency, and immune recovery, we carried out a longitudinal study including 14 PWH who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) and were followed for 24 months with samplings performed at baseline (before ART) and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months post-ART initiation.

## Vaginal lactobacilli produce anti-inflammatory β-carboline compounds.
 18.10.2024, _VJ Glick, CA Webber, LE Simmons, MC Martin, M Ahmad, CH Kim, AND Adams, S Bang, MC Chao, NC Howard, SM Fortune, M Verma, M Jost, LK Beura, MJ James, SY Lee, CM Mitchell, J Clardy, KH Kim, S Gopinath_


The optimal vaginal microbiome is a Lactobacillus-dominant community. Apart from Lactobacillus iners, the presence of Lactobacillus species is associated with reduced vaginal inflammation and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Loss of Lactobacillus-dominance is associated with inflammatory conditions, such as bacterial vaginosis (BV). We have identified that Lactobacillus crispatus, a key vaginal bacterial species, produces a family of β-carboline compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. These compounds suppress nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and interferon (IFN) signaling downstream of multiple pattern recognition receptors in primary human cells and significantly dampen type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) activation in monocytes. Topical application of an anti-inflammatory β-carboline compound, perlolyrine, was sufficient to significantly reduce vaginal inflammation in a mouse model of genital herpes infection. These compounds are enriched in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) of healthy people compared with people with BV. This study identifies a family of compounds by which vaginal lactobacilli mediate host immune homeostasis and highlights a potential therapeutic avenue for vaginal inflammation.

## Intestinal fungal-host interactions in promoting and maintaining health.
 10.10.2024, _JH Hill, JL Round_


_Humans, Fungi, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Animals, Host Microbial Interactions, Mycobiome, Intestines, Host-Pathogen Interactions_
The resident microbiota are a key component of a healthy organism. The vast majority of microbiome studies have focused on bacterial members, which constitute a significant portion of resident microbial biomass. Recent studies have demonstrated how the fungal component of the microbiota, or the mycobiome, influences mammalian biology despite its low abundance compared to other microbes. Fungi are known for their pathogenic potential, yet fungi are also prominent colonizers in healthy states, highlighting their duality. We summarize the characteristics that define the gut mycobiome across life, the factors that can impact its composition, and studies that identify mechanisms of how fungi confer health benefits. The goal of this review is to synthesize our knowledge regarding the composition and function of a healthy mycobiome with a view to inspiring future therapeutic advances.

## From gut to bone: deciphering the impact of gut microbiota on osteoporosis pathogenesis and management.
 11.10.2024, _L Hao, Y Yan, G Huang, H Li_


_Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Osteoporosis, Bone Density, Bone and Bones, Animals, Risk Factors_
Osteoporosis (OP) is characterized by decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk, poses a significant global health burden. Recent research has shed light on the bidirectional relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and bone health, presenting a novel avenue for understanding OP pathogenesis and developing targeted therapeutic interventions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the GM-bone axis, exploring the impact of GM on OP development and management. We elucidate established risk factors and pathogenesis of OP, delve into the diversity and functional changes of GM in OP. Furthermore, we examine experimental evidence and clinical observations linking alterations in GM composition or function with variations in BMD and fracture risk. Mechanistic insights into microbial mediators of bone health, such as microbial metabolites and products, are discussed. Therapeutic implications, including GM-targeted interventions and dietary strategies, are also explored. Finally, we identify future research directions and challenges in translating these findings into clinical practice.

To ensure sustainable aquaculture, it is essential to understand the path 'from feed to fish', whereby the gut microbiome plays an important role in digestion and metabolism, ultimately influencing host health and growth. Previous work has reported the taxonomic composition of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) gut microbiome; however, functional insights are lacking. Here we present the Salmon Microbial Genome Atlas consisting of 211 high-quality bacterial genomes, recovered by cultivation (n = 131) and gut metagenomics (n = 80) from wild and farmed fish both in freshwater and seawater. Bacterial genomes were taxonomically assigned to 14 different orders, including 35 distinctive genera and 29 previously undescribed species. Using metatranscriptomics, we functionally characterized key bacterial populations, across five phyla, in the salmon gut. This included the ability to degrade diet-derived fibres and release vitamins and other exometabolites with known beneficial effects, which was supported by genome-scale metabolic modelling and in vitro cultivation of selected bacterial species coupled with untargeted metabolomic studies. Together, the Salmon Microbial Genome Atlas provides a genomic and functional resource to enable future studies on salmon nutrition and health.

## Stress triggers irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea through a spermidine-mediated decline in type I interferon.
 04.10.2024, _L Zhang, HL Wang, YF Zhang, XT Mao, TT Wu, ZH Huang, WJ Jiang, KQ Fan, DD Liu, B Yang, MH Zhuang, GM Huang, Y Liang, SJ Zhu, JY Zhong, GY Xu, XM Li, Q Cao, YY Li, J Jin_


Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is a common and chronic gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by abdominal discomfort and occasional diarrhea. The pathogenesis of IBS-D is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including psychological stress, abnormal muscle contractions, and inflammation and disorder of the gut microbiome. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis of the logical regulatory correlation among these factors. In this study, we found that stress induced hyperproduction of xanthine and altered the abundance and metabolic characteristics of Lactobacillus murinus in the gut. Lactobacillus murinus-derived spermidine suppressed the basal expression of type I interferon (IFN)-α in plasmacytoid dendritic cells by inhibiting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3. The reduction in IFN-α unrestricted the contractile function of colonic smooth muscle cells, resulting in an increase in bowel movement. Our findings provided a theoretical basis for the pathological mechanism of, and new drug targets for, stress-exposed IBS-D.

Built environments (BEs) are typically considered to be oligotrophic and harsh environments for microbial communities under normal, non-damp conditions. However, the metabolic functions of microbial inhabitants in BEs remain poorly understood. This study aimed to shed light on the functional capabilities of microbes in BEs by analyzing 860 representative metagenome-assembled genomes (rMAGs) reconstructed from 738 samples collected from BEs across the city of Hong Kong and from the skin surfaces of human occupants. The study specifically focused on the metabolic functions of rMAGs that are either phylogenetically novel or prevalent in BEs.

Current metagenomic tools can fail to identify highly divergent RNA viruses. We developed a deep learning algorithm, termed LucaProt, to discover highly divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) sequences in 10,487 metatranscriptomes generated from diverse global ecosystems. LucaProt integrates both sequence and predicted structural information, enabling the accurate detection of RdRP sequences. Using this approach, we identified 161,979 potential RNA virus species and 180 RNA virus supergroups, including many previously poorly studied groups, as well as RNA virus genomes of exceptional length (up to 47,250 nucleotides) and genomic complexity. A subset of these novel RNA viruses was confirmed by RT-PCR and RNA/DNA sequencing. Newly discovered RNA viruses were present in diverse environments, including air, hot springs, and hydrothermal vents, with virus diversity and abundance varying substantially among ecosystems. This study advances virus discovery, highlights the scale of the virosphere, and provides computational tools to better document the global RNA virome.

## SurvBal: Compositional microbiome balances for survival outcomes.
 15.10.2024, _Y Li, T Lee, K Marin, X Hua, S Srinivasan, DN Fredricks, JR Lee, W Ling_


Identification of balances of bacterial taxa in relation to continuous and dichotomous outcomes is an increasingly frequent analytic objective in microbiome profiling experiments. SurvBal enables the selection of balances in relation to censored survival or time-to-event outcomes which are of considerable interest in many biomedical studies. The most commonly used survival models-the Cox proportional hazards and parametric survival models are included in the package, which are used in combination with step-wise selection procedures to identify the optimal associated balance of microbiome, i.e., the ratio of the geometric means of two groups of taxa's relative abundances.

## q2-metnet: QIIME2 package to analyze 16S rRNA data via high-quality metabolic reconstructions of the human gut microbiota.
 17.07.2024, _F Balzerani, T Blasco, S Pérez-Burillo, MP Francino, JÁ Rufián-Henares, L Valcarcel, FJ Planes_


16S rRNA gene sequencing is the most frequent approach for the characterization of the human gut microbiota. Despite different efforts in the literature, the inference of functional and metabolic interpretations from 16S rRNA gene sequencing data is still a challenging task. High-quality metabolic reconstructions of the human gut microbiota, such as AGORA and AGREDA, constitute a curated resource to improve functional inference from 16S rRNA data, but they are not typically integrated into standard bioinformatics tools.
