Antheraea mylitta, the Tropical tasar silkworm, is frequently affected by a vomiting disease called Virosis by sericulturists although not confirmed being of viral origin. Based on the symptoms and the disease pattern, the causal agent is however suspected to be a virus. The condition involves a series of characteristic and progressive symptoms that generally culminates in the death of the larva. The disease is common in autumn season (Sep- Oct), with widespread distribution causing severe damage to the tasar silkworm industry. The leads for this study were obtained from a transcript identified in the EST database in a different study, which matched the positive strand of Iflavirus, an RNA virus known to infect insects. In the present study the genome of this novel Iflavirus was characterised and the full length of the genome was found to be 9728 nucleotides long encoding for a single large open reading frame (ORF) with flanking NTR regions at 5' and 3' ends and a natural poly A tail at the 3' end. The ORF encoded structural proteins at the N-terminal end and non-structural proteins at the C-terminal end with a predicted 2967 amino acid long polyprotein. The structural proteins consisted of 4 proteins (VP1-VP4) and the non-structural proteins consisted of helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and 3C-protease. The virus is found in various tissues (midgut, fatbody, trachea, Malpighian tubules and silk gland) and also has a vertical route of transmission, i.e., from gravid females to the offspring. Based on the available data, the virus is a new member of Iflaviridae for which we propose the name Antheraea mylitta Iflavirus (AmIV).

## 'A landmark in psychiatric progress'? The role of evidence in the rise and fall of insulin coma therapy.
 22.12.2021, _R Freudenthal, J Moncrieff_


This paper examines the evidence behind the use and decline of insulin coma therapy as a treatment for schizophrenia and how this was viewed by the psychiatric profession. The paper demonstrates that, from the time of its introduction, there was considerable debate regarding the evidence for insulin treatment, and scepticism about its purported benefits. The randomized trials conducted in the 1950s were the result, rather than the origins, of this debate. Although insulin treatment was subsequently abandoned, it was still regarded as a historic moment in the modernization of psychiatry. Then, as now, evidence does not speak for itself, and insulin continued to be incorporated into the story of psychiatric progress even after it was shown to be ineffective.

## Excessive daytime sleepiness: an emerging marker of cardiovascular risk.
 01.02.2022, _J Bock, N Covassin, V Somers_


Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is classically viewed as a consequence of insufficient sleep or a symptom of sleep disorders. Epidemiological and clinical evidence have shown that patients reporting EDS in tandem with sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnoea) are at greater cardiovascular risk than non-sleepy patients. While this may simply be attributable to EDS being present in patients with a more severe condition, treatment of sleep disorders does not consistently alleviate EDS, indicating potential aetiological differences. Moreover, not all patients with sleep disorders report EDS, and daytime sleepiness may be present even in the absence of any identifiable sleep disorder; thus, EDS could represent an independent pathophysiology. The purpose of this review is twofold: first, to highlight evidence that EDS increases cardiovascular risk in the presence of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnoea, narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia and second, to propose the notion that EDS may also increase cardiovascular risk in the absence of known sleep disorders, as supported by some epidemiological and observational data. We further highlight preliminary evidence suggesting systemic inflammation, which could be attributable to dysfunction of the gut microbiome and adipose tissue, as well as deleterious epigenetic changes, may promote EDS while also increasing cardiovascular risk; however, these pathways may be reciprocal and/or circumstantial. Additionally, gaps within the literature are noted followed by directions for future research.

## Mechanism of Dyspnea during Exercise in Children with Corrected Congenital Heart Disease.
 24.01.2022, _M Chlif, MM Ammar, NB Said, L Sergey, S Ahmaidi, F Alassery, H Hamam_


_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Outcomes of lung transplantation from organ donation after medical assistance in dying: First North American experience.
 02.02.2022, _T Watanabe, M Kawashima, M Kohno, J Yeung, J Downar, A Healey, T Martinu, M Aversa, L Donahoe, A Pierre, M de Perrot, K Yasufuku, TK Waddell, S Keshavjee, M Cypel_


Over 2.5% of deaths in Canada occur as a result from Medical Assisting in Dying (MAID), and a subset of these deaths result in organ donation. However, detailed outcomes of lung transplant recipients using these donors is lacking. This is a retrospective single center cohort study comparing lung transplantation outcomes after donation using MAID donors compared to neurologically determined death and controlled donation after circulatory death (NDD/cDCD) donors from February 2018 to July 2021. Thirty-three patients received lungs from MAID donors, and 560 patients received lungs from NDD/cDCD donors. The donor diagnoses leading to MAID provision were: degenerative neurological diseases (n=33), and end stage organ failure (n=5). MAID donors were significantly older than NDD/cDCD donors [56 (IQR 49-64) years vs. 48 (32-59); P = .0009]. Median ventilation period and 30 days mortality were not significantly different between MAID and NDD/cDCD lungs recipients (ventilation: 1 day (1-3) vs 2 days (1-3); p=.37, deaths 0% (0/33) vs. 2% (11/560), p=.99 respectively). Intermediate-term outcomes were also similar. In summary, lung transplantation using donors after MAID, recipient outcomes are excellent. Therefore, where this practice is permitted, donation after MAID should be strongly considered for lung transplantation as a way to respect donor wishes while substantially improving outcomes for recipients with end-stage lung disease.
