Cells of most bacterial species are around 2 micrometers in length, with some of the largest specimens reaching 750 micrometers. Using fluorescence, x-ray, and electron microscopy in conjunction with genome sequencing, we characterized Candidatus (Ca.) Thiomargarita magnifica, a bacterium that has an average cell length greater than 9000 micrometers and is visible to the naked eye. These cells grow orders of magnitude over theoretical limits for bacterial cell size, display unprecedented polyploidy of more than half a million copies of a very large genome, and undergo a dimorphic life cycle with asymmetric segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells. These features, along with compartmentalization of genomic material and ribosomes in translationally active organelles bound by bioenergetic membranes, indicate gain of complexity in the Thiomargarita lineage and challenge traditional concepts of bacterial cells.

## Filamentous bacteriophage delays healing of Pseudomonas-infected wounds.
 22.06.2022, _MS Bach, CR de Vries, A Khosravi, JM Sweere, MC Popescu, Q Chen, S Demirdjian, A Hargil, JD Van Belleghem, G Kaber, M Hajfathalian, EB Burgener, D Liu, QL Tran, T Dharmaraj, M Birukova, V Sunkari, S Balaji, N Ghosh, SS Mathew-Steiner, MS El Masry, SG Keswani, N Banaei, L Nedelec, CK Sen, V Chandra, PR Secor, GA Suh, PL Bollyky_


Chronic wounds infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) are characterized by disease progression and increased mortality. We reveal Pf, a bacteriophage produced by Pa that delays healing of chronically infected wounds in human subjects and animal models of disease. Interestingly, impairment of wound closure by Pf is independent of its effects on Pa pathogenesis. Rather, Pf impedes keratinocyte migration, which is essential for wound healing, through direct inhibition of CXCL1 signaling. In support of these findings, a prospective cohort study of 36 human patients with chronic Pa wound infections reveals that wounds infected with Pf-positive strains of Pa are more likely to progress in size compared with wounds infected with Pf-negative strains. Together, these data implicate Pf phage in the delayed wound healing associated with Pa infection through direct manipulation of mammalian cells. These findings suggest Pf may have potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in chronic wounds.

## The pediatric virome in health and disease.
 18.05.2022, _G Liang, H Gao, FD Bushman_


_Child, Diarrhea, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Humans, Microbiota, Virome, Viruses_
Associations between the global microbiome and diseases of children have been studied extensively; however, research on the viral component of the microbiome, the "virome," is less advanced. The analysis of disease associations with the virome is often technically challenging, requiring a close examination of the "virome dark matter." The gut is a particularly rich source of viral particles, and now multiple studies have reported intriguing associations of the virome with childhood diseases. For example, virome studies have elucidated new lineages of gut viruses that appear to be tightly associated with childhood diarrhea, and consistent patterns are starting to emerge from virome studies in pediatric IBD. In this review, we summarize the methods for studying the virome and recent research on the nature of the virome during childhood, focusing on specific studies of the intestinal virome in pediatric diseases.

## Presence of Blastocystis in gut microbiota is associated with cognitive traits and decreased executive function.
 21.06.2022, _J Mayneris-Perxachs, M Arnoriaga-Rodríguez, J Garre-Olmo, J Puig, R Ramos, M Trelis, A Burokas, C Coll, C Zapata-Tona, S Pedraza, V Pérez-Brocal, L Ramió, W Ricart, A Moya, M Jové, J Sol, M Portero-Otin, R Pamplona, R Maldonado, JM Fernández-Real_


Growing evidence implicates the gut microbiome in cognition. Blastocystis is a common gut single-cell eukaryote parasite frequently detected in humans but its potential involvement in human pathophysiology has been poorly characterized. Here we describe how the presence of Blastocystis in the gut microbiome was associated with deficits in executive function and altered gut bacterial composition in a discovery (n = 114) and replication cohorts (n = 942). We also found that Blastocystis was linked to bacterial functions related to aromatic amino acids metabolism and folate-mediated pyrimidine and one-carbon metabolism. Blastocystis-associated shifts in bacterial functionality translated into the circulating metabolome. Finally, we evaluated the effects of microbiota transplantation. Donor's Blastocystis subtypes led to altered recipient's mice cognitive function and prefrontal cortex gene expression. In summary, Blastocystis warrant further consideration as a novel actor in the gut microbiome-brain axis.

## Altered mycobiota signatures and enriched pathogenic Aspergillus rambellii are associated with colorectal cancer based on multi-cohort fecal metagenomic analyses.

Enteric mycobiota is a major component of human gut microbiota, but its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains largely elusive. We conducted a meta-analysis to uncover the contribution of fungal mycobiota to CRC.

## Small molecules in the big picture of gut microbiome-host cross-talk.
 24.06.2022, _Y Ma, X Liu, J Wang_


Research on the gut microbiome and related diseases is rapidly growing with the development of sequencing technologies. An increasing number of studies offer new perspectives on disease development or treatment. Among these, the mechanisms of gut microbial metabolite-mediated effects merit better understanding. In this review, we first summarize the shifts in gut microbial metabolites within complex diseases, in which metabolites have correlational and occasionally causal effects on diseases and discuss the reported mechanisms. We further investigate the interactions between gut microbes and drugs, providing insights for precision medication as well as limitations of current research. Finally, we provide new research directions and research strategies for the development of drugs from gut microbial metabolites. FUNDING STATEMENT: None.

## Maternal gut microbiome-induced IgG regulates neonatal gut microbiome and immunity.
 14.06.2022, _KZ Sanidad, M Amir, A Ananthanarayanan, A Singaraju, NB Shiland, HS Hong, N Kamada, N Inohara, G Núñez, MY Zeng_

The gut microbiome elicits antigen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) at steady state that cross-reacts to pathogens to confer protection against systemic infection. The role of gut microbiome-specific IgG antibodies in the development of the gut microbiome and immunity against enteric pathogens in early life, however, remains largely undefined. In this study, we show that gut microbiome-induced maternal IgG is transferred to the neonatal intestine through maternal milk via the neonatal Fc receptor and directly inhibits Citrobacter rodentium colonization and attachment to the mucosa. Enhanced neonatal immunity against oral C. rodentium infection was observed after maternal immunization with a gut microbiome-derived IgG antigen, outer membrane protein A, or induction of IgG-inducing gut bacteria. Furthermore, by generating a gene-targeted mouse model with complete IgG deficiency, we demonstrate that IgG knockout neonates are more susceptible to C. rodentium infection and exhibit alterations of the gut microbiome that promote differentiation of interleukin-17A-producing γδ T cells in the intestine, which persist into adulthood and contribute to increased disease severity in a dextran sulfate sodium-induced mouse model of colitis. Together, our studies have defined a critical role for maternal gut microbiome-specific IgG antibodies in promoting immunity against enteric pathogens and shaping the development of the gut microbiome and immune cells in early life.

## Time for better time-restricted eating trials to lessen the burden of metabolic diseases.
 22.06.2022, _PR Taub, S Panda_


Optimizing the quality, quantity, and timing of nutrition holds immense potential to improve health and prevent disease. The results of a recent randomized controlled trial1 have been widely misrepresented with the incorrect interpretation that optimizing the timing of food intake imparts no health benefits.
