Alterations to the natural microbiome are linked to different diseases, and the presence or absence of specific microbes is directly related to disease outcomes. We performed a comprehensive analysis with unique cohorts of the four subtypes of breast cancer (BC) characterized by their microbial signatures, using a pan-pathogen microarray strategy. The signature (includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites) of each tumor subtype was correlated with clinical data to identify microbes with prognostic potential. The subtypes of BC had specific viromes and microbiomes, with ER+ and TN tumors showing the most and least diverse microbiome, respectively. The specific microbial signatures allowed discrimination between different BC subtypes. Furthermore, we demonstrated correlations between the presence and absence of specific microbes in BC subtypes with the clinical outcomes. This study provides a comprehensive map of the oncobiome of BC subtypes, with insights into disease prognosis that can be critical for precision therapeutic intervention strategies.

The vaginal microbiota (VMB) are the set of microorganisms residing in the human vagina. During pregnancy, their composition is Lactobacillus-dominant in most Caucasian women. Previous studies suggest that the VMB of women with African ancestry is more likely to be non-Lactobacillus dominant (dysbiotic) compared to other populations, and possibly relate to the high incidence of pregnancy complications, such as preterm birth. This work reviewed the literature on VMB composition in pregnant women from sub-Saharan Africa.

## Aberrant gut-microbiota-immune-brain axis development in premature neonates with brain damage.

Premature infants are at substantial risk for suffering from perinatal white matter injury. Though the gut microbiota has been implicated in early-life development, a detailed understanding of the gut-microbiota-immune-brain axis in premature neonates is lacking. Here, we profiled the gut microbiota, immunological, and neurophysiological development of 60 extremely premature infants, which received standard hospital care including antibiotics and probiotics. We found that maturation of electrocortical activity is suppressed in infants with severe brain damage. This is accompanied by elevated γδ T cell levels and increased T cell secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and reduced secretion of neuroprotectants. Notably, Klebsiella overgrowth in the gut is highly predictive for brain damage and is associated with a pro-inflammatory immunological tone. These results suggest that aberrant development of the gut-microbiota-immune-brain axis may drive or exacerbate brain injury in extremely premature neonates and represents a promising target for novel intervention strategies.

## The effects of periodontitis associated microbiota on the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma.
 05.09.2021, _X Hu, X Shen, J Tian_


Epidemiological data have shown that periodontal bacterial infection, periodontitis, and oral squamous cell carcinoma have close relationship on the disease progress and risk. However, the specific role of periodontal microbes and their mechanism in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma is not yet clear. In our previous work, metagenomic Illumina Mi-seq analysis was used to identify tstructure and abundance of periodontital microbiome. Accoding to the results, we used Porphyromonas.spp. and Fusobacterium.spp. as the periodontitis positive microbiota; Neisseria.spp and Corynebacterium.spp as periodontitis negative microbiota (their average relative abundance were &gt;5%). These representative strains of the above genus were used to infect OSCC cells to explore their effect on tumor cell biology behavior, and detect the expression level of the gene in related to inflammation, migration, invasion and cell cycle. We find that periodontitis positive correlated microbiota had a promoting effect on the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma in vitro by regulating mRNA and protein expression of IL-6, IL-8, MMP-9 and Cyclin-D1. Periodontitis negative correlated microbiota had suppression effect on the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma in vitro analysis.

## Parasites and diet as main drivers of the Malagasy gut microbiome richness and function.

Interactions between the prokaryotic microbiome and eukaryotic parasites in the vertebrate gut may affect overall host health and disease. While intertropical areas exhibit a high rate of parasites carriers, such interactions are understudied in these populations. Our objectives were to (1) describe the gut microbiome of individuals living in Madagascar, (2) identify potential associations between bacterial taxa and parasites colonizing the digestive tract and (3) highlight main determinants of the gut microbiota composition in this developing country. Metadata (socioeconomic, diet, clinical) and fecal samples were collected from 219 volunteers from North-West Madagascar (Mahajanga). Fecal microbiome was assessed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics, and related to dietary habits and parasites carriage. We highlight important Malagasy gut microbiome peculiarities. Out of three detected enterotypes, only one is similar to that observed in Westernized countries (Ruminococcus-driven). Functions associated with the two others (Clostridium sensu stricto-driven and Escherichia/Shigella-driven) are mostly directed toward amino acids biosynthesis and degradation, respectively. Diet and protozoan carriage were the main drivers of microbiota composition. High protozoan carriage was associated with higher diversity, richness and microbial functionalities. The gut microbiome of Malagasy strongly differs from that of Westernized countries. Asymptomatic protozoan carriage and dietary habits are the external factors with the deepest impact on gut microbiome. Further studies are needed to understand whether gut microbial richness constitute a predilection niche for protozoans colonization, due to their gazing features, or whether the parasites themselves induce a higher bacterial richness.

## Thymic development of gut-microbiota-specific T cells.

Humans and their microbiota have coevolved a mutually beneficial relationship in which the human host provides a hospitable environment for the microorganisms and the microbiota provides many advantages for the host, including nutritional benefits and protection from pathogen infection1. Maintaining this relationship requires a careful immune balance to contain commensal microorganisms within the lumen while limiting inflammatory anti-commensal responses1,2. Antigen-specific recognition of intestinal microorganisms by T cells has previously been described3,4. Although the local environment shapes the differentiation of effector cells3-5 it is unclear how microbiota-specific T cells are educated in the thymus. Here we show that intestinal colonization in early life leads to the trafficking of microbial antigens from the intestine to the thymus by intestinal dendritic cells, which then induce the expansion of microbiota-specific T cells. Once in the periphery, microbiota-specific T cells have pathogenic potential or can protect against related pathogens. In this way, the developing microbiota shapes and expands the thymic and peripheral T cell repertoire, allowing for enhanced recognition of intestinal microorganisms and pathogens.

## Sex-dependent effects on the gut microbiota and host metabolome in type 1 diabetic mice.

Sexual dimorphism exists in the onset and development of type 1 diabetes (T1D), but its potential pathological mechanism is poorly understood. In the present study, we examined sex-specific changes in the gut microbiome and host metabolome of T1D mice via 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics approach, and aimed to investigate potential mechanism of the gut microbiota-host metabolic interaction in the sexual dimorphism of T1D. Our results demonstrate that female mice had a greater shift in the gut microbiota than male mice during the development of T1D; however, host metabolome was more susceptible to T1D in male mice. The correlation network analysis indicates that T1D-induced host metabolic changes may be regulated by the gut microbiota in a sex-specific manner, mainly involving short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) metabolism, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and choline metabolism. Therefore, our study suggests that sex-dependent "gut microbiota-host metabolism axis" may be implicated in the sexual dimorphism of T1D, and the link between microbes and metabolites might contribute to the prevention and treatment of T1D.

## Efficient computation of Faith's phylogenetic diversity with applications in characterizing microbiomes.

The number of publicly available microbiome samples is continually growing. As dataset size increases, bottlenecks arise in standard analytical pipelines. Faith's phylogenetic diversity is a highly utilized phylogenetic alpha diversity metric that has thus far failed to effectively scale to trees with millions of vertices. Stacked Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity (SFPhD) enables calculation of this widely adopted diversity metric at a much larger scale by implementing a computationally efficient algorithm. The algorithm reduces the amount of computational resources required, resulting in more accessible software with a reduced carbon footprint, as compared to previous approaches. The new algorithm produces identical results to the previous method. We further demonstrate that the phylogenetic aspect of Faith's PD provides increased power in detecting diversity differences between younger and older populations in the FINRISK study's metagenomic data.
