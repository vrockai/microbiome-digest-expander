 11.12.2020, _EN Baruch, I Youngster, G Ben-Betzalel, R Ortenberg, A Lahat, L Katz, K Adler, D Dick-Necula, S Raskin, N Bloch, D Rotin, L Anafi, C Avivi, J Melnichenko, Y Steinberg-Silman, R Mamtani, H Harati, N Asher, R Shapira-Frommer, T Brosh-Nissimov, Y Eshet, S Ben-Simon, O Ziv, MAW Khan, M Amit, NJ Ajami, I Barshack, J Schachter, JA Wargo, O Koren, G Markel, B Boursi_


The gut microbiome has been shown to influence the response of tumors to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in pre-clinical mouse models and observational patient cohorts. However, modulation of gut microbiota in cancer patients has not been investigated in clinical trials. Here we performed a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety and feasibility of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and re-induction of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in ten patients with anti-PD-1-refractory metastatic melanoma. We observed clinical responses in three patients, including two partial responses and one complete response. Notably, treatment with FMT was associated with favorable changes in immune cell infiltrates and gene expression profiles in both the gut lamina propria and the tumor microenvironment. Together, these early findings have important implications for modulating the gut microbiota in cancer treatment.

## Utilizing microbiome approaches to assist source tracking, treatment and prevention of COVID-19: Review and assessment.
 12.12.2020, _M Han, Y Zha, H Chong, C Zhong, K Ning_


COVID-19 has been one of the most serious infectious diseases since the end of 2019. However, the original source, as well as the treatment and prevention of causative agent of COVID-19 (namely SARS-CoV-2) are still unclear nearly a year after its publicly report. The microbiome approach, which has emerged in recent years focusing on human-related microbes, has become one of the promising avenues for source tracking, treatment, and prevention of a variety of infectious diseases including COVID-19. In this review, we summarized the microbiome approach as a supplementary approach for source tracking, treatment, and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We first provided background information on SARS-CoV-2 and microbiome approaches. Then we illustrated current strategies of microbiome methods to assist three aspects of COVID-19 research, namely source tracking, treatment, and prevention, respectively. Finally, we summarized the microbiome approaches and provided perspectives for future studies on faster and more effective SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and pathogenesis based on microbiome approaches.

## Microbiota Transplant in the Treatment of Obesity and Diabetes: Current and Future Perspectives.
 12.12.2020, _M Napolitano, M Covasa_


A wealth of evidence has revealed the critical role of the gut microbiota in health and disease. Many chronic diseases have been associated with gut microbiota imbalance in its composition, diversity and functional capacity. Several types of interventions have been shown to correct microbiota imbalance and restore the beneficial metabolic outcomes of a normal microbiota. Among them, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an emergent, promising technology employed to improve clinical outcomes of various pathological conditions through modifications in the gut microbiota composition. FMT has been used successfully as a treatment option in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, a condition characterized by severe gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, the potential usage of FMT in other microbiota-associated conditions different from C. difficile such as metabolic syndrome or obesity that are also marked by gut dysbiosis is still under investigation. Furthermore, the contribution of the gut microbiota as a cause or consequence in metabolic disease is still largely debated. This review provides critical information on the methodological approaches of FMT and its technological innovation in clinical applications. This review sheds light on the current findings and gaps in our understanding of how FMT can be used as a future biotherapeutic to restore microbial homeostasis in amelioration of obesity and diabetes.

## The potential role of vitamin D supplementation as a gut microbiota modifier in healthy individuals.
 11.12.2020, _P Singh, A Rawat, M Alwakeel, E Sharif, S Al Khodor_


Vitamin D deficiency affects approximately 80% of individuals in some countries and has been linked with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. While the benefits of vitamin D supplementation on the gut microbiota have been studied in patients with chronic diseases, its effects on the microbiota of otherwise healthy individuals is unclear. Moreover, whether effects on the microbiota can explain some of the marked inter-individual variation in responsiveness to vitamin D supplementation is unknown. Here, we administered vitamin D to 80 otherwise healthy vitamin D-deficient women, measuring serum 25(OH) D levels in blood and characterizing their gut microbiota pre- and post- supplementation using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Vitamin D supplementation significantly increased gut microbial diversity. Specifically, the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio increased, along with the abundance of the health-promoting probiotic taxa Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium. Significant variations in the two-dominant genera, Bacteroides and Prevotella, indicated a variation in enterotypes following supplementation. Comparing supplementation responders and non-responders we found more pronounced changes in abundance of major phyla in responders, and a significant decrease in Bacteroides acidifaciens in non-responders. Altogether, our study highlights the positive impact of vitamin D supplementation on the gut microbiota and the potential for the microbial gut signature to affect vitamin D response.

## Gene Networks Underlying the Resistance of Bifidobacterium longum to Inflammatory Factors.
 12.12.2020, _VA Veselovsky, MS Dyachkova, EA Menyaylo, PS Polyaeva, EI Olekhnovich, EA Shitikov, DA Bespiatykh, TA Semashko, AS Kasianov, EN Ilina, VN Danilenko, KM Klimina_


As permanent residents of the normal gut microbiota, bifidobacteria have evolved to adapt to the host's immune response whose priority is to eliminate pathogenic agents. The mechanisms that ensure the survival of commensals during inflammation and maintain the stability of the core component of the normal gut microbiota in such conditions remain poorly understood. We propose a new in vitro approach to study the mechanisms of resistance to immune response factors based on high-throughput sequencing followed by transcriptome analysis. This approach allowed us to detect differentially expressed genes associated with inflammation. In this study, we demonstrated that the presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα to the growth medium of the B. longum subsp. longum GT15 strain changes the latter's growth rate insignificantly while affecting the expression of certain genes. We identified these genes and performed a COG and a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Using phylogenetic profiling we predicted the operons of genes whose expression was triggered by the cytokines TNFα and IL-6 in vitro. By mapping the transcription start points, we experimentally validated the predicted operons. Thus, in this study, we predicted the genes involved in a putative signaling pathway underlying the mechanisms of resistance to inflammatory factors in bifidobacteria. Since bifidobacteria are a major component of the human intestinal microbiota exhibiting pronounced anti-inflammatory properties, this study is of great practical and scientific relevance.

## Microbiome dysbiosis in lung cancer: from composition to therapy.
 11.12.2020, _NN Liu, Q Ma, Y Ge, CX Yi, LQ Wei, JC Tan, Q Chu, JQ Li, P Zhang, H Wang_


The correlations between microbiota dysbiosis and cancer have gained extensive attention and been widely explored. As a leading cancer diagnosis worldwide, lung cancer poses a great threat to human health. The healthy human lungs are consistently exposed to external environment and harbor a specific pattern of microbiota, sharing many key pathological and physiological characteristics with the intestinal tract. Although previous findings uncovered the critical roles of microbiota in tumorigenesis and response to anticancer therapy, most of them were focused on the intestinal microbiota rather than lung microbiota. Notably, the considerable functions of microbiota in maintaining lung homeostasis should not be neglected as the microbiome dysbiosis may promote tumor development and progression through production of cytokines and toxins and multiple other pathways. Despite the fact that increasing studies have revealed the effect of microbiome on the induction of lung cancer and different disease status, the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies remained unclear. Herein, we summarized the recent progresses about microbiome in lung cancer and further discussed the role of microbial communities in promoting lung cancer progression and the current status of therapeutic approaches targeting microbiome to alleviate and even cure lung cancer.

## Bacterial and fungal profiles as markers of infliximab drug response in inflammatory bowel disease.
 10.12.2020, _R Ventin-Holmberg, A Eberl, S Saqib, K Korpela, S Virtanen, T Sipponen, A Salonen, P Saavalainen, E Nissilä_


Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are globally increasing chronic gastro-intestinal inflammatory disorders associating with altered gut microbiota. Infliximab (IFX), a TNF-alpha blocker, is used to treat IBD patients successfully though one third of the patients do not respond to therapy. No reliable biomarkers are available for prediction of IFX response.

## Low FODMAP Diet for Functional Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Quiescent Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.
 02.12.2020, _MG Grammatikopoulou, DG Goulis, K Gkiouras, MP Nigdelis, ST Papageorgiou, T Papamitsou, A Forbes, DP Bogdanos_


A low FODMAP diet (LFD) has been hypothesized to relieve symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The aim of the study was to systematically review the literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of the LFD in patients with IBD and FGD. Four databases were searched, but a meta-analysis was not performed due to methodological and outcomes heterogeneity. Four RCTs fulfilled the criteria, with three having some concerns in their risk of bias assessment. All interventions compared the LFDs against a "typical" or sham diet, spanning in duration from 21 days to 6 weeks. Quality of life was improved in two RCTs, while revealing inconsistent findings in the third trial, based on different assessment tools. The fecal assays revealed non-significant findings for most variables (fecal weight, pH, water content, gene count, and gut transit time) and inconsistent findings concerning stool frequency and short-chain fatty acids concentration. Levels of fecal calprotectin, CRP, or T-cell phenotype did not differ between intervention and comparator arms. Two RCTs reported a reduction in abdominal pain, while results concerning pain duration and bloating were inconsistent. In one trial, energy intake was considerably reduced among LFD participants. Regarding gut microbiota, no differences were noted. A considerable degree of methodological and outcome heterogeneity was observed, paired with results inconsistency. The available data are not sufficient to justify the claim that an LFD induces relief of FGD symptoms, although it may pave the way to a placebo response.

## Gut Microbiomes Differ Among Dietary Types and Stool Consistency in the Captive Red Wolf (Canis rufus).
 12.12.2020, _M Bragg, EW Freeman, HC Lim, N Songsasen, CR Muletz-Wolz_


Captive management of many wildlife species can be challenging, with individuals displaying health disorders that are not generally described in the wild population. Retrospective studies have identified gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, in particular inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as the second leading cause of captive adult red wolf (Canis rufus) mortality. Recent molecular studies show that imbalanced gut microbial composition is tightly linked to IBD in the domestic dog. The goal of the present study was to address two main questions: (1) how do red wolf gut microbiomes differ between animals with loose stool consistency, indicative of GI issues, and those with normal stool consistency and (2) how does dietary type relate to stool consistency and red wolf gut microbiomes? Fresh fecal samples were collected from 48 captive wolves housed in eight facilities in the United States and from two wild wolves living in Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, NC, United States. For each individual, the stool consistency was categorized as loose or normal using a standardized protocol and their diet was categorized as either wild, whole meat, a mix of whole meat and kibble or kibble. We characterized gut microbiome structure using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We found that red wolves with a loose stool consistency differed in composition than wolves with normal stool consistency, suggesting a link between GI health and microbiome composition. Diet was not related to stool consistency but did significantly impact gut microbiome composition; gut microbiome composition of wolves fed a kibble diet were significantly different than the gut microbiome composition of wolves fed a mixed, whole meat and wild diet. Findings from this study increase the understanding of the interplay between diet and GI health in the red wolf, a critical piece of information needed to maintain a healthy red wolf population ex situ.

## A core microbiota dominates a rich microbial diversity in the bovine udder and may indicate presence of dysbiosis.
 11.12.2020, _D Porcellato, R Meisal, A Bombelli, JA Narvhus_


The importance of the microbiome for bovine udder health is not well explored and most of the knowledge originates from research on mastitis. Better understanding of the microbial diversity inside the healthy udder of lactating cows might help to reduce mastitis, use of antibiotics and improve animal welfare. In this study, we investigated the microbial diversity of over 400 quarter milk samples from 60 cows sampled from two farms and on two different occasions during the same lactation period. Microbiota analysis was performed using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and over 1000 isolates were identified using MALDI-TOF MS. We detected a high abundance of two bacterial families, Corynebacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae, which accounted for almost 50% of the udder microbiota of healthy cows and were detected in all the cow udders and in more than 98% of quarter milk samples. A strong negative correlation between these bacterial families was detected indicating a possible competition. The overall composition of the udder microbiota was highly diverse and significantly different between cows and between quarter milk samples from the same cow. Furthermore, we introduced a novel definition of a dysbiotic quarter at individual cow level, by analyzing the milk microbiota, and a high frequency of dysbiotic quarter samples were detected distributed among the farms and the samples. These results emphasize the importance of deepening the studies of the bovine udder microbiome to elucidate its role in udder health.

The commensal microbiota of mosquitoes impacts their development, immunity, and competency, and could provide a target for alternative entomological control approaches. However, despite the importance of the mosquito/microbiota interactions, little is known about the relative contribution of endogenous and exogenous factors in shaping the bacterial communities of mosquitoes.

## Intestine Bacterial Community Composition of Shrimp Varies Under Low- and High-Salinity Culture Conditions.
 12.12.2020, _D Hou, R Zhou, S Zeng, D Wei, X Deng, C Xing, L Yu, Z Deng, H Wang, S Weng, J He, Z Huang_


Intestine microbiota is tightly associated with host health status. Increasing studies have focused on assessing how host intestine microbiota is affected by biotic factors but ignored abiotic factors. Here, we aimed to understand the effects of salinity on shrimp intestine microbiota, by comparing the differences of intestine bacterial signatures of shrimp under low-salinity (LS) and high-salinity (HS) culture conditions. Our results found that intestine core bacterial taxa of shrimp under LS and HS culture conditions were different and that under HS contained more opportunistic pathogen species. Notably, compared with LS culture conditions, opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Vibrio species) were enriched in shrimp intestine under HS. Network analysis revealed that shrimp under HS culture conditions exhibited less connected and lower competitive intestine bacterial interspecies interactions compared with LS. In addition, under HS culture conditions, several opportunistic pathogens were identified as keystone species of intestine bacterial network in shrimp. Furthermore, the ecological drift process played a more important role in the intestine bacterial assembly of shrimp under HS culture conditions than that under LS. These above traits regarding the intestine microbiota of shrimp under HS culture conditions might lead to host at a higher risk of disease. Collectively, this work aids our understanding of the effects of salinity on shrimp intestine microbiota and helps for shrimp culture.

## Host miRNA-21 promotes liver dysfunction by targeting small intestinal Lactobacillus in mice.
 10.12.2020, _AA Santos, MB Afonso, RS Ramiro, D Pires, M Pimentel, RE Castro, CMP Rodrigues_


New evidence shows that host-microbiota crosstalk can be modulated via endogenous miRNAs. We have previously reported that miR-21 ablation protects against liver injury in cholestasis. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-21 in modulating the gut microbiota during cholestasis and its effects in liver dysfunction. Mice lacking miR-21 had reduced liver damage and were protected against small intestinal injury as well as from gut microbiota dysbiosis when subjected to bile duct ligation surgery. The unique microbiota profile of miR-21KO mice was characterized by an increase in Lactobacillus, a key microbiome genus for gut homeostasis. Interestingly, in vitro incubation of synthetic miR-21 directly reduced Lactobacillus load. Moreover, supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri revealed reduced liver fibrosis in acute bile duct-ligated mice, mimicking the protective effects in miR-21 knockout mice. D-lactate, a main product of Lactobacillus, regulates gut homeostasis that may link with reduced liver fibrosis. Altogether, our results demonstrate that miR-21 promotes liver dysfunction through direct modulation of the gut microbiota and highlight the potential therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus supplementation in gut and liver homeostasis.

## Probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum strain JDFM216 improves cognitive behavior and modulates immune response with gut microbiota.
 11.12.2020, _MR Park, M Shin, D Mun, SY Jeong, DY Jeong, M Song, G Ko, T Unno, Y Kim, S Oh_


Increasing evidence indicates that alterations in gut microbiota are associated with mammalian development and physiology. The gut microbiota has been proposed as an essential player in metabolic diseases including brain health. This study aimed to determine the impact of probiotics on degenerative changes in the gut microbiota and cognitive behavior. Assessment of various behavioral and physiological functions was performed using Y-maze tests, wheel running tests, accelerated rotarod tests, balance beam tests, and forced swimming tests (FSTs), using adult mice after 50 weeks of administering living probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus fermentum strain JDFM216 or a vehicle. Immunomodulatory function was investigated using immune organs, immune cells and immune molecules in the mice, and gut microbiota was also evaluated in their feces. Notably, the L. fermentum JDFM216-treated group showed significantly better performance in the behavior tests (P &lt; 0.05) as well as improved phagocytic activity of macrophages, enhanced sIgA production, and stimulated immune cells (P &lt; 0.05). In aged mice, we observed decreases in species belonging to the Porphyromonadaceae family and the Lactobacillus genus when compared to young mice. While administering the supplementation of L. fermentum JDFM216 to aged mice did not shift the whole gut microbiota, the abundance of Lactobacillus species was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05). Our findings suggested that L. fermentum JDFM216 also provided beneficial effects on the regulation of immune responses, which has promising implications for functional foods. Taken together, L. fermentum JDFM216 could confer the benefit of improving health with enhanced cognition, physiological behavior, and immunity by modulating the gut microbiota.

## Plasmid Vectors for in Vivo Selection-Free Use with the Probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917.
 10.12.2020, _A Kan, I Gelfat, S Emani, P Praveschotinunt, NS Joshi_


Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) is a probiotic bacterium, commonly employed to treat certain gastrointestinal disorders. It is fast emerging as an important target for the development of therapeutic engineered bacteria, benefiting from the wealth of knowledge of E. coli biology and ease of manipulation. Bacterial synthetic biology projects commonly utilize engineered plasmid vectors, which are simple to engineer and can reliably achieve high levels of protein expression. However, plasmids typically require antibiotics for maintenance, and the administration of an antibiotic is often incompatible with in vivo experimentation or treatment. EcN natively contains plasmids pMUT1 and pMUT2, which have no known function but are stable within the bacteria. Here, we describe the development of the pMUT plasmids into a robust platform for engineering EcN for in vivo experimentation, alongside a CRISPR-Cas9 system to remove the native plasmids. We systematically engineered both pMUT plasmids to contain selection markers, fluorescent markers, temperature sensitive expression, and curli secretion systems to export a customizable functional material into the extracellular space. We then demonstrate that the engineered plasmids were maintained in bacteria as the engineered bacteria pass through the mouse GI tract without selection, and that the secretion system remains functional, exporting functionalized curli proteins into the gut. Our plasmid system presents a platform for the rapid development of therapeutic EcN bacteria.

Obesity and its associated diseases have become a major world-wide health problem. Purple-leaf Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) (PLT), that is rich of anthocyanins, has been shown to have preventive effects on obesity and metabolic disorders. The intestinal microbiota has been shown to contribute to inflammation, obesity, and several metabolic disorders. However, whether PLT consumption could prevent obesity and diet-induced metabolic diseases by modulating the gut microbiota, is not clearly understood.

## Dazomet application suppressed watermelon wilt by the altered soil microbial community.
 11.12.2020, _F Zhu, J Xiao, Y Zhang, L Wei, Z Liang_


Fusarium wilt disease causes severe decline of watermelon yield and quality. Researches have been reported that soil fumigation with dazomet can help control crop disease. Firstly, we discovered that the dazomet application suppressed watermelon wilt in field experiment compared to the control group. While the importance of microbial community in regulating plant health has been rising up, we therefore focused on examining the soil microbial diversity at six different sampling times after dazomet application by using Illumina MiSeq platform. Remarkably, our research results showed that some beneficial microbial genera have been altered, and these beneficial microbial genera have dominated the entire community, such as Nitrolancea, Pseudomonas and Penicillium after dazomet application. Instead, the relative abundance of Fusarium genus and the pathogen FON (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum, FON) had the decreased. As there was a significant accumulation of AP (available soil phosphorus) after dazomet application, we noticed that the beneficial microbes as Bacillus, Nitrolancea, Paenibacillus and Penicillium have significant positive correlation with AP but negatively related to morbidity. Together, these results demonstrate that the altered soil microbial community structure by dazomet application is critical to suppress watermelon Fusarium wilt. Thus, our results will drive investigations aimed to deploy interaction of microbiota contribute and plant immunity.

## Case Study upon Foliar Application of Biofertilizers Affecting Microbial Biomass and Enzyme Activity in Soil and Yield Related Properties of Maize and Wheat Grains.
 11.12.2020, _D Latkovic, J Maksimovic, Z Dinic, R Pivic, A Stanojkovic, A Stanojkovic-Sebic_


This study evaluated the effects of the application of microbial inoculants (N-fixing Klebsiella planticola and Enterobacter spp.), two rates of composite mineral fertilizers, and their combination on microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dehydrogenase (DHA), and proteinase activity (PTA) in Lessivated Cambisol and yield-related properties of maize and wheat grains in a two-year trial. Unfertilized soil was used as a control variant. MBC was measured using the chloroform fumigation-extraction method, DHA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the intensity of the formed red-colored triphenyl formazan, while PTA was determined using a titration method by measuring the degree of gelatine decomposition. In grain samples, P was determined spectrophotometrically, K-by flame emission photometry, N-on an elemental carbon/nitrogen/sulfur (CNS) analyzer, and crude proteins-by calculation of N content. Measuring both crops' yield was carried out at the end of the vegetation. The results indicated that mineral fertilizers are not, in general, negative for soil microbiota when used in the context of sustainable agriculture without monoculture. There is a significant increase in the values of soil MBC, DHA, and PTA in the variants with combined application of bacterial inoculants and lower rates of mineral fertilizers. The highest values of these parameters were determined in the period with a better distribution of precipitation during the vegetation period of the year. The mentioned combination also resulted in a higher grain yield of maize and wheat comparing to the application of lower rates of the NPK nutrients solely. The combined application of high rates of mineral fertilizers and bacterial inoculants resulted in significantly increased N, P, K, and protein content in the grains of crops, and the same applied to yield. Concluding, studied bacterial inoculants can be used to specify the replacement of nitrogen fertilizers, stimulating the microbial biomass and enzyme activity in the soil, helping to ensure that the supply of nutrients contributing to an optimized yield of crops is maintained.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing is a valuable tool for the taxonomic and functional profiling of microbial communities. However, this approach is challenging in samples, such as milk, where a low microbial abundance, combined with high levels of host DNA, result in inefficient and uneconomical sequencing. Here we evaluate approaches to deplete host DNA or enrich microbial DNA prior to sequencing using three commercially available kits. We compared the percentage of microbial reads obtained from each kit after shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Using bovine and human milk samples, we determined that host depletion with the MolYsis complete5 kit significantly improved microbial sequencing depth compared to other approaches tested. Importantly, no biases were introduced. Additionally, the increased microbial sequencing depth allowed for further characterization of the microbiome through the generation of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Furthermore, with the use of a mock community, we compared three common classifiers and determined that Kraken2 was the optimal classifier for these samples. This evaluation shows that microbiome analysis can be performed on both bovine and human milk samples at a much greater resolution without the need for more expensive deep-sequencing approaches.

## Systematic evaluation of supervised machine learning for sample origin prediction using metagenomic sequencing data.
 11.12.2020, _JC Chen, AD Tyler_


The advent of metagenomic sequencing provides microbial abundance patterns that can be leveraged for sample origin prediction. Supervised machine learning classification approaches have been reported to predict sample origin accurately when the origin has been previously sampled. Using metagenomic datasets provided by the 2019 CAMDA challenge, we evaluated the influence of variable technical, analytical and machine learning approaches for result interpretation and novel source prediction.
