## Metagenomic analysis reveals the shared and distinct features of the soil resistome across tundra, temperate prairie, and tropical ecosystems.
 15.05.2021, _X Qian, S Gunturu, J Guo, B Chai, JR Cole, J Gu, JM Tiedje_


Soil is an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), but their potential risk in different ecosystems as well as response to anthropogenic land use change is unknown. We used a metagenomic approach and datasets with well-characterized metadata to investigate ARG types and amounts in soil DNA of three native ecosystems: Alaskan tundra, US Midwestern prairie, and Amazon rainforest, as well as the effect of conversion of the latter two to agriculture and pasture, respectively.

## Potential and expression of carbohydrate utilization by marine fungi in the global ocean.

Most of the research on the cycling of carbon in the open-ocean has focused on heterotrophic prokaryotes and eukaryotic phytoplankton, but the role of pelagic fungi remains largely enigmatic.
