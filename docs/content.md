The COVID-19, the disease caused by a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly across the globe. It has caused outbreaks of illness due to person-to-person transmission of the virus mainly via close contacts and droplets produced by an infected person's cough or sneeze. Exhaled droplets from infected patients with COVID-19 can be inhaled into the lungs and leads to respiratory illness such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although aerosol therapy is a mainstay procedure used to treat pulmonary diseases at home and healthcare settings, it has a potential for fugitive emissions during therapy due to the generation of aerosols and droplets as a source of respiratory pathogens. Delivering aerosolized medications to patients with COVID-19 can aggravate the spread of the novel coronavirus. This has been a real concern for caregivers and healthcare professionals who are susceptible to unintended inhalation of fugitive emissions during therapy. Due to a scarcity of information in this area of clinical practice, the purpose of this paper is to explain how to deliver aerosolized medications to mild-, sub-intensive, and intensive-care patients with COVID-19 and how to protect staff from exposure to exhaled droplets during aerosol therapy.

## The role of gastric microbiota in gastric cancer.
 25.05.2020, _OA Stewart, F Wu, Y Chen_


Gastric cancer represents one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the strongest risk factor associated with gastric cancer. Due to new molecular techniques allowing greater identification of stomach microbes, investigators are beginning to examine the role that bacteria other than H. pylori play in gastric cancer development. Recently, researchers have investigated how the composition of the gastric microbiota varies among individuals with various stages of gastric disease. Specific microbes residing in the stomach have been preferentially associated with gastric cancer patients compared to individuals with a healthy gastric mucosa. Studies conducted on the insulin-gastrin (INS-GAS) transgenic mouse model have provided additional insight into the association between the gastric microbiota and gastric cancer. The purpose of this article is to review the current state of literature on the relationship between the gastric microbiota and gastric cancer based on clinical studies performed to date.

## Ongoing Supplementation of Probiotics to Cesarean-Born Neonates during the First Month of Life may Impact the Gut Microbial.
 23.05.2020, _W Yang, L Tian, J Luo, J Yu_


The delivery mode is considered to be a significant influencing factor in the early gut microbiota composition, which is associated with the long-term health of the host. In this study, we tried to explore the effects of probiotics on the intestinal microbiota of C-section neonates.

## Efficacies of different ovarian hyperstimulation protocols in poor ovarian responders classified by the POSEIDON criteria.
 29.05.2020, _F Li, T Ye, H Kong, J Li, L Hu, H Jin, Y Su, G Li_


We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 45,912 in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles in our reproductive medical center. We compared the clinical outcomes of three different ovarian hyperstimulation protocols in poor ovarian responders (classified by the POSEIDON criteria) to determine the most effective protocol for each POSEIDON group. In POSEIDON groups 1 and 3, the early-follicular-phase long-acting GnRH-agonist long (EFLL) protocol was associated with higher pregnancy rates per transfer and higher live birth rates than the mid-luteal-phase short-acting GnRH-agonist long (MLSL) and GnRH-antagonist protocols. We also examined the relationship between advanced age and reproductive outcomes, and observed a negative correlation between age and live birth rate for each protocol (EFLL: OR = 0.890, 95% CI: 0.870 - 0.911, P &lt; 0.001; MLSL: OR = 0.907, 95% CI: 0.885 - 0.926, P &lt; 0.001; GnRH-antagonist: OR = 0.891, 95% CI: 0.857 - 0.926, P &lt; 0.001). In terms of clinical outcomes, EFLL was the most effective protocol for young poor ovarian responders. However, there were no differences in the implantation rates, clinical pregnancy rates, or live birth rates among the protocols in older patients. Age is thus the most important determinant of oocyte quality, embryo ploidy, and delivery rate.

## Exploring the eukaryotic diversity in rumen of Indian camel (Camelus dromedarius) using 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing.
 25.05.2020, _P Mishra, NJ Tulsani, SJ Jakhesara, NA Dafale, NV Patil, HJ Purohit, PG Koringa, CG Joshi_


In addition to a wide variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria, camel rumen also harbors a diverse of eukaryotic organisms. In the present study, the eukaryotic communities of camel rumen were characterized using 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Metagenomic DNA was isolated from rumen samples of fourteen adult Bikaneri and Kachchhi breeds of camel fed different diets containing Jowar, Bajra, Maize, and Guar. Illumina sequencing generated 27,161,904 number of reads corresponding to 1543 total operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Taxonomic classification of community metagenome sequences from all the samples revealed the presence of 92 genera belonging to 16 different divisions, out of which Ciliophora (73%), Fungi (13%) and Streptophyta (9%) were found to be the most dominant. Notably, the abundance of Ciliophora was significantly higher in the case of Guar feed, while Fungi was significantly higher in the case of Maize feed, indicating the influence of cellulose and hemicellulose content of feedstuff on the composition of eukaryotes. The results suggest that the camel rumen eukaryotes are highly dynamic and depend on the type of diet given to the animal. Pearson's correlation analysis suggested the ciliate protozoa and fungi were negatively correlated with each other. To the best of our knowledge, this is first systematic study to characterize camel rumen eukaryotes, which has provided newer information regarding eukaryotic diversity patterns amongst camel fed on different diets.
