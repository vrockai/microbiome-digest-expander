## Iron homeostasis in host and gut bacteria - a complex interrelationship.
 05.02.2021, _Y Seyoum, K Baye, C Humblot_


Iron deficiency is the most frequent nutritional deficiency in the world with an estimated 1.4 billion people affected. The usual way to fight iron deficiency is iron fortification, but this approach is not always effective and can have undesirable side effects including an increase in the growth and virulence of gut bacterial pathogens responsible for diarrhea and gut inflammation. Iron is mainly absorbed in the duodenum and is tightly regulated in mammals. Unabsorbed iron enters the colonic lumen where many microorganisms, referred to as gut microbiota, reside. Iron is essential for these bacteria, and its availability consequently affects this microbial ecosystem. The aim of this review is to provide further insights into the complex relationship between iron and gut microbiota. Given that overcoming anemia caused by iron deficiency is still a challenge today, gut microbiota could help identify more efficient ways to tackle this public health problem.

## α1-3Gal antigen in gut microbiota, a potential new environmental factor in multiple sclerosis.
 08.02.2021, _L Boussamet, E Montassier, JP Soulillou, L Berthelot_


Gut microbiota from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients present qualitative and quantitative differences of bacteria abundance compared to healthy subjects. In an another hand, gut microbiota may drive some specific types of antibody responses in human and may represent a new environmental factor in MS etiology. However, whether and to which extent the amount of a given microbiota antigen is associated with the level of the antibody response against the corresponding antigen is yet unknown. The level of anti-α1-3Gal (Gal) antibodies are decreased in MS. Recently, we have proposed a first map of gut bacteria displaying α1-3-Galactosyltransferase gene sequences. This review summarizes the current knowledge on antibody response to the Gal epitope associated to changes of gut microbiota profile in MS as well as on the possible mechanisms by which the altered microbiota and/or circulating anti-Gal level could affect the immune response in this disease.

## Alterations in the gut bacterial microbiome in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy.

Gut bacterial microbiome dysbiosis in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) has been reported, but such an association with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is not known. We explored possible link between gut bacterial microbiome dysbiosis and DR. Using fecal samples of healthy controls (HC) and people with T2DM with/without DR, gut bacterial communities were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and data analysed using QIIME and R software. Dysbiosis in the gut microbiomes, at phyla and genera level, was observed in people with T2DM and DR compared to HC. People with DR exhibited greater discrimination from HC. Microbiomes of people with T2DM and DR were also significantly different. Both DM and DR microbiomes showed a decrease in anti-inflammatory, probiotic and other bacteria that could be pathogenic, compared to HC, and the observed change was more pronounced in people with DR. This is the first report demonstrating dysbiosis in the gut microbiome (alteration in the diversity and abundance at the phyla and genera level) in people with DR compared to HC. Such studies would help in developing novel and targeted therapies to improve treatment of DR.
