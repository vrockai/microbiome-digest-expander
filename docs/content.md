_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Understanding links between maternal perinatal posttraumatic stress symptoms and infant socioemotional and physical health.
 05.05.2022, _L Huffhines, JL Coe, A Busuito, R Seifer, SH Parade_


Maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are associated with adverse consequences for older children, but very few studies have examined links between perinatal maternal PTSS and infant outcomes. Trauma exposure and psychopathology, including PTSS, is often heightened for women during pregnancy through 1 year postpartum. Therefore, the perinatal period may be a critical time for understanding the risk maternal PTSS and other mental health factors pose to the socioemotional and physical health of infants. The present study explored the relation between maternal PTSS and infant socioemotional and physical health problems in a sample of racially and ethnically diverse mother-infant dyads (N = 295) assessed prenatally and at 12 months postpartum. This study also examined whether there are: (1) moderating effects of maternal depressive symptoms and parenting stress on these associations and (2) indirect effects of PTSS on infant outcomes through observed maternal sensitivity. Results indicated that postpartum depressive symptoms and parenting stress, rather than PTSS, were associated with greater infant socioemotional health problems. However, prenatal PTSS were associated with greater infant physical health problems when mothers also reported clinically significant levels of postpartum depressive symptoms. Maternal sensitivity was not associated with maternal PTSS, depressive symptoms, or parenting stress, nor was it related to infant socioemotional and physical health; thus, maternal sensitivity was not tested as an intermediary mechanism linking maternal mental health with infant outcomes. Implications for promoting maternal mental health in the perinatal period to bolster socioemotional and physical health of infants are discussed.

## A snapshot of the global drinking water virome: Diversity and metabolic potential vary with residual disinfectant use.
 03.05.2022, _B Hegarty, Z Dai, L Raskin, A Pinto, K Wigginton, M Duhaime_


Viruses are important drivers of microbial community ecology and evolution, influencing microbial mortality, metabolism, and horizontal gene transfer. However, the effects of viruses remain largely unknown in many environments, including in drinking water systems. Drinking water metagenomic studies have offered a whole community perspective of bacterial impacts on water quality, but have not yet considered the influences of viruses. In this study, we address this gap by mining viral DNA sequences from publicly available drinking water metagenomes from distribution systems in six countries around the world. These datasets provide a snapshot of the taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential of the global drinking water virome; and provide an opportunity to investigate the effects of geography, climate, and drinking water treatment practices on viral diversity. Both environmental conditions and differences in sample processing were found to influence the viral composition. Using free chlorine as the residual disinfectant was associated with clear differences in viral taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential, with significantly fewer viral populations and less even viral community structures than observed in distribution systems without residual disinfectant. Additionally, drinking water viruses carry antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as well as genes to survive oxidative stress and nitrogen limitation. Through this study, we have demonstrated that viral communities are diverse across drinking water systems and vary with the use of residual disinfectant. Our findings offer directions for future research to develop a more robust understanding of how virus-bacteria interactions in drinking water distribution systems affect water quality.

## A deep siamese neural network improves metagenome-assembled genomes in microbiome datasets across different environments.
 03.05.2022, _S Pan, C Zhu, XM Zhao, LP Coelho_


_Algorithms, Metagenome, Metagenomics, Microbiota, Neural Networks, Computer_
Metagenomic binning is the step in building metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) when sequences predicted to originate from the same genome are automatically grouped together. The most widely-used methods for binning are reference-independent, operating de novo and enable the recovery of genomes from previously unsampled clades. However, they do not leverage the knowledge in existing databases. Here, we introduce SemiBin, an open source tool that uses deep siamese neural networks to implement a semi-supervised approach, i.e. SemiBin exploits the information in reference genomes, while retaining the capability of reconstructing high-quality bins that are outside the reference dataset. Using simulated and real microbiome datasets from several different habitats from GMGCv1 (Global Microbial Gene Catalog), including the human gut, non-human guts, and environmental habitats (ocean and soil), we show that SemiBin outperforms existing state-of-the-art binning methods. In particular, compared to other methods, SemiBin returns more high-quality bins with larger taxonomic diversity, including more distinct genera and species.
