## Dipeptide-catalysed Michael reaction under physiological conditions: Examination of potential bioorthogonality.
 16.03.2024, _F Schuster, BW Grau, HG Xu, A Mokhir, SB Tsogoeva_


Reactions for drug synthesis under cell-like conditions or even inside living cells can potentially be used e.g., to minimize toxic side effects, to maximize bioactive compound efficacy and/or to address drug delivery problems. Those reactions should be bioorthogonal to enable the generation of drug-like compounds with sufficiently good yields. In the known bioorthogonal Michael reactions, using thiols and phosphines as nucleophiles (e.g., in CS and CP bond formation reactions) is very common. No bioorthogonal Michael addition with a carbon nucleophile is known yet. Therefore, the development of such a reaction might be interesting for future drug discovery research. In this work, the metal-free Michael addition between cyclohexanone and various trans-β-nitrostyrenes (CC bond formation reaction), catalysed by a dipeptide salt H-Pro-Phe-O-Na+, was investigated for the first time in the presence of glutathione (GSH) and in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). We demonstrated that with electron-withdrawing substituents on the aromatic ring and in β-position of the trans-β-nitrostyrene yields up to 64% can be obtained under physiological conditions, indicating a potential bioorthogonality of the studied Michael reaction. In addition, the selected Michael products demonstrated activity against human ovarian cancer cells A2780. This study opens up a new vista for forming bioactive compounds via CC bond formation Michael reactions under physiological (cell-like) conditions.

 18.03.2024, _HF Wang, WC Liu, H Zailani, CC Yang, TB Chen, CM Chang, IJ Tsai, CP Yang, KP Su_


Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may benefit migraine improvement, though prior studies are inconclusive. This study evaluated the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on episodic migraine (EM) prevention. Seventy individuals with EM participated in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from March 2020 and May 2022. They were randomly assigned to either the EPA (N = 35, 2 g fish oil with 1.8 mg of EPA as a stand-alone treatment daily), or the placebo group (N = 35, 2 g soybean oil daily). Migraine frequency and headache severity were assessed using the monthly migraine days, visual analog scale (VAS), Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in comparison to baseline measurements. The EPA group significantly outperformed the placebo in reducing monthly migraine days (-4.4 ± 5.1 days vs. - 0.6 ± 3.5 days, p = 0.001), days using acute headache medication (-1.3 ± 3.0 days vs. 0.1 ± 2.3 days, p = 0.035), improving scores for headache severity (ΔVAS score: -1.3 ± 2.4 vs. 0.0 ± 2.2, p = 0.030), disability (ΔMIDAS score: -13.1 ± 16.2 vs. 2.6 ± 20.2, p = 0.001), anxiety and depression (ΔHADS score: -3.9 ± 9.4 vs. 1.1 ± 9.1, p = 0.025), and quality of life (ΔMSQ score: -11.4 ± 19.0 vs. 3.1 ± 24.6, p = 0.007). Notably, female particularly benefited from EPA, underscoring its potential in migraine management. In conclusion, high-dose EPA has significantly reduced migraine frequency and severity, improved psychological symptoms and quality of life in EM patients, and shown no major adverse events, suggesting its potential as a prophylactic for EM.

_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

 21.12.2020, _A Garber, PM Hastie, V Farci, D McGuinness, L Bulmer, O Alzahal, JMD Murray_


_Animal Feed, Animals, Diet, Feces, Horses, Male, Microbiota, Saccharomyces cerevisiae_
There is a need to develop feeding strategies to prevent the adverse effect of concentrate feeding in high-performance horses fed energy-dense diets aiming to maintain their health and welfare. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a VistaEQ product containing 4% live yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), with activity 5 × 108 colony-forming unit/g and fed 2 g/pony per day, on faecal microbial populations when supplemented with high-starch and high-fibre diets using Illumina next generation sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The four treatments were allocated to eight mature Welsh section A pony geldings enrolled in a 4-period × 8 animal crossover design. Each 19-day experimental period consisted of an 18-day adaptation phase and a single collection day, followed by a 7-day wash out period. After DNA extraction from faeces and library preparation, α-diversity and linear discriminant analysis effect size were performed using 16S metagenomics pipeline in Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME™) and Galaxy/Hutlab. Differences between the groups were considered significant when linear discriminant analysis score was &gt;2 corresponding to P &lt; 0.05. The present study showed that S. cerevisiae used was able to induce positive changes in the equine microbiota when supplemented to a high-fibre diet: it increased relative abundance (RA) of Lachnospiraceae and Dehalobacteriaceae family members associated with a healthy core microbiome. Yeast supplementation also increased the RA of fibrolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus) when fed with a high-fibre diet and reduced the RA of lactate producing bacteria (Streptococcus) when a high-starch diet was fed. In addition, yeast increased the RA of acetic, succinic acid producing bacterial family (Succinivibrionaceae) and butyrate producing bacterial genus (Roseburia) when fed with high-starch and high-fibre diets, respectively. VistaEQ supplementation to equine diets can be potentially used to prevent acidosis and increase fibre digestibility. It may help to meet the energy requirements of performance horses while maintaining gut health.

## Single-Phase Covalent Organic Framework Staggered Stacking Nanosheet Membrane for CO2 -Selective Separation.
 17.08.2021, _P Wang, Y Peng, C Zhu, R Yao, H Song, L Kun, W Yang_


Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are considered as potential candidates for gas separation membranes, benefiting from permanent porosity, light-weight skeletons, excellent stability and facilely-tailored functionalities. However, their pore sizes are generally larger than the kinetic diameters of common gas molecules. One great challenge is the fabrication of single-phase COF membranes to realize precise gas separations. Herein, three kinds of high-quality β-ketoenamine-type COF nanosheets with different pore sizes were developed and aggregated to ultrathin nanosheet membranes with distinctive staggered stacking patterns. The narrowed pore sizes derived from the micro-structures and selective adsorption capacities synergistically endowed the COF membranes with intriguing CO2 -philic separation performances, among which TpPa-2 with medium pore size exhibited an optimal CO2 /H2 separation factor of 22 and a CO2 permeance of 328 gas permeation units at 298 K. This membrane performance reached the target with commercial feasibility for syngas separations.

## Pracinostat combined with azacitidine in newly diagnosed adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients unfit for standard induction chemotherapy: PRIMULA phase III study.
 18.03.2024, _G Garcia-Manero, M Kazmierczak, A Wierzbowska, CY Fong, MK Keng, G Ballinari, F Scarci, L Adès_


Non-intensive therapies such as the hypomethylating agent (HMA) azacitidine (AZA) have been used in patients with AML ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy (IC) or stem cell transplant due to advanced age, comorbidities, and/or risk factors. However, response rates and survival remain dismal. Pre-clinical studies indicate the epigenetic combination of HMAs and HDAC inhibitors induce re-expression of silenced genes synergistically. The activity of pracinostat, an oral pan-HDAC inhibitor, has been shown in xenograft tumor models of AML and promising efficacy was seen in a Phase 2 study. This Phase 3 study (NCT03151408) evaluated the efficacy/safety of pracinostat administered with AZA in adult patients with newly diagnosed AML ineligible to receive IC. Patients were randomized to either pracinostat plus AZA or placebo/AZA and stratified by cytogenetic risk and ECOG status. As planned, an interim analysis was performed when 232/390 events (deaths) occurred. A total of 406 patients were randomized (203/group) at the time of the analysis. Median overall survival was 9.95 months for both treatment groups (p=0.8275). There was no significant difference between treatments in secondary efficacy endpoints, reflecting a lack of clinical response. This study did not show a benefit of adding pracinostat to AZA in elderly patients unfit for IC.

Species of the Bacteroidales order are among the most abundant and stable bacterial members of the human gut microbiome with diverse impacts on human health. While Bacteroidales strains and species are genomically and functionally diverse, order-wide comparative analyses are lacking. We cultured and sequenced the genomes of 408 Bacteroidales isolates from healthy human donors representing nine genera and 35 species and performed comparative genomic, gene-specific, mobile gene, and metabolomic analyses. Families, genera, and species could be grouped based on many distinctive features. However, we also show extensive DNA transfer between diverse families, allowing for shared traits and strain evolution. Inter- and intra-specific diversity is also apparent in the metabolomic profiling studies. This highly characterized and diverse Bacteroidales culture collection with strain-resolved genomic and metabolomic analyses can serve as a resource to facilitate informed selection of strains for microbiome reconstitution.

Data regarding COVID-19 outcomes in solid organ transplant recipients(SOTr) across SARS-CoV-2 waves, including the impact of different measures, is lacking. This cohort study, conducted from March 2020-May 2023 in Toronto, Canada, aimed to analyze COVID-19 outcomes in 1,975 SOTr across various SARS-CoV-2 waves and assess the impact of preventive and treatment measures. The primary outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as requiring supplemental oxygen, with secondary outcomes including hospitalization, length of stay, ICU admission, and 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. SARS-CoV-2 waves were categorized as Wildtype/Alpha/Delta(318 cases, 16.1%), Omicron-BA.1(268, 26.2%), Omicron-BA.2(268, 13.6%), Omicron-BA.5(561, 28.4%), Omicron-BQ.1.1(188, 9.5%), and Omicron-XBB.1.5(123, 6.2%). Severe COVID-19 rate was highest during the Wildtype/Alpha/Delta wave(44.6%), and lower in Omicron waves(5.7-16.1%). Lung transplantation was associated with severe COVID-19(OR:4.62, 95%CI:2.71-7.89), along with rituximab treatment(OR:4.24, 95%CI:1.04-17.3), long-term corticosteroid use(OR:3.11, 95%CI:1.46-6.62), older age(OR: 1.51, 95%CI:1.30-1.76), chronic lung disease(OR:2.11, 95%CI:1.36-3.30), chronic kidney disease(OR:2.18, 95%CI:1.17-4.07), and diabetes(OR:1.97, 95%CI:1.37-2.83). Early treatment and ≥3 vaccine doses were associated with reduced severity(OR: 0.29, 95%CI:0.19-0.46, and 0.35, 95%CI:0.21-0.60, respectively). Tixagevimab/cilgavimab and bivalent boosters did not show a significant impact. The study concludes that COVID-19 severity decreased across different variants in SOTr. Lung transplantation was associated with worse outcomes and may benefit more from preventive and early therapeutic interventions.

## Global abundance patterns, diversity, and ecology of Patescibacteria in wastewater treatment plants.
 18.03.2024, _H Hu, JM Kristensen, CW Herbold, P Pjevac, K Kitzinger, B Hausmann, MKD Dueholm, PH Nielsen, M Wagner_


_Wastewater, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Bacteria, Microbiota, Water Purification_
Microorganisms are responsible for nutrient removal and resource recovery in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and their diversity is often studied by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. However, this approach underestimates the abundance and diversity of Patescibacteria due to the low coverage of commonly used PCR primers for this highly divergent bacterial phylum. Therefore, our current understanding of the global diversity, distribution, and ecological role of Patescibacteria in WWTPs is very incomplete. This is particularly relevant as Patescibacteria are considered to be associated with microbial host cells and can therefore influence the abundance and temporal variability of other microbial groups that are important for WWTP functioning.

_Humans, Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, Lung Neoplasms, Immunotherapy, Transcription Factors_
Current treatment guidelines refer to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), one of the deadliest human malignancies, as a homogeneous disease. Accordingly, SCLC therapy comprises chemoradiation with or without immunotherapy. Meanwhile, recent studies have made significant advances in subclassifying SCLC based on the elevated expression of the transcription factors ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3, as well as on certain inflammatory characteristics. The role of the transcription regulator YAP1 in defining a unique SCLC subset remains to be established. Although preclinical analyses have described numerous subtype-specific characteristics and vulnerabilities, the so far non-existing clinical subtype distinction may be a contributor to negative clinical trial outcomes. This comprehensive review aims to provide a framework for the development of novel personalized therapeutic approaches by compiling the most recent discoveries achieved by preclinical SCLC research. We highlight the challenges faced due to limited access to patient material as well as the advances accomplished by implementing state-of-the-art models and methodologies.

Most stratified sulfidic holomictic lakes become oxygenated after annual turnover. In contrast, Lake Rogoznica, on the eastern Adriatic coast, has been observed to undergo a period of water column anoxia after water layer mixing and establishment of holomictic conditions. Although Lake Rogoznica's chemistry and hydrography have been studied extensively, it is unclear how the microbial communities typically inhabiting the oxic epilimnion and a sulfidic hypolimnion respond to such a drastic shift in redox conditions. We investigated the impact of anoxic holomixis on microbial diversity and microbially mediated sulfur cycling in Lake Rogoznica with an array of culture-independent microbiological methods. Our data suggest a tight coupling between the lake's chemistry and occurring microorganisms. During stratification, anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria were dominant at the chemocline and in the hypolimnion. After an anoxic mixing event, the anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria entirely disappeared, and the homogeneous, anoxic water column was dominated by a bloom of gammaproteobacterial sulfur oxidizers related to the GSO/SUP05 clade. This study is the first report of a community shift from phototrophic to chemotrophic sulfide oxidizers as a response to anoxic holomictic conditions in a seasonally stratified seawater lake.
