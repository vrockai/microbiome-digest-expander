 03.09.2020, _P Rubbens, R Props, FM Kerckhof, N Boon, W Waegeman_


Variations in the gut microbiome have been associated with changes in health state such as Crohn's disease (CD). Most surveys characterize the microbiome through analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. An alternative technology that can be used is flow cytometry. In this report, we reanalyzed a disease cohort that has been characterized by both technologies. Changes in microbial community structure are reflected in both types of data. We demonstrate that cytometric fingerprints can be used as a diagnostic tool in order to classify samples according to CD state. These results highlight the potential of flow cytometry to perform rapid diagnostics of microbiome-associated diseases.

## The Gut Microbiome, Inflammation, and Salt-Sensitive Hypertension.
 04.09.2020, _F Elijovich, CL Laffer, M Sahinoz, A Pitzer, JF Ferguson, A Kirabo_


Salt sensitivity of blood pressure (SSBP) is an independent predictor of death due to cardiovascular events and affects nearly 50% of the hypertensive and 25% of the normotensive population. Strong evidence indicates that reducing sodium (Na+) intake decreases blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular events. The precise mechanisms of how dietary Na+ contributes to elevation and cardiovascular disease remain unclear. The goal of this review is to discuss mechanisms of salt-induced cardiovascular disease and how the microbiome may play a role.

The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that acts to enhance inflammatory responses by promoting the production and secretion of key cytokines. The best-known inflammasome is the NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor [NLR] family pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome. The evidence has shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome, IL-1β, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), and pyroptosis play vital roles in the development of diabetes. This review summarizes the regulation of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by NLRP3 via modulation of glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, inflammation, and apoptosis mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress in adipose tissue. Moreover, NLRP3 participates in intestinal homeostasis and inflammatory conditions, and NLRP3-deficient mice experience intestinal lesions. The diversity of an individual's gut microbiome and the resultant microbial metabolites determines the extent of their involvement in the physiological and pathological mechanisms within the gut. As such, further study of the interaction between the NLRP3 inflammasome and the complex intestinal environment in disease development is warranted to discover novel therapies for the treatment of diabetes.

## The Role of the Microbiome in Cancer and Therapy Efficacy: Focus on Lung Cancer.
 03.09.2020, _A Halley, A Leonetti, A Gregori, M Tiseo, DM Deng, E Giovannetti, GJ Peters_


The microbiome is extremely important for human health; more recently its role in the context of cancer became clear. Microbial effects range from enhancing cancer immunity and cancer therapy efficacy, to promoting cancer progression and inhibiting treatment efficacy. These broad implications led researchers to investigate these specific interactions, as well as how modification of the microbiome can improve cancer survival and treatment efficacy. While these interactions are better established for cancers such as gastric cancer, they are far less understood in others. As non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up the majority of lung cancer cases, and is among the top causes of cancer deaths worldwide, understanding the mechanisms by which the microbiome may impact progression and treatment is crucial to improve patient survival and treatment response. A literature review was conducted to reveal the crosslink between human microbiome and lung cancer. This includes immune priming, induction of pro- or anti-tumor response, and the local effects of intra-tumoral microbiota. Overall, this is a complex multifactorial relationship, and there are broad implications as to how this knowledge can improve cancer treatment. Solutions include manipulation of the microbiome using probiotics, bacterial vaccines and antibiotics. Bacteria biomarkers may also be used as a diagnostic tool.

## Breast and Gut Microbiota Action Mechanisms in Breast Cancer Pathogenesis and Treatment.
 03.09.2020, _A Laborda-Illanes, L Sanchez-Alcoholado, ME Dominguez-Recio, B Jimenez-Rodriguez, R Lavado, I Comino-Méndez, E Alba, MI Queipo-Ortuño_


In breast cancer (BC) the employment of sequencing technologies for metagenomic analyses has allowed not only the description of the overall metagenomic landscape but also the specific microbial changes and their functional implications. Most of the available data suggest that BC is related to bacterial dysbiosis in both the gut microenvironment and breast tissue. It is hypothesized that changes in the composition and functions of several breast and gut bacterial taxa may contribute to BC development and progression through several pathways. One of the most prominent roles of gut microbiota is the regulation of steroid-hormone metabolism, such as estrogens, a component playing an important role as risk factor in BC development, especially in postmenopausal women. On the other hand, breast and gut resident microbiota are the link in the reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and their local environment, since microbiota are capable of modulating mucosal and systemic immune responses. Several in vivo and in vitro studies show remarkable evidence that diet, probiotics and prebiotics could exert important anticarcinogenic effects in BC. Moreover, gut microbiota have an important role in the metabolism of chemotherapeutic drugs and in the activity of immunogenic chemotherapies since they are a potential dominant mediator in the response to cancer therapy. Then, the microbiome impact in BC is multi-factorial, and the gut and breast tissue bacteria population could be important in regulating the local immune system, in tumor formation and progression and in therapy response and/or resistance.

## Influence of Resveratrol on the Cardiovascular Health Effects of Chronic Kidney Disease.
 03.09.2020, _JY Song, TC Shen, YC Hou, JF Chang, CL Lu, WC Liu, PJ Chen, BH Chen, CM Zheng, KC Lu_


Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is closely related to chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients with CKD have a high risk of CVD-related mortality. Traditional CVD risk factors cannot account for the higher cardiovascular risk of patients with CKD, and standard CVD interventions cannot reduce the mortality rates among patients with CKD. Nontraditional factors related to mineral and vitamin-D metabolic disorders provide some explanation for the increased CVD risk. Non-dialyzable toxins, indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresol sulfate (PCS)-produced in the liver by colonic microorganisms-cause kidney and vascular dysfunction. Plasma trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)-a gut microbe-dependent metabolite of dietary L-carnitine and choline-is elevated in CKD and related to vascular disease, resulting in poorer long-term survival. Therefore, the modulation of colonic flora can improve prospects for patients with CKD. Managing metabolic syndrome, anemia, and abnormal mineral metabolism is recommended for the prevention of CVD in patients with CKD. Considering nontraditional risk factors, the use of resveratrol (RSV), a nutraceutical, can be helpful for patients with CVD and CKD. This paper discusses the beneficial effects of RSV on biologic, pathophysiological and clinical responses, including improvements in intestinal epithelial integrity, modulation of the intestinal microbiota and reduction in hepatic synthesis of IS, PCS and TMAO in patients with CVD and CKD.

Objective The relationship between gut microbiota and portal hypertension remains unclear. We investigated the characteristics of the gut microbiota in portal hypertension patients with esophago-gastric varices and liver cirrhosis. Methods Thirty-six patients (12 patients with portal hypertension, 12 healthy controls, and 12 non-cirrhosis patients) were enrolled in this university hospital study. Intestinal bacteria and statistical analyses were performed up to the genus level using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism method targeting 16S ribosomal RNA genes, with diversified regions characterizing each bacterium. Results Levels of Lactobacillales were significantly higher (p=0.045) and those of Clostridium cluster IV significantly lower (p=0.014) in patients with portal hypertension than in other patients. This Clostridium cluster contains many butanoic acid-producing strains, including Ruminococcace and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Clostridium cluster IX levels were also significantly lower (p=0.045) in portal hypertension patients than in other patients. There are many strains of Clostridium that produce propionic acid, and the effects on the host and the function of these bacterial species in the human intestine remain unknown. Regarding the Bifidobacterium genus, which is supposed to decrease as a result of cirrhosis, no significant decrease was observed in this study. Conclusion In the present study, we provided information on the characteristics of the gut microbiota of portal hypertension patients with esophago-gastric varices due to liver cirrhosis. In the future, we aim to develop probiotic treatments following further analyses that include the species level, such as the intestinal flora analysis method and next-generation sequencers.

## Type I IFNs and CD8 T cells increase intestinal barrier permeability after chronic viral infection.
 04.09.2020, _L Labarta-Bajo, SP Nilsen, G Humphrey, T Schwartz, K Sanders, A Swafford, R Knight, JR Turner, EI Zúñiga_


Intestinal barrier leakage constitutes a potential therapeutic target for many inflammatory diseases and represents a disease progression marker during chronic viral infections. However, the causes of altered gut barrier remain mostly unknown. Using murine infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, we demonstrate that, in contrast to an acute viral strain, a persistent viral isolate leads to long-term viral replication in hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells, but not epithelial cells (IECs), in the intestine. Viral persistence drove sustained intestinal epithelial barrier leakage, which was characterized by increased paracellular flux of small molecules and was associated with enhanced colitis susceptibility. Type I IFN signaling caused tight junction dysregulation in IECs, promoted gut microbiome shifts and enhanced intestinal CD8 T cell responses. Notably, both type I IFN receptor blockade and CD8 T cell depletion prevented infection-induced barrier leakage. Our study demonstrates that infection with a virus that persistently replicates in the intestinal mucosa increases epithelial barrier permeability and reveals type I IFNs and CD8 T cells as causative factors of intestinal leakage during chronic infections.
