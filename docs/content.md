## Assessing the joint effects of brain aging and gut microbiota on the risks of psychiatric disorders.
 25.01.2022, _H Zhang, L Liu, S Cheng, Y Jia, Y Wen, X Yang, P Meng, C Li, C Pan, Y Chen, Z Zhang, J Zhang, F Zhang_


We aim to explore the potential interaction effects of brain aging and gut microbiota on the risks of sleep, anxiety and depression disorders. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets of brain aging (N = 21,407) and gut microbiota (N = 3,890) were obtained from published studies. Individual level genotype and phenotype data of psychiatric traits (including sleep, anxiety and depression) were all from the UK Biobank (N = 107,947-374,505). We first calculated the polygenic risk scores (PRS) of 62 brain aging modes and 114 gut microbiota taxa as the instrumental variables, and then constructed linear and logistic regression analyses to systematically explore the potential interaction effects of brain aging and gut microbiota on psychiatric disorders. We observed the interaction effects of brain aging and gut microbiota on sleep, anxiety and depression disorders, such as Putamen/caudate T2* vs. Rhodospirillales (β = -0.012, P = 8.4 × 10-4) was negatively associated with chronotype, Fornix MD vs. Holdemanella (β = -0.007, P = 1.76 × 10-2) was negatively related to general anxiety disorder (GAD) scores, and White matter lesions vs. Acidaminococcaceae (β = 0.019, P = 1.29 × 10-3) was positively correlated with self-reported depression. Interestingly, Putamen volume vs. Intestinibacter was associated with all three psychiatric disorders, including chronotype (negative correlation), GAD scores (positive correlation) and self-reported depression (positive correlation). Our study results suggest the significant impacts of brain aging and gut microbiota on the development of sleep, anxiety and depression disorders, providing new clues for clarifying the pathogenesis of these disorders.

## Investigation of fiber utilization in the rumen of dairy cows based on metagenome-assembled genomes and single-cell RNA sequencing.
 21.01.2022, _MY Xue, JJ Wu, YY Xie, SL Zhu, YF Zhong, JX Liu, HZ Sun_


Dairy cows utilize human-inedible, low-value plant biomass to produce milk, a low-cost product with rich nutrients and high proteins. This process largely relies on rumen microbes that ferment lignocellulose and cellulose to produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The VFAs are absorbed and partly metabolized by the stratified squamous rumen epithelium, which is mediated by diverse cell types. Here, we applied a metagenomic binning approach to explore the individual microbes involved in fiber digestion and performed single-cell RNA sequencing on rumen epithelial cells to investigate the cell subtypes contributing to VFA absorption and metabolism.

## The influence of food processing methods on serum parameters, apparent total-tract macronutrient digestibility, fecal microbiota and SCFA content in adult beagles.
 22.01.2022, _X Cai, R Liao, G Chen, Y Lu, Y Zhao, Y Chen_


Food processing methods may influence the health of dogs. However, previous studies have mostly been based on a comparison of several commercial dog foods with different ingredients. In this study, eighteen adult beagles of the same age and health status (assessed by routine blood tests) were used in the experiments. This study analyzed the effects of the following different processing methods: raw, pasteurized, and high temperature sterilization (HTS) made with the same ingredients and nutrients (based on dry matter) on serum parameters, apparent total-tract macronutrient digestibility, fecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content in beagle dogs. The data showed, after a test lasting 56-days, the apparent digestibility (ATTD) of protein and fat in HTS food was 91.9%, which was significantly higher (P&lt; 0.05) than that in dry food (89.2%, P &lt; 0.05). The serum content of triglyceride increased in beagles fed HTS food (P &lt; 0.05), and the number of neutrophils in beagles fed raw food and pasteurized food increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05), and the platelet count in beagles fed raw food showed an increasing trend compared with the beagles fed HTS food. Different processing methods had an impact on the intestinal microbiota and SCFA of beagles; at least 14 genera were significantly affected by the food produced using different processing methods. In particular, the abundance of Allprevotella, Escherichia-Shigella and Turicibacter, and the total acid content were lower in beagles fed the raw diet, whereas Streptococcus, Collinsella, Bacteroides and Ruminococcus gnavus were more abundant following the HTS diet, and Lactococcus showed the highest abundance in beagles fed the pasteurized diet. This study showed that dog food produced by different processing methods affected the health of adult beagles.

## Kaempferol acts on bile acid signaling and gut microbiota to attenuate the tumor burden in ApcMin/+ mice.
 22.01.2022, _X Li, I Khan, G Huang, Y Lu, L Wang, Y Liu, L Lu, WLW Hsiao, Z Liu_


Emerging evidence points to a strong association between the bile acid (BA)-gut microbiota (GM) axis, and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Kaempferol, a common polyphenol in the daily diet, shows various pharmacological activities. However, it remains unclear about the effect of kaempferol on the CRC development and the BA-GM homeostasis. Here, we found kaempferol effectively reduced tumor burden, restored the damaged intestinal barrier and downregulated antigen Ki67 and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) expressions in ApcMin/+ mice. For BA metabolism, kaempferol reversed the decreasing trend in chenodesoxycholic acid (CDCA) and 12α-hydroxylated BAs by increasing the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) and sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) expressions, and upregulated FXR expression. Importantly, molecular docking analysis revealed a direct interaction between kaempferol and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), the mater regulator of BA signaling. For GM analysis, we found higher abundances of species with anticancer properties and lower abundances of species associated with inflammation, obesity, and metabolic disorders in kaempferol-treated groups. Moreover, the gut of kaempferol-treated mice was predominantly colonized by short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and lactic acid producing bacteria. Based on the PICRUSt-predicted pathways of our GM dataset, we demonstrated that kaempferol downregulated secondary BA synthesis pathways, increased G protein-coupled receptor activity and decreased NOD-like receptor activity, affecting cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. Collectively, these results reveal that kaempferol effectively attenuates the tumor burden in ApcMin/+ mice by modulating the BA signaling and GM homeostasis.
