Perinatal factors can shape fecal microbiome patterns among pregnant women and their infants. However, there is scarce information about the effect of maternal demographics and perinatal exposures on antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and mobile genetic element (MGE) patterns in pregnant women and infants. We examined fecal samples from pregnant women during their third trimester of pregnancy (n = 51) and 6-month-old infants (n = 40). Of the 91 participants, 72 represented 36 maternal-infant dyads, 15 were additional pregnant women, and 4 were additional infants. We assessed the effects of demographics, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking and parity in the pregnancy resistome and the effects of demographics, delivery mode, feeding habits and prenatal antibiotic treatment on the infancy resistome. ARG and MGE richness and abundance were assessed using a SmartChip qPCR-array. Alpha diversity (Shannon and Inverse Simpson index) and beta diversity (Sorensen and Bray-Curtis index) were calculated. The Wilcoxon and the Kruskal non-parametric test were used for comparisons. There is a high variability in shared resistome patterns between pregnant women and their infants. An average of 29% of ARG and 24% of MGE were shared within dyads. Infants had significantly greater abundance and higher diversity of ARG and MGE compared to pregnant women. Pregnancy and infancy samples differed in ARG and MGE gene composition and structure. Composition of the fecal resistome was significantly associated with race in pregnant women, with non-white women having different patterns than white women, and, in infants, with extent of solid food consumption. Our data showed that the pregnancy and infancy resistome had different structure and composition patterns, with maternal race and infant solid food consumption as possible contributors to ARG. By characterizing resistome patterns, our results can inform the mechanism of antibiotic resistome development in pregnant women and their infants.

## Revealing links between gut microbiome and its fungal community in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus among Emirati subjects: A pilot study.
 19.06.2020, _MT Al Bataineh, NR Dash, PB Lassen, BH Banimfreg, AM Nada, E Belda, K Clément_


Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) drastically affects the population of Middle East countries with an ever-increasing number of overweight and obese individuals. The precise links between T2DM and gut microbiome composition remain elusive in these populations. Here, we performed 16 S rRNA and ITS2- gene based microbial profiling of 50 stool samples from Emirati adults with or without T2DM. The four major enterotypes initially described in westernized cohorts were retrieved in this Emirati population. T2DM and non-T2DM healthy controls had different microbiome compositions, with an enrichment in Prevotella enterotype in non-T2DM controls whereas T2DM individuals had a higher proportion of the dysbiotic Bacteroides 2 enterotype. No significant differences in microbial diversity were observed in T2DM individuals after controlling for cofounding factors, contrasting with reports from westernized cohorts. Interestingly, fungal diversity was significantly decreased in Bacteroides 2 enterotype. Functional profiling from 16 S rRNA gene data showed marked differences between T2DM and non-T2DM controls, with an enrichment in amino acid degradation and LPS-related modules in T2DM individuals, whereas non-T2DM controls had increased abundance of carbohydrate degradation modules in concordance with enterotype composition. These differences provide an insight into gut microbiome composition in Emirati population and its potential role in the development of diabetes mellitus.

## Effects of Drinking Water Temperature and Flow Rate during Cold Season on Growth Performance, Nutrient Digestibility and Cecum Microflora of Weaned Piglets.
 23.06.2020, _Z Zhang, Z Li, H Zhao, X Chen, G Tian, G Liu, J Cai, G Jia_


Although water is one of the most important nutrients and is essential for various physiological processes within the body, it does not receive adequate consideration when ensuring optimal nutrition and growth performance in piglets. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of drinking water temperature (DWT) and flow rate (DWF) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and cecum microflora in weaned piglets during cold weather. Sixty-four piglets with an average body weight of 8.60 ± 0.5 kg were allotted into four groups with four replicates in each group and four pigs in each replicate. The DWT and DWF were set for each group as follows: (1) 13 °C + 300 mL/min, (2) 13 °C + 700 mL/min, (3) 30 °C + 300 mL/min and (4) 30 °C + 700 mL/min, respectively. All groups were fed the same diet during the 28 d trial. The body weight at day 0 and day 29, as well as daily feed intake, were recorded. Diarrhea severity was assessed every day. Fresh fecal samples were collected for four consecutive days at the end of the experiment for the digestibility test. Cecum content was collected after sacrifice for microbial composition analysis. The results indicated that: (1) DWT at 30 °C promoted the average daily gain (ADG) of weaned piglets considerably (p = 0.043) and decreased feed to weight ratio when compared with DWT at 13 °C (p = 0.045). DWF had no substantial effect on the growth performance of piglets (p &gt; 0.05). (2) The 30 °C DWT groups had higher apparent digestibility of crude protein, crude fat and energy than the 13 °C DWT groups (p &lt; 0.05), while DWF had no significant effect on the apparent digestibility of nutrients (p &gt; 0.05). (3) DWT at 30 °C increased the Bacteroidetes abundance and decreased the Proteobacteria abundance in cecum digesta. The change in these two factors may be related to a decrease in diarrhea and the improvement of growth performance. Different DWF had no substantial effect on the cecum microbial structure. To sum up, providing a DWT of 30 °C to weaned piglets in cold weather reduced the abundance of harmful bacteria in the cecum and improved the apparent nutrient digestibility, which is beneficial for maintaining a healthy intestinal microenvironment and promoting growth performance. A lower DWF of 300 mL/min had no adverse effect on growth performance. Therefore, a combination of 30 °C + 300 mL/min is recommended for weaned piglets during cold weather for the consideration of animal welfare and production efficiency.

## Evaluating the association between feed efficiency and the fecal microbiota of early-life Duroc pigs using 16S rRNA sequencing.

Improving the predication efficiency of porcine production performance at early stage will contribute to reducing the breeding and production costs. The intestinal microbiota had received plenty of attention in recent years due to their influence on host health and performance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the fecal microbiota at early growth period and porcine feed efficiency (FE) under a commercial feeding environment. Ninety-one pigs were reordered according to the residual feed intake (RFI) values between day 90 on test and day 160 off test, 9 lowest RFI pigs and 9 highest RFI pigs were selected as the LRFI group and the HRFI group, respectively. Fecal samples from pigs in the early grower phase (day 80) were performed for microbial diversity, composition, and predicted functionality by using 16S rRNA sequencing. The results showed that no significant differences in microbial alpha diversity were observed between two RFI groups, whereas, some RFI-associated compositional differences were revealed. In particular, the microbiota of the LRFI group (more feed-efficient) had significantly higher levels of some members of Clostridiales and Bacteroidales (e.g., g_1_68 and g_norank_f_p_2534_18B5), which may promoted FE through protecting gut barrier function, compared with those of the HRFI pigs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis found that the LRFI pigs were likely have microbiota with higher levels of amino acid metabolism. Moreover, redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that litter size, parity, and date of birth had significant effects on the bacterial community structure. These results improved our knowledge of the porcine early-life fecal microbiota and its potential link underlying RFI, which would be useful for future development of microbial biomarkers for predicting and improving porcine FE as well as investigation of targets for dietary strategies.

## Establishment and Stability of the Murine Oral Microbiome.
 04.06.2020, _L Abusleme, H O'Gorman, N Dutzan, T Greenwell-Wild, NM Moutsopoulos_


Commensal microbiomes exert critical functions at barrier sites. In particular, establishment of the commensal microbiome after birth dictates immune functionality and tissue homeostasis at mucosal surfaces. To investigate the establishment and stability of the oral mucosal microbiome in mice, we evaluated oral microbiome communities shortly after birth, through adulthood, and up to 1 y of life in a controlled manner, using sequential oral samples from the same mice over time. We further evaluated transmissibility of oral microbiomes from parents and during cohousing experiments and evaluated susceptibility to oral inflammatory disease in mice harboring distinct microbiomes. Our work reveals basic principles in the establishment and stability of a health-associated oral microbiome after birth and provides insights that may be important for host-microbiome experimentation in animal models.
