In recent years, there has been increasing attention towards understanding the relationship between age-related alterations in the oral microbiota and age-associated diseases, with reports emphasizing the significance of maintaining a balanced oral microbiota for host health. However, the precise mechanisms underlying age-related changes in the oral microbiota remain elusive. We recently reported that cellular senescence of ileal germinal center (GC) B cells, triggered by the persistent presence of commensal bacteria, results in diminished IgA production with aging and subsequent alterations in the gut microbiota. Consequently, we hypothesize that a similar phenomenon may occur in the oral cavity, potentially contributing to age-related changes in the oral microbiota. Examination of p16-luc mice, wherein the expression of the senescent cell marker p16INK4a can be visualized, raised under specific pathogen-free (SPF) or germ-free (GF) conditions, indicated that, unlike ileal GC B cells, the accumulation of senescent cells in GC B cells of cervical lymph nodes increases with age regardless of the presence of commensal bacteria. Furthermore, longitudinal studies utilizing the same individual mice throughout their lifespan revealed concurrent age-related alterations in the composition of the oral microbiota and a decline in salivary IgA secretion. Further investigation involving Rag1-/- mice transplanted with B cells from wild-type or p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 -double knockout mice unveiled that B cell senescence leads to reduced IgA secretion and alteration of the oral microbiota. These findings advance our understanding of the mechanism of age-associated changes in the oral microbiota and open up possibilities of their control.

Understanding the determinants of long-term liver metastasis (LM) outcomes in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients is crucial. We established the feature selection model of intratumoral microbiome at the surgery, achieving robust predictive accuracies of 0.953 and 0.897 AUCs in discovery (n = 74) and validation (n = 34) cohorts, respectively. Notably, despite the significant reduction in LM occurrence with adjuvant imatinib (AI) treatment, intratumoral microbiome exerted independently stronger effects on post-operative LM. Employing both 16S and full-length rRNA sequencing, we pinpoint intracellular Shewanella algae as a foremost LM risk factor in both AI- and non-AI-treated patients. Experimental validation confirmed S. algae's intratumoral presence in GIST, along with migration/invasion-promoting effects on GIST cells. Furthermore, S. algae promoted LM and impeded AI treatment in metastatic mouse models. Our findings advocate for incorporating intratumoral microbiome evaluation at surgery, and propose S. algae as a therapeutic target for LM suppression in GIST.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of the composition of the dominant groups of vaginal microorganisms in healthy pregnant women and pregnant women infected with HPV using a microbiological culture-based method. The MALDI TOF MS method and 16S rRNA gene fragment sequencing were used to identify microorganisms isolated from healthy pregnant women (n=32) and pregnant women infected with HPV (n=24). It was found that vaginal secretion samples from both groups contained bacteria of 4 phyla: Bacillota, Actinomycetota, Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, and Ascomycota fungi. The most common microbial community in healthy pregnant women being CST I (p=0.0007), and CST V in pregnant women infected with HPV (p=0.0001). At the genus level, a total of 25 taxa were found in all samples, with Lactobacillus being the dominant genus overall. Escherichia (p&lt;0.0001) and Prevotella (p=0.0001) concentrations were higher in HPV infected patients. When calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient for the phyla, it was found that Bacillota correlated negatively with HPV genotypes 16 and 51 (p≤0.05), but positively with HPV genotype 59 (p≤0.05), just like Actinomycetota (p≤0.05). Bacteroidota correlated positively with HPV genotype 56 (0.001&lt;p&lt;0.01), and Ascomycota correlated positively with HPV genotypes 39 and 51 (p≤0.05; 0.001&lt;p&lt;0.01). Pearson correlation coefficients between bacteria genera and HPV genotypes were statistically significant for the following genera: Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gardnerella, Escherichia, Prevotella. The data obtained in our study indicates that the culture-based method is informative when assessing the qualitative and quantitative composition of the microbiota.

## The gut-microbiome in adult Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - A Meta-analysis.
 09.08.2024, _B Jakobi, P Vlaming, D Mulder, M Ribases, V Richarte, JA Ramos-Quiroga, I Tendolkar, P van Eijndhoven, JN Vrijsen, J Buitelaar, B Franke, M Hoogman, M Bloemendaal, A Arias-Vasquez_


Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that persists into adulthood in the majority of individuals. While the gut-microbiome seems to be relevant for ADHD, the few publications on gut-microbial alterations in ADHD are inconsistent, in the investigated phenotypes, sequencing method/region, preprocessing, statistical approaches, and findings. To identify gut-microbiome alterations in adult ADHD, robust across studies and statistical approaches, we harmonized bioinformatic pipelines and analyses of raw 16S rRNA sequencing data from four adult ADHD case-control studies (NADHD=312, NNoADHD=305). We investigated diversity and differential abundance of selected genera (logistic regression and ANOVA-like Differential Expression tool), corrected for age and sex, and meta-analyzed the study results. Converging results were investigated for association with hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptoms across all participants. Beta diversity was associated with ADHD diagnosis but showed significant heterogeneity between cohorts, despite harmonized analyses. Several genera were robustly associated with adult ADHD; e.g., Ruminococcus_torques_group (LogOdds=0.17, pfdr=4.42 × 10-2), which was more abundant in adults with ADHD, and Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group (LogOdds= -0.12, pfdr=6.9 × 10-3), which was less abundant in ADHD. Ruminococcus_torques_group was further associated with hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and Eisenbergiella with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (pfdr&lt;0.05). The literature points towards a role of these genera in inflammatory processes. Irreproducible results in the field of gut-microbiota research, due to between study heterogeneity and small sample sizes, stress the need for meta-analytic approaches and large sample sizes. While we robustly identified genera associated with adult ADHD, that might overall be considered beneficial or risk-conferring, functional studies are needed to shed light on these properties.

The critical role of the human gut microbiota in kidney stone formation remains largely unknown, due to the low taxonomic resolution of previous sequencing technologies. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the gut microbiota using high-throughput sequencing to provide valuable insights and identify potential bacterial species and metabolite roles involved in kidney stone formation. The overall gut bacterial community and its potential functions in healthy participants and patients were examined using PacBio sequencing targeting the full-length 16S rRNA gene, coupled with stone and statistical analyses. Most kidney stones comprised calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate (75%), pure calcium oxalate (20%), and calcium phosphate and magnesium phosphate (5%), with higher content of Ca (130,510.5 ± 108,362.7 ppm) followed by P (18,746.4 ± 23,341.2 ppm). The microbial community structure was found to be weaker in patients' kidney stone samples, followed by patients' stool samples, than in healthy participants' stool samples. The most abundant bacterial species in kidney stone samples was uncultured Morganella, whereas that in patient and healthy participant stool samples was Bacteroides vulgatus. Similarly, Akkermansia muciniphila was significantly enriched in patient stool samples at the species level, whereas Bacteroides plebeius was significantly enriched in kidney stone samples than that in healthy participant stool samples. Three microbial metabolic pathways, TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and urea cycle, were significantly enriched in kidney stone patients compared to healthy participants. Inferring bacteria at the species level revealed key players in kidney stone formation, enhancing the clinical relevance of gut microbiota.

## Game of microbes: the battle within - gut microbiota and multiple sclerosis.
 12.08.2024, _TA Turner, P Lehman, S Ghimire, SK Shahi, A Mangalam_


_Multiple Sclerosis, Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Dysbiosis, Animals, Bacteria_
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to the pathobiology of the disease. While human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have emerged as the strongest genetic factor, consensus on environmental risk factors are lacking. Recently, trillions of microbes residing in our gut (microbiome) have emerged as a potential environmental factor linked with the pathobiology of MS as PwMS show gut microbial dysbiosis (altered gut microbiome). Thus, there has been a strong emphasis on understanding the factors (host and environmental) regulating the composition of the gut microbiota and the mechanism(s) through which gut microbes contribute to MS disease, especially through immune system modulation. A better understanding of these interactions will help harness the enormous potential of the gut microbiota as a therapeutic approach to treating MS.

## Gut mycobiome alterations and implications for liver diseases.
 10.08.2024, _S Zeng, B Schnabl_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Liver Diseases, Mycobiome, Dysbiosis, Animals, Fungi_
Chronic liver disease and its complications are a significant global health burden. Changes in fungal communities (mycobiome), an integral component of the gut microbiome, are associated with and contribute to the development of liver disease. Fungal dysbiosis can induce intestinal barrier dysfunction and allow fungal products to translocate to the liver causing progression of disease. This review explores recent progress in understanding the compositional and functional diversity of gut mycobiome signatures across different liver diseases. It delves into causative connections between gut fungi and liver diseases. We emphasize the significance of fungal translocation, with a particular focus on fungal-derived metabolites and immune cells induced by fungi, as key contributors to liver disease. Furthermore, we review the potential impact of the intrahepatic mycobiome on the progression of liver diseases.

## A novel intervention of molecular hydrogen on the unbalance of the gut microbiome in opioid addiction: Experimental and human studies.
 08.08.2024, _B Xie, Y Wang, Y Lu, M Wang, R Hui, H Yu, W Li, L Zhang, F Yu, Z Ni, B Cong, C Ma, D Wen_


The gut-brain axis mediates the interaction pathway between microbiota and opioid addiction. In recent years, many studies have shown that molecular hydrogen has therapeutic and preventive effects on various diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether molecular hydrogen could serve as pharmacological intervention agent to reduce risks of reinstatement of opioid seeking and explore the mechanism of gut microbiota base on animal experiments and human studies. Morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) was constructed to establish acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement stage, and the potential impact of H2 on the behaviors related to morphine-induced drug extinction was determined using both free accessible and confined CPP extinction paradigms. The effects of morphine on microbial diversity and composition of microbiota, as well as the subsequent changes after H2 intervention, were assessed using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) in mice serum were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Meanwhile, we also conducted molecular hydrogen intervention and gut microbiota testing in opioid-addicted individuals. Our results revealed that molecular hydrogen could enhance the extinction of morphine-related behavior, reducing morphine reinstatement. Gut microbes may be a potential mechanism behind the therapeutic effects of molecular hydrogen on morphine addiction. Additionally, molecular hydrogen improved symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as gut microbial features, in individuals with opioid addiction. This study supports molecular hydrogen as a novel and effective intervention for morphine-induced addiction and reveals the mechanism of gut microbiota.
