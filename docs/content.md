## Non-zero-sum microbiome immune system interactions.
 09.07.2021, _T Tuganbaev, K Honda_


Fundamental asymmetries between the host and its microbiome in enzymatic activities and nutrient storage capabilities have promoted mutualistic adaptations on both sides. As a result, the enteric immune system has evolved so as not to cause a zero-sum sterilization of non-self, but rather achieve a non-zero-sum self-reinforcing cooperation with its evolutionary partner the microbiome. In this review we attempt to integrate the accumulated knowledge of immune - microbiome interactions into an evolutionary framework and trace the pattern of positive immune - microbiome feedback loops across epithelial, enteric nervous system, innate and adaptive immune circuits. Indeed, the immune system requires commensal signals for its development and function, and reciprocally protects the microbiome from nutrient shortage and pathogen outgrowth. In turn, a healthy microbiome is the result of immune system curatorship as well as microbial ecology. The paradigms of host-microbiome asymmetry and the cooperative nature of their interactions identified in the gut are applicable across all tissues influenced by microbial activities. Incorporation of immune system influences into models of microbiome ecology will be a step forward towards defining what constitutes a healthy human microbiome and guide discoveries of novel host-microbiome mutualistic adaptations that may be harnessed for promotion of human health.

## Intersection of FcγRIIB, the microbiome, and checkpoint inhibitors in antitumor immunity.
 09.07.2021, _KM Baecher, ML Ford_


Fc receptors (FcRs) and the microbiome are both known to have an effect on the development and progression of cancers. Checkpoint inhibitors are a novel class of therapeutics which are used to combat cancer and are integrally linked to both FcRs and the microbiome. The use of checkpoint inhibitors has grown exponentially over the past decade, although many host factors affect both the efficacy and the safety of these therapeutics. Some of these host factors, including the microbiome and the expression of FcRs, are currently being investigated. Here we discuss the current understanding of FcRs (particularly the inhibitory FcγRIIB) and the microbiome in context of T cell immunity, inflammation, cancer, and checkpoint inhibition.

## Evaluating extraction methods to study canine urine microbiota.
 09.07.2021, _R Mrofchak, C Madden, MV Evans, VL Hale_


The urinary microbiota is the collection of microbes present in urine that may play a role in host health. Studies of urine microbiota have traditionally relied upon culturing methods aimed at identifying pathogens. However, recent culture-free sequencing studies of the urine microbiota have determined that a diverse array of microbes is present in health and disease. To study these microbes and their potential role in diseases like bladder cancer or interstitial cystitis, consistent extraction and detection of bacterial DNA from urine is critical. However, urine is a low biomass substrate, requiring sensitive methods to capture DNA and making the risk of contamination high. To address this challenge, we collected urine samples from ten healthy dogs and extracted DNA from each sample using five different commercially available extraction methods. Extraction methods were compared based on total and bacterial DNA concentrations and bacterial community composition and diversity assessed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Significant differences in the urinary microbiota were observed by dog and sex but not extraction method. The Bacteremia Kit yielded the highest total DNA concentrations (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.165, not significant) and the highest bacterial DNA concentrations (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.044). Bacteremia also extracted bacterial DNA from the greatest number of samples. Taken together, these results suggest that the Bacteremia kit is an effective option for studying the urine microbiota. This work lays the foundation to study the urine microbiome in a wide range of urogenital diseases in dogs and other species.

## The potential of outdoor environments to supply beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria to humans.
 28.05.2021, _JE Brame, C Liddicoat, CA Abbott, MF Breed_

Butyrate is an important mediator of human health and disease. The mechanisms of action of butyrate are becoming increasingly well-known. Many commensal bacteria that inhabit the human gut can synthesise butyrate, which is then absorbed into the human host. Simultaneously, several immune- and inflammatory-mediated diseases are being linked to insufficient exposure to beneficial microbes from our environment, including butyrate-producing bacteria. However, the role of outdoor environmental exposure to butyrate-producing bacteria remains poorly understood. Here we review the literature on the human exposure pathways to butyrate-producing bacteria, with a particular focus on outdoor environmental sources (e.g. associated with plants, plant-based residues, and soil), and the health implications of exposure to them. Emerging evidence suggests that environmental butyrate-producers may help supplement the human gut microbiota and represent an important component of the Biodiversity and Old Friends hypotheses. Improving our understanding of potential sources, precursors, and exposure pathways of environmental butyrate-producers that influence the gut microbiota and butyrate production offers promise to advance multiple disciplines of health and environmental science. We outline research priorities to address knowledge gaps in the outdoor environment-butyrate-health nexus and build knowledge of the potential pathways to help optimise exposure to human-beneficial butyrate-producing bacteria from the outdoor environment during childhood and adulthood.

## Gut microbiome heritability is nearly universal but environmentally contingent.

Relatives have more similar gut microbiomes than nonrelatives, but the degree to which this similarity results from shared genotypes versus shared environments has been controversial. Here, we leveraged 16,234 gut microbiome profiles, collected over 14 years from 585 wild baboons, to reveal that host genetic effects on the gut microbiome are nearly universal. Controlling for diet, age, and socioecological variation, 97% of microbiome phenotypes were significantly heritable, including several reported as heritable in humans. Heritability was typically low (mean = 0.068) but was systematically greater in the dry season, with low diet diversity, and in older hosts. We show that longitudinal profiles and large sample sizes are crucial to quantifying microbiome heritability, and indicate scope for selection on microbiome characteristics as a host phenotype.

## Isoflavone diet ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis through modulation of gut bacteria depleted in patients with multiple sclerosis.
 10.07.2021, _SN Jensen, NM Cady, SK Shahi, SR Peterson, A Gupta, KN Gibson-Corley, AK Mangalam_


The gut microbiota is a potential environmental factor that influences the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). We and others have demonstrated that patients with MS and healthy individuals have distinct gut microbiomes. However, the pathogenic relevance of these differences remains unclear. Previously, we showed that bacteria that metabolize isoflavones are less abundant in patients with MS, suggesting that isoflavone-metabolizing bacteria might provide protection against MS. Here, using a mouse model of MS, we report that an isoflavone diet provides protection against disease, which is dependent on the presence of isoflavone-metabolizing bacteria and their metabolite equol. Notably, the composition of the gut microbiome in mice fed an isoflavone diet exhibited parallels to healthy human donors, whereas the composition in those fed an isoflavone-free diet exhibited parallels to patients with MS. Collectively, our study provides evidence that dietary-induced gut microbial changes alleviate disease severity and may contribute to MS pathogenesis.
