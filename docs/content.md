This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Thermally enhanced biodegradation of benzo[a]pyrene and benzene co-contaminated soil: Bioavailability and generation of ROS.
 12.05.2023, _M Ali, X Song, Q Wang, Z Zhang, M Zhang, X Chen, Z Tang, X Liu_


In this study, a set of comprehensive experiments were conducted to explore the effects of temperature on the biodegradation, bioavailability, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by thermally enhanced biodegradation (TEB) under benzene and BaP co-contaminated conditions. The biodegradation rates of benzene increased from 57.4% to 88.7% and 84.9%, and the biodegradation efficiency of BaP was enhanced from 15.8% to 34.6% and 28.6%, when the temperature was raised from the ambient temperature of 15 °C to 45 °C and 30 °C, respectively. In addition, the bioavailability analysis results demonstrated that the water- and butanol-extractable BaP increased with elevated temperatures. High enzymatic activities and PAH-RHDα gene in gram-positive bacteria favored the long-term elevated temperatures (30 and 45 °C) compared to gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, ROS species (O2•- and •OH) generation was detected which were scavenged by the increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities at elevated temperatures. Soil properties (pH, TOC, moisture, total iron, Fe3+, and Fe2+) were affected by the temperature treatments, revealing that metal-organic-associated reactions occurred during the TEB of benzene-BaP co-contamination. The results concluded that biodegradation of benzene-BaP co-contamination was greatly improved at 45 °C and that microbial activities enhanced the biodegradation under TEB via the increased bioavailability and generation and degradation of ROS.

Microplastic pollution of the ocean has received extensive attention as plastic pollution increases globally, but the potential ecological risks caused by microplastic interactions with trace metals still require further research. In this study, Apostichopus japonicus was used to explore the individual and combined toxicities of cadmium (Cd) and microplastics and their effects on growth, Cd tissue accumulation, digestive enzymes, and gut microbes. The body weight gain and specific growth rate of animals exposed to a combination of high concentrations of Cd and microplastics decreased. The addition of high concentrations of cadmium to the diet led to an increase in cadmium content in the respiratory tree, digestive tract and body wall. Amylase, lipase and trypsin decreased to different degrees in the group treated with high concentrations of Cd/microplastics. Firmicutes were significantly reduced across multiple treatment groups, with the order Lactobacillales being the most significantly affected. Cd is the pollutant causing the greatest negative impact, but the presence of microplastics undoubtedly increases its toxicity.

## Key determinants of success in fecal microbiota transplantation: From microbiome to clinic.
 11.05.2023, _S Porcari, N Benech, M Valles-Colomer, N Segata, A Gasbarrini, G Cammarota, H Sokol, G Ianiro_


Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has achieved satisfactory results in preventing the recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection, but these positive outcomes have only been partially replicated in other diseases. Several factors influence FMT success, including those related to donors and recipients (including diversity and specific composition of the gut microbiome, immune system, and host genetics) as well as to working protocols (fecal amount and number of infusions, route of delivery, and adjuvant treatments). Moreover, initial evidence suggests that the clinical success of FMT may be related to the degree of donor microbial engraftment. The application of cutting-edge technologies for microbiome assessment, along with changes in the current vision of fecal transplants, are expected to improve FMT protocols and outcomes. Here, we review the key determinants of FMT success and insights and strategies that will enable a close integration of lab-based and clinical approaches for increasing FMT success.

## Profiling the human intestinal environment under physiological conditions.

The spatiotemporal structure of the human microbiome1,2, proteome3 and metabolome4,5 reflects and determines regional intestinal physiology and may have implications for disease6. Yet, little is known about the distribution of microorganisms, their environment and their biochemical activity in the gut because of reliance on stool samples and limited access to only some regions of the gut using endoscopy in fasting or sedated individuals7. To address these deficiencies, we developed an ingestible device that collects samples from multiple regions of the human intestinal tract during normal digestion. Collection of 240 intestinal samples from 15 healthy individuals using the device and subsequent multi-omics analyses identified significant differences between bacteria, phages, host proteins and metabolites in the intestines versus stool. Certain microbial taxa were differentially enriched and prophage induction was more prevalent in the intestines than in stool. The host proteome and bile acid profiles varied along the intestines and were highly distinct from those of stool. Correlations between gradients in bile acid concentrations and microbial abundance predicted species that altered the bile acid pool through deconjugation. Furthermore, microbially conjugated bile acid concentrations exhibited amino acid-dependent trends that were not apparent in stool. Overall, non-invasive, longitudinal profiling of microorganisms, proteins and bile acids along the intestinal tract under physiological conditions can help elucidate the roles of the gut microbiome and metabolome in human physiology and disease.

## Interaction between gut microbiota and sex hormones and their relation to sexual dimorphism in metabolic diseases.
 24.02.2023, _JA Santos-Marcos, M Mora-Ortiz, M Tena-Sempere, J Lopez-Miranda, A Camargo_


_Humans, Male, Female, Sex Characteristics, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Gonadal Steroid Hormones, Metabolic Syndrome, Obesity_
Metabolic diseases, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), are now a widespread pandemic in the developed world. These pathologies show sex differences in their development and prevalence, and sex steroids, mainly estrogen and testosterone, are thought to play a prominent role in this sexual dimorphism. The influence of sex hormones on these pathologies is not only reflected in differences between men and women, but also between women themselves, depending on the hormonal changes associated with the menopause. The observed sex differences in gut microbiota composition have led to multiple studies highlighting the interaction between steroid hormones and the gut microbiota and its influence on metabolic diseases, ultimately pointing to a new therapy for these diseases based on the manipulation of the gut microbiota. This review aims to shed light on the role of sexual hormones in sex differences in the development and prevalence of metabolic diseases, focusing on obesity, MetS and T2D. We focus also the interaction between sex hormones and the gut microbiota, and in particular the role of microbiota in aspects such as gut barrier integrity, inflammatory status, and the gut-brain axis, given the relevance of these factors in the development of metabolic diseases.

## Effects of dietary polyherbal mixtures on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immune function and jejunal health of yellow-feathered broilers.
 12.05.2023, _M Liu, J Zhou, Y Li, Y Ding, J Lian, Q Dong, Q Qu, W Lv, S Guo_


This study aimed to investigate the effects of polyherbal mixtures (PHM) on growth performance, antioxidant capacities, immune function, and intestinal health in yellow-feathered broilers. PHM is composed of five traditional Chinese medicine herbs (Portulaca oleracea L., Radix Sophora flavescens, Thalictrum glandulosissimum, Terra flava usta, and Pogostemon cablin). A total of 270 one-day-old yellow-feathered broilers were randomly allotted into 3 treatments for a 42-d feeding trial, each with 6 replicates of 15 birds. The dietary treatments consisted of a basal diet (CON), a basal diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg chlortetracycline (CTC), and a basal diet supplemented with 1000 mg/kg PHM. The results showed that dietary PHM supplementation increased body weight, ADG, and decreased F/G compared to the CON. PHM also increased spleen index and mRNA expression of IL-4 (d 21), and thymus index, serum IgA (d 42) and IgG, IL-4 and sIgA in jejunal mucosa (d 21 and 42), but decreased serum IFN-γ and mRNA expression of IFN-γ (d 21 and 42). In addition, PHM increased serum SOD, GSH-Px (d 21 and 42) and T-AOC (d 42), but decreased the content of serum MDA (d 21), the up-regulated mRNA expression of GSH-Px, CAT (d 21), SOD and CAT (d 42). Furthermore, PHM also improved the intestinal epithelial barrier indicators by the up-regulated mRNA expression of CLDN-1, OCLN (d 21 and 42) and ZO-1 (d 21), and the increased of villus height and villus height to crypt depth in jejunum (d 42). The high-throughput sequencing results showed that dietary PHM supplementation increased the alpha diversity and relative abundance of Oscillospira and Ruminococcus (d 21) and Lactobacillus (d 42), whereas decreasing that of Enterococcus (d 21) compared with CON. PICRUSt analysis revealed that metabolic pathways of carbohydrate, energy, lipid, cofactors, and vitamins were significantly enriched in the PHM group. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that the genera Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Ruminococcus, Oscillospira, and Faecalibacterium were related to growth performance, intestinal integrity, immune-related factors, antioxidant indices, and tight junction proteins. In conclusion, the results indicated that dietary PHM supplementation improved growth performance and immune status of yellow-feathered broilers by enhancing antioxidant capacities, barrier function, and modulated jejunal microbial communities. PHM used in our study has the potential to replace prophylactic antibiotic use in poultry production systems.
