Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump.

## Disruption of the intestinal clock drives dysbiosis and impaired barrier function in colorectal cancer.

Diet is a robust entrainment cue that regulates diurnal rhythms of the gut microbiome. We and others have shown that disruption of the circadian clock drives the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). While certain bacterial species have been suggested to play driver roles in CRC, it is unknown whether the intestinal clock impinges on the microbiome to accelerate CRC pathogenesis. To address this, genetic disruption of the circadian clock, in an Apc-driven mouse model of CRC, was used to define the impact on the gut microbiome. When clock disruption is combined with CRC, metagenomic sequencing identified dysregulation of many bacterial genera including Bacteroides, Helicobacter, and Megasphaera. We identify functional changes to microbial pathways including dysregulated nucleic acid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as disruption of intestinal barrier function. Our findings suggest that clock disruption impinges on microbiota composition and intestinal permeability that may contribute to CRC pathogenesis.

## Making waves: From tap to gut- exploring the impact of drinking water on gut microbiota.
 28.09.2024, _HS Moghaddam, L Abkar, SJ Fowler_


Drinking water (DW) harbours diverse microbial species and chemical attributes. Water comprises the greatest portion of our daily diet, ingested both on its own and used in the preparation of food. DW is our major source of liquids, which is vital to maintaining homeostasis, and can also supply essential minerals. Limited evidence suggests that DW plays a role in shaping the gut microbiome, which implies that it may impact human health. Despite its significant contribution to diet, DW is often overlooked in studies examining dietary influences on the gut microbiota. This perspective explores our current understanding of the link between DW and the gut microbiota - an area of human microbiome science that has been surprisingly understudied. Existing studies reveal links between DW source, microbiota composition, and gut health, emphasizing the need for comprehensive investigations. Understanding the interplay between DW and gut microbiota holds potential for tailored interventions to enhance human health.

## Taxometer: Improving taxonomic classification of metagenomics contigs.
 30.09.2024, _S Kutuzova, M Nielsen, P Piera, JN Nissen, S Rasmussen_


_Metagenomics, Software, Neural Networks, Computer, Classification, Metagenome, Algorithms, Contig Mapping, Rhizosphere_
For taxonomy based classification of metagenomics assembled contigs, current methods use sequence similarity to identify their most likely taxonomy. However, in the related field of metagenomic binning, contigs are routinely clustered using information from both the contig sequences and their abundance. We introduce Taxometer, a neural network based method that improves the annotations and estimates the quality of any taxonomic classifier using contig abundance profiles and tetra-nucleotide frequencies. We apply Taxometer to five short-read CAMI2 datasets and find that it increases the average share of correct species-level contig annotations of the MMSeqs2 tool from 66.6% to 86.2%. Additionally, it reduce the share of wrong species-level annotations in the CAMI2 Rhizosphere dataset by an average of two-fold for Metabuli, Centrifuge, and Kraken2. Futhermore, we use Taxometer for benchmarking taxonomic classifiers on two complex long-read metagenomics data sets where ground truth is not known. Taxometer is available as open-source software and can enhance any taxonomic annotation of metagenomic contigs.
