## The SAMBA tool uses long reads to improve the contiguity of genome assemblies.
 04.02.2022, _AV Zimin, SL Salzberg_


Third-generation sequencing technologies can generate very long reads with relatively high error rates. The lengths of the reads, which sometimes exceed one million bases, make them invaluable for resolving complex repeats that cannot be assembled using shorter reads. Many high-quality genome assemblies have already been produced, curated, and annotated using the previous generation of sequencing data, and full re-assembly of these genomes with long reads is not always practical or cost-effective. One strategy to upgrade existing assemblies is to generate additional coverage using long-read data, and add that to the previously assembled contigs. SAMBA is a tool that is designed to scaffold and gap-fill existing genome assemblies with additional long-read data, resulting in substantially greater contiguity. SAMBA is the only tool of its kind that also computes and fills in the sequence for all spanned gaps in the scaffolds, yielding much longer contigs. Here we compare SAMBA to several similar tools capable of re-scaffolding assemblies using long-read data, and we show that SAMBA yields better contiguity and introduces fewer errors than competing methods. SAMBA is open-source software that is distributed at https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca.

## 'A landmark in psychiatric progress'? The role of evidence in the rise and fall of insulin coma therapy.
 22.12.2021, _R Freudenthal, J Moncrieff_


This paper examines the evidence behind the use and decline of insulin coma therapy as a treatment for schizophrenia and how this was viewed by the psychiatric profession. The paper demonstrates that, from the time of its introduction, there was considerable debate regarding the evidence for insulin treatment, and scepticism about its purported benefits. The randomized trials conducted in the 1950s were the result, rather than the origins, of this debate. Although insulin treatment was subsequently abandoned, it was still regarded as a historic moment in the modernization of psychiatry. Then, as now, evidence does not speak for itself, and insulin continued to be incorporated into the story of psychiatric progress even after it was shown to be ineffective.

## Dynamic of the human gut microbiome under infectious diarrhea.
 05.02.2022, _H Chung The, SH Le_


Despite the widespread implementation of sanitation, immunization and appropriate treatment, infectious diarrheal diseases still inflict a great health burden to children living in low resource settings. Conventional microbiology research in diarrhea have focused on the pathogen's biology and pathogenesis, but initial enteric infections could trigger subsequent perturbations in the gut microbiome, leading to short-term or long-term health effects. Conversely, such pre-existing perturbations could render children more vulnerable to enteropathogen colonization and diarrhea. Recent advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses have been integrated in well-designed clinical and epidemiological studies, which allow us to track how the gut microbiome changes from disease onset to recovery. Here, we aim to summarize the current understanding on the diarrheal gut microbiome, stratified into different disease stages. Furthermore, we discuss how such perturbations could have impacts beyond an acute diarrhea episode, specifically on the child's nutritional status and the facilitation of antimicrobial resistance.

## Mechanism of Dyspnea during Exercise in Children with Corrected Congenital Heart Disease.
 24.01.2022, _M Chlif, MM Ammar, NB Said, L Sergey, S Ahmaidi, F Alassery, H Hamam_


_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## BIOME-Preserve: A novel storage and transport medium for preserving anaerobic microbiota samples for culture recovery.
 28.01.2022, _ER Hyde, H Lozano, S Cox_


Sequencing-based protocols for studying the human microbiome have unearthed a wealth of information about the relationship between the microbiome and human health. But these microbes cannot be leveraged as therapeutic targets without culture-based studies to phenotype species of interest and to establish culture collections for use in animal models. Traditional sample collection protocols are focused on preserving nucleic acids and metabolites and are largely inappropriate for preserving sensitive anaerobic bacteria for later culture recovery. Here we introduce a novel microbiome preservation kit (BIOME-Preserve) that facilitates recovery of anaerobic bacteria from human stool. Using a combination of culture recovery and shallow whole-genome shotgun sequencing, we characterized the anaerobes cultured from fresh human stool and from human stool held at room temperature in BIOME-Preserve for up to 120 hours. We recovered several species of interest to microbiome researchers, including Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Blautia spp., Eubacterium halii (now Anaerobutyricum hallii), Akkermansia muciniphila, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. We also demonstrated that freezing at -80°C did not adversely affect our ability to culture organisms from BIOME-Preserve, suggesting that it is appropriate both as a transport medium and as a medium for longer-term ultra-cold storage. Together, our results suggest BIOME-Preserve is practical for the collection, transport, and culture of anaerobic bacteria from human samples and can help enable researchers to better understand the link between the microbiome and human health and how to leverage that link through novel microbiome-based therapeutics.

## Species-targeted sorting and cultivation of commensal bacteria from the gut microbiome using flow cytometry under anaerobic conditions.
 04.02.2022, _S Bellais, M Nehlich, M Ania, A Duquenoy, W Mazier, G van den Engh, J Baijer, NS Treichel, T Clavel, I Belotserkovsky, V Thomas_


There is a growing interest in using gut commensal bacteria as "next generation" probiotics. However, this approach is still hampered by the fact that there are few or no strains available for specific species that are difficult to cultivate. Our objective was to adapt flow cytometry and cell sorting to be able to detect, separate, isolate, and cultivate new strains of commensal species from fecal material. We focused on the extremely oxygen sensitive (EOS) species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the under-represented, health-associated keystone species Christensenella minuta as proof-of-concept.

## Panoramic Insights into Microevolution and Macroevolution of Prevotella copri-containing Lineage in Primate Guts.
 05.02.2022, _H Li, JP Meier-Kolthoff, C Hu, Z Wang, J Zhu, W Zheng, Y Tian, F Guo_


Prevotella copri and related taxa are widely detected in mammalian gut microbiomes and have been linked with an enterotype in humans. However, their microevolution and macroevolution among hosts are poorly characterized. In this study, extensively collected marker genes and genomes were analyzed to trace their evolutionary history, host specificity, and biogeographic distribution. Investigations based on marker genes and genomes suggest that a P. copri-containing lineage (PCL) harbors diverse species in higher primates. Firstly, P. copri in the human gut consists of multiple groups exhibiting high genomic divergence and conspicuous but non-strict biogeographic patterns. Most African strains with high genomic divergence from other strains were phylogenetically located at the root of the species, indicating the co-evolutionary history of P. copri and Homo sapiens. Secondly, although long-term co-evolution between PCL and higher primates was revealed, sporadic signals of co-speciation and extensive host jumping of PCL members were suggested among higher primates. Metagenomic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that P. copri and other PCL species found in domesticated mammals had been recently transmitted from humans. Thirdly, strong evidence was found on the extensively horizontal transfer of genes (e.g., genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes) among sympatric P. copri groups and PCL species in the same primate host. Our study provides panoramic insights into the combined effects of vertical and horizontal transmission, and potential niche adaption on speciation, host, and biogeographical distribution spanning microevolutionary and macroevolutionary history for an enterotype-representative lineage.

## The roles of recombination and selection in shaping genomic divergence in an incipient ecological species complex.
 04.02.2022, _MJ Wersebe, RE Sherman, PD Jeyasingh, LJ Weider_


Speciation genomic studies have revealed that genomes of diverging lineages are shaped jointly by the actions of gene flow and selection. These evolutionary forces acting in concert with processes such as recombination and genome features such as gene density shape a mosaic landscape of divergence. We investigated the roles of recombination and gene density in shaping the patterns of differentiation and divergence between the cyclically parthenogenetic ecological sister-taxa, Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia pulex. First, we assembled a phased chromosome-scale genome assembly using trio-binning for D. pulicaria and constructed a genetic map using an F2-intercross panel to understand sex-specific recombination rate heterogeneity. Finally, we used a ddRADseq dataset with broad geographic sampling of D. pulicaria, D. pulex, and their hybrids to understand the patterns of genome-scale divergence and demographic parameters. Our study provides the first sex-specific estimates of recombination rates for a cyclical parthenogen, and unlike other eukaryotic species, we observed male-biased heterochiasmy in D. pulicaria, which may be related to this somewhat unique breeding mode. Additionally, regions of high gene density and recombination are generally more divergent than regions of suppressed recombination. Outlier analysis indicated that divergent genomic regions are likely driven by selection on D. pulicaria, the derived lineage colonizing a novel lake habitat. Together, our study supports a scenario of selection acting on genes related to local adaptation shaping genome-wide patterns of differentiation despite high local recombination rates in this species complex. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our data in light of demographic uncertainty.
