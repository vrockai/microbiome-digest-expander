## Do seasonal microbiome changes affect infection susceptibility, contributing to seasonal disease outbreaks?
 09.11.2020, _A Stencel_


The aim of the present paper is to explore whether seasonal outbreaks of infectious diseases may be linked to changes in host microbiomes. This is a very important issue, because one way to have more control over seasonal outbreaks is to understand the factors that underlie them. In this paper, I will evaluate the relevance of the microbiome as one of such factors. The paper is based on two pillars of reasoning. Firstly, on the idea that microbiomes play an important role in their hosts' defence against infectious diseases. Secondly, on the idea that microbiomes are not stable, but change seasonally. These two ideas are combined in order to argue that seasonal changes in a given microbiome may influence the functionality of the host's immune system and consequently make it easier for infectious agents to infect the host at certain times of year. I will argue that, while this is only a theoretical possibility, certain studies may back up such claims. Furthermore, I will show that this does not necessarily contradict other hypotheses aimed at explaining seasonal outbreaks; in fact, it may even enhance them.

## Infant Skin Bacterial Communities Vary by Skin Site and Infant Age across Populations in Mexico and the United States.

Daily practices put humans in close contact with the surrounding environment, and differences in these practices have an impact on human physiology, development, and health. There is mounting evidence that the microbiome represents an interface that mediates interactions between the human body and the environment. In particular, the skin microbiome serves as the primary interface with the external environment and aids in host immune function by contributing as the first line of defense against pathogens. Despite these important connections, we have only a basic understanding of how the skin microbiome is first established, or which environmental factors contribute to its development. To this end, this study compared the skin bacterial communities of infants (n = 47) living in four populations in Mexico and the United States that span the socioeconomic gradient, where we predicted that variation in physical and social environments would shape the infant skin microbiome. Results of 16S rRNA bacterial gene sequencing on 119 samples (armpit, hand, and forehead) showed that infant skin bacterial diversity and composition are shaped by population-level factors, including those related to socioeconomic status and household composition, and vary by skin site and infant age. Differences in infant-environment interactions, including with other people, appear to vary across the populations, likely influencing infant microbial exposures and, in turn, the composition of infant skin bacterial communities. These findings suggest that variation in microbial exposures stemming from the local environment in infancy can impact the establishment of the skin microbiome across body sites, with implications for developmental and health outcomes.IMPORTANCE This study contributes to the sparse literature on the infant skin microbiome in general, and the virtually nonexistent literature on the infant skin microbiome in a field setting. While microbiome research often addresses patterns at a national scale, this study addresses the influence of population-level factors, such as maternal socioeconomic status and contact with caregivers, on infant skin bacterial communities. This approach strengthens our understanding of how local variables influence the infant skin microbiome, and paves the way for additional studies to combine biological sample collection with questionnaires to adequately capture how specific behaviors dictate infant microbial exposures. Work in this realm has implications for infant care and health, as well as for investigating how the microbial communities of different body sites develop over time, with applications to specific health outcomes associated with the skin microbiome (e.g., immune system development or atopic dermatitis).

## Identification of Vaginal Microbial Communities Associated with Extreme Cervical Shortening in Pregnant Women.

The vaginal microbiota plays a critical role in pregnancy. Bacteria from Lactobacillus spp. are thought to maintain immune homeostasis and modulate the inflammatory responses against pathogens implicated in cervical shortening, one of the risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth. We studied vaginal microbiota in 46 pregnant women of predominantly Caucasian ethnicity diagnosed with short cervix (&lt;25 mm), and identified microbial communities associated with extreme cervical shortening (≤10 mm). Vaginal microbiota was defined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and clustered into community state types (CSTs), based on dominance or depletion of Lactobacillus spp. No correlation between CSTs distribution and maternal age or gestational age was revealed. CST-IV, dominated by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria different than Lactobacilli, was associated with extreme cervical shortening (odds ratio (OR) = 15.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.56-14.21; p = 0.019). CST-III (L. iners-dominated) was also associated with extreme cervical shortening (OR = 6.4, 95% CI = 1.32-31.03; p = 0.02). Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was diagnosed in 10/46 women. Bacterial richness was significantly higher in women experiencing this metabolic disorder, but no association with cervical shortening was revealed by statistical analysis. Our study confirms that Lactobacillus-depleted microbiota is significantly associated with an extremely short cervix in women of predominantly Caucasian ethnicity, and also suggests an association between L. iners-dominated microbiota (CST III) and cervical shortening.
