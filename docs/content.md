Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces CRC incidence and mortality. However, current screening methods are either hampered by invasiveness or suboptimal performance, limiting their effectiveness as primary screening methods. To aid in the development of a non-invasive screening test with improved sensitivity and specificity, we have initiated a prospective biomarker study (CRCbiome), nested within a large randomized CRC screening trial in Norway. We aim to develop a microbiome-based classification algorithm to identify advanced colorectal lesions in screening participants testing positive for an immunochemical fecal occult blood test (FIT). We will also examine interactions with host factors, diet, lifestyle and prescription drugs. The prospective nature of the study also enables the analysis of changes in the gut microbiome following the removal of precancerous lesions.

## The intratumoral microbiome: Characterization methods and functional impact.

Live-pathogenic bacteria, which were identified inside tumors hundreds year ago, are key elements in modern cancer research. As they have a relatively accessible genome, they offer a multitude of metabolic engineering opportunities, useful in several clinical fields. Better understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its associated microbiome would help conceptualize new metabolically engineered species, triggering efficient therapeutic responses against cancer. Unfortunately, given the low microbial biomass nature of tumors, characterizing the tumor microbiome remains a challenge. Tumors have a high host versus bacterial DNA ratio, making it extremely complex to identify tumor-associated bacteria. Nevertheless, with the improvements in next-generation analytic tools, recent studies demonstrated the existence of intratumor bacteria inside defined tumors. It is now proven that each cancer subtype has a unique microbiome, characterized by bacterial communities with specific metabolic functions. This review provides a brief overview of the main approaches used to characterize the tumor microbiome, and of the recently proposed functions of intracellular bacteria identified in oncological entities. The therapeutic aspects of live-pathogenic microbes are also discussed, regarding the tumor microenvironment of each cancer type.
