There are increasing data about the role of the gut microbiome in various autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated disease. Current treatment strategies in psoriasis include immunomodulating biologic agents. A variable response to this type of therapy has been reported in psoriatic patients. A possible effect of biologic therapy on the gut microbiome composition has been suggested, but data are still limited. The aim of this study was to compare the gut microbiome composition between psoriatic patients treated and untreated with biologic drugs in order to identify differences which may highlight the potential impact of the treatment on the gut microbiome. 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were performed on the fecal samples of 30 psoriatic patients with similar clinicopathological features, 10 of whom were undergoing biologic therapy and 20 not receiving systemic therapy. Alpha and beta diversity significantly differed between the two groups of patients. A reduced bacterial biodiversity in the group of treated patients compared with the group of untreated patients was observed. Differential relative abundances of key gut microbial communities, including Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides plebeius, were identified between the two groups of patients. This study showed that biologic therapy may have an impact on the composition of the gut microbiome of psoriatic patients. Gut microbiome composition could be used as an indicator of response to therapy and the modulation of the microbial composition could help to restore the intestinal symbiosis in psoriatic patients.

## A Novel Carboxylesterase Derived from a Compost Metagenome Exhibiting High Stability and Activity towards High Salinity.
 27.01.2021, _M Lu, R Daniel_


Halotolerant lipolytic enzymes have gained growing interest, due to potential applications under harsh conditions, such as hypersalinity and presence of organic solvents. In this study, a lipolytic gene, est56, encoding 287 amino acids was identified by functional screening of a compost metagenome. Subsequently, the gene was heterologously expressed, and the recombinant protein (Est56) was purified and characterized. Est56 is a mesophilic (Topt 50 °C) and moderate alkaliphilic (pHopt 8) enzyme, showing high thermostability at 30 and 40 °C. Strikingly, Est56 is halotolerant as it exhibited high activity and stability in the presence of up to 4 M NaCl or KCl. Est56 also displayed enhanced stability against high temperatures (50 and 60 °C) and urea (2, 4, and 6 M) in the presence of NaCl. In addition, the recently reported halotolerant lipolytic enzymes were summarized. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these enzymes into 13 lipolytic protein families. The majority (45%) including Est56 belonged to family IV. To explore the haloadaptation of halotolerant enzymes, the amino acid composition between halotolerant and halophilic enzymes was statistically compared. The most distinctive feature of halophilic from non-halophilic enzymes are the higher content of acidic residues (Asp and Glu), and a lower content of lysine, aliphatic hydrophobic (Leu, Met and Ile) and polar (Asn) residues. The amino acid composition and 3-D structure analysis suggested that the high content of acidic residues (Asp and Glu, 12.2%) and low content of lysine residues (0.7%), as well as the excess of surface-exposed acidic residues might be responsible for the haloadaptation of Est56.
