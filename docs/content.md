## A data-driven approach for predicting the impact of drugs on the human microbiome.
 18.06.2023, _YM Algavi, E Borenstein_


Many medications can negatively impact the bacteria residing in our gut, depleting beneficial species, and causing adverse effects. To guide personalized pharmaceutical treatment, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of various drugs on the gut microbiome is needed, yet, to date, experimentally challenging to obtain. Towards this end, we develop a data-driven approach, integrating information about the chemical properties of each drug and the genomic content of each microbe, to systematically predict drug-microbiome interactions. We show that this framework successfully predicts outcomes of in-vitro pairwise drug-microbe experiments, as well as drug-induced microbiome dysbiosis in both animal models and clinical trials. Applying this methodology, we systematically map a large array of interactions between pharmaceuticals and human gut bacteria and demonstrate that medications' anti-microbial properties are tightly linked to their adverse effects. This computational framework has the potential to unlock the development of personalized medicine and microbiome-based therapeutic approaches, improving outcomes and minimizing side effects.

Disruption of the microbial community in the respiratory tract due to infections, like influenza, could impact transmission of bacterial pathogens. Using samples from a household study, we determined whether metagenomic-type analyses of the microbiome provide the resolution necessary to track transmission of airway bacteria. Microbiome studies have shown that the microbial community across various body sites tends to be more similar between individuals who cohabit in the same household than between individuals from different households. We tested whether there was increased sharing of bacteria from the airways within households with influenza infections as compared to control households with no influenza.

Although increasing evidence links microbial dysbiosis with the risk for psychiatric symptoms through the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA), the specific mechanisms remain poorly characterized. In a diagnostically heterogeneous group of treated psychiatric cases and nonpsychiatric controls, we characterized the gut and oral microbiome, plasma cytokines, and hippocampal inflammatory processes via proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI). Using a transdiagnostic approach, these data were examined in association with schizophrenia-related symptoms measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Psychiatric cases had significantly greater heterogeneity of gut alpha diversity and an enrichment of pathogenic taxa, like Veillonella and Prevotella, in the oral microbiome, which was an accurate classifier of phenotype. Cases exhibited significantly greater positive, negative, and general PANSS scores that uniquely correlated with bacterial taxa. Strong, positive correlations of bacterial taxa were also found with cytokines and hippocampal gliosis, dysmyelination, and excitatory neurotransmission. This pilot study supports the hypothesis that the MGBA influences psychiatric symptomatology in a transdiagnostic manner. The relative importance of the oral microbiome in peripheral and hippocampal inflammatory pathways was highlighted, suggesting opportunities for probiotics and oral health to diagnose and treat psychiatric conditions.

## Effects of vaginal microbiota transfer on the neurodevelopment and microbiome of cesarean-born infants: A blinded randomized controlled trial.
 16.06.2023, _L Zhou, W Qiu, J Wang, A Zhao, C Zhou, T Sun, Z Xiong, P Cao, W Shen, J Chen, X Lai, LH Zhao, Y Wu, M Li, F Qiu, Y Yu, ZZ Xu, H Zhou, W Jia, Y Liao, R Retnakaran, D Krewski, SW Wen, JC Clemente, T Chen, RH Xie, Y He_


The microbiomes of cesarean-born infants differ from vaginally delivered infants and are associated with increased disease risks. Vaginal microbiota transfer (VMT) to newborns may reverse C-section-related microbiome disturbances. Here, we evaluated the effect of VMT by exposing newborns to maternal vaginal fluids and assessing neurodevelopment, as well as the fecal microbiota and metabolome. Sixty-eight cesarean-delivered infants were randomly assigned a VMT or saline gauze intervention immediately after delivery in a triple-blind manner (ChiCTR2000031326). Adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups. Infant neurodevelopment, as measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3) score at 6 months, was significantly higher with VMT than saline. VMT significantly accelerated gut microbiota maturation and regulated levels of certain fecal metabolites and metabolic functions, including carbohydrate, energy, and amino acid metabolisms, within 42 days after birth. Overall, VMT is likely safe and may partially normalize neurodevelopment and the fecal microbiome in cesarean-delivered infants.

## Metaproteomics Characterizes the Human Gingival Crevicular Fluid Microbiome Function in Periodontitis.
 16.06.2023, _X Xiao, X Xiao, Y Liu, H Sun, X Liu, Z Guo, Q Li, W Sun_


Periodontitis is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults worldwide. The human proteome and metaproteome characterization of periodontitis is not clearly understood. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from eight periodontitis and eight healthy subjects. Both the human and microbial proteins were characterized by liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. A total of 570 human proteins were found differentially expressed, which were primarily associated with inflammatory response, cell death, cellular junction, and fatty acid metabolism. For the metaproteome, 51 genera were identified, and 10 genera were found highly expressed in periodontitis, while 11 genera were downregulated. The analysis showed that microbial proteins related to butyrate metabolism were upregulated in periodontitis cases. In particular, correlation analysis showed that the expression of host proteins related to inflammatory response, cell death, cellular junction, and lipid metabolism correlates with the alteration of metaproteins, which reflect the changes of molecular function during the occurrence of periodontitis. This study showed that the gingival crevicular fluid human proteome and metaproteome could reflect the characteristics of periodontitis. This might benefit the understanding of the periodontitis mechanism.

## Generation of dysbiotic microbiota in cutaneous leishmaniasis and enhancement of skin inflammation.
 18.06.2023, _S Naz, Z Ali, A Minhas, A Fatima, S Waseem_


Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) affects millions of people globally and has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Innate immune mediators are likely to influence the clinical phenotype of CL through primary responses that restrict or facilitate parasite spread. The aim of this preliminary study was to bring to attention the significance of microbiota in the development of CL and emphasized the necessity of including the role of microbiota in CL while promoting a One Health approach for managing diseases. To achieve this, we used 16S amplicon metagenome sequencing and QIIME2 pipeline to analyze the microbiome composition of CL-infected patients compared to non-infected, healthy subjects. 16S sequencing analysis showed serum microbiome was dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Actinobacteria. CL-infected individuals, Proteobacteria were the most prevalent (27.63 ± 9.79), with the relative abundance (10.73 ± 5.33) of Proteobacteria in control. Bacilli class was found to be the most prevalent in healthy controls (30.71 ± 8.44) while (20.57 ± 9.51) in CL-infected individuals. The class Alphaproteobacteria was found to be more in CL-infected individuals (5.47 ± 2.07) as compared to healthy controls (1.85 ± 0.39). The CL-infected individuals had a significantly lower relative abundance of the Clostridia class (p &lt; 0.0001). An altered serum microbiome of CL infection and higher microbial abundance in the serum of healthy individuals was observed.

## Oral microbiota may affect osteoradionecrosis following radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.
 18.06.2023, _Z Li, R Fu, X Huang, X Wen, L Zhang_


Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a serious complication of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC). However, its etiology and pathogenesis have not been completely elucidated. Recent studies suggest the involvement of the oral microbiota in the development of ORN. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between oral microbiota and the extent of bone resorption in ORN patients.

## Analysis of gut microbiota in patients with Williams-Beuren Syndrome reveals dysbiosis linked to clinical manifestations.
 18.06.2023, _F Del Chierico, V Marzano, M Scanu, S Reddel, ML Dentici, R Capolino, M Di Donato, I Spasari, EV Fiscarelli, MC Digilio, MT Abreu, B Dallapiccola, L Putignani_


Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a multisystem genetic disease caused by the deletion of a region of 1.5-1.8 Mb on chromosome 7q11.23. The elastin gene seems to account for several comorbidities and distinct clinical features such including cardiovascular disease, connective tissue abnormalities, growth retardation, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Increasing evidence points to alterations in gut microbiota composition as a primary or secondary cause of some GI or extra-intestinal characteristics. In this study, we performed the first exploratory analysis of gut microbiota in WBS patients compared to healthy subjects (CTRLs) using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, by investigating the gut dysbiosis in relation to diseases and comorbidities. We found that patients with WBS have significant dysbiosis compared to age-matched CTRLs, characterized by an increase in proinflammatory bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Gluconacetobacter and Eggerthella, and a reduction of anti-inflammatory bacteria including Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium. Microbial biomarkers associated with weight gain, GI symptoms and hypertension were identified. Gut microbiota profiling could represent a new tool that characterise intestinal dysbiosis to complement the clinical management of these patients. In particular, the administration of microbial-based treatments, alongside traditional therapies, could help in reducing or preventing the burden of these symptoms and improve the quality of life of these patients.

## Aspects of oral streptococcal metabolic diversity: Imagining the landscape beneath the fog.
 17.06.2023, _P Zuber, J Kreth_


It is widely acknowledged that the human-associated microbial community influences host physiology, systemic health, disease progression, and even behavior. There is currently an increased interest in the oral microbiome, which occupies the entryway to much of what the human initially encounters from the environment. In addition to the dental pathology that results from a dysbiotic microbiome, microbial activity within the oral cavity exerts significant systemic effects. The composition and activity of the oral microbiome is influenced by (1) host-microbial interactions, (2) the emergence of niche-specific microbial "ecotypes," and (3) numerous microbe-microbe interactions, shaping the underlying microbial metabolic landscape. The oral streptococci are central players in the microbial activity ongoing in the oral cavity, due to their abundance and prevalence in the oral environment and the many interspecies interactions in which they participate. Streptococci are major determinants of a healthy homeostatic oral environment. The metabolic activities of oral Streptococci, particularly the metabolism involved in energy generation and regeneration of oxidative resources vary among the species and are important factors in niche-specific adaptations and intra-microbiome interactions. Here we summarize key differences among streptococcal central metabolic networks and species-specific differences in how the key glycolytic intermediates are utilized.

## Challenges and strategies for preventing intestinal damage associated to mercury dietary exposure.
 17.06.2023, _P Rodríguez-Viso, A Domene, A Sánchez, D Vélez, V Monedero, V Devesa, M Zúñiga_


Food represents the major risk factor for exposure to mercury in most human populations. Therefore, passage through the gastrointestinal tract plays a fundamental role in its entry into the organism. Despite the intense research carried out on the toxicity of Hg, the effects at the intestinal level have received increased attention only recently. In this review we first provide a critical appraisal of the recent advances on the toxic effects of Hg at the intestinal epithelium. Next, dietary strategies aimed to diminish Hg bioavailability or modulate the epithelial and microbiota responses will be revised. Food components and additives, including probiotics, will be considered. Finally, limitations of current approaches to tackle this problem and future lines of research will be discussed.

## Phylogenetic comparative approach reveals evolutionary conservatism, ancestral composition, and integration of vertebrate gut microbiota.
 16.06.2023, _B Perez-Lamarque, G Sommeria-Klein, L Duret, H Morlon_


How host-associated microbial communities evolve as their hosts diversify remains equivocal: How conserved is their composition? What was the composition of ancestral microbiota? Do microbial taxa covary in abundance over millions of years? Multivariate phylogenetic models of trait evolution are key to answering similar questions for complex host phenotypes, yet they are not directly applicable to relative abundances, which usually characterize microbiota. Here, we extend these models in this context, thereby providing a powerful approach for estimating phylosymbiosis (the extent to which closely related host species harbor similar microbiota), ancestral microbiota composition, and integration (evolutionary covariations in bacterial abundances). We apply our model to the gut microbiota of mammals and birds. We find significant phylosymbiosis that is not entirely explained by diet and geographic location, indicating that other evolutionary-conserved traits shape microbiota composition. We identify main shifts in microbiota composition during the evolution of the two groups and infer an ancestral mammalian microbiota consistent with an insectivorous diet. We also find remarkably consistent evolutionary covariations among bacterial orders in mammals and birds. Surprisingly, despite the substantial variability of present-day gut microbiota, some aspects of their composition are conserved over millions of years of host evolutionary history.

## Social transmission of bacterial symbionts homogenizes the microbiome within and across generations of group-living spiders.
 18.06.2023, _C Rose, MB Lund, AM Søgård, MM Busck, JS Bechsgaard, A Schramm, T Bilde_


Disentangling modes and fidelity of symbiont transmission are key for understanding host-symbiont associations in wild populations. In group-living animals, social transmission may evolve to ensure high-fidelity transmission of symbionts, since non-reproducing helpers constitute a dead-end for vertical transmission. We investigated symbiont transmission in the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola, which lives in family groups where the majority of females are non-reproducing helpers, females feed offspring by regurgitation, and individuals feed communally on insect prey. Group members share temporally stable microbiomes across generations, while distinct variation in microbiome composition exists between groups. We hypothesized that horizontal transmission of symbionts is enhanced by social interactions, and investigated transmission routes within (horizontal) and across (vertical) generations using bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in three experiments: (i) individuals were sampled at all life stages to assess at which life stage the microbiome is acquired. (ii) a cross-fostering design was employed to test whether offspring carry the microbiome from their natal nest, or acquire the microbiome of the foster nest via social transmission. (iii) adult spiders with different microbiome compositions were mixed to assess whether social transmission homogenizes microbiome composition among group members. We demonstrate that offspring hatch symbiont-free, and bacterial symbionts are transmitted vertically across generations by social interactions with the onset of regurgitation feeding by (foster)mothers in an early life stage. Social transmission governs horizontal inter-individual mixing and homogenization of microbiome composition among nest mates. We conclude that temporally stable host-symbiont associations in social species can be facilitated and maintained by high-fidelity social transmission.

## Rookery through rehabilitation: Microbial community assembly in newborn harbour seals after maternal separation.
 17.06.2023, _AD Switzer, BJ Callahan, EK Costello, EM Bik, C Fontaine, FMD Gulland, DA Relman_


Microbial community assembly remains largely unexplored in marine mammals, despite its potential importance for conservation and management. Here, neonatal microbiota assembly was studied in harbour seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) at a rehabilitation facility soon after maternal separation, through weaning, to the time of release back to their native environment. We found that the gingival and rectal communities of rehabilitated harbour seals were distinct from the microbiotas of formula and pool water, and became increasingly diverse and dissimilar over time, ultimately resembling the gingival and rectal communities of local wild harbour seals. Harbour seal microbiota assembly was compared to that of human infants, revealing the rapid emergence of host specificity and evidence of phylosymbiosis even though these harbour seals had been raised by humans. Early life prophylactic antibiotics were associated with changes in the composition of the harbour seal gingival and rectal communities and surprisingly, with transient increases in alpha diversity, perhaps because of microbiota sharing during close cohabitation with other harbour seals. Antibiotic-associated effects dissipated over time. These results suggest that while early life maternal contact may provide seeding for microbial assembly, co-housing of conspecifics during rehabilitation may help neonatal mammals achieve a healthy host-specific microbiota with features of resilience.

## The TaxUMAP atlas: Efficient display of large clinical microbiome data reveals ecological competition in protection against bacteremia.

Longitudinal microbiome data provide valuable insight into disease states and clinical responses, but they are challenging to mine and view collectively. To address these limitations, we present TaxUMAP, a taxonomically informed visualization for displaying microbiome states in large clinical microbiome datasets. We used TaxUMAP to chart a microbiome atlas of 1,870 patients with cancer during therapy-induced perturbations. Bacterial density and diversity were positively associated, but the trend was reversed in liquid stool. Low-diversity states (dominations) remained stable after antibiotic treatment, and diverse communities had a broader range of antimicrobial resistance genes than dominations. When examining microbiome states associated with risk for bacteremia, TaxUMAP revealed that certain Klebsiella species were associated with lower risk for bacteremia localize in a region of the atlas that is depleted in high-risk enterobacteria. This indicated a competitive interaction that was validated experimentally. Thus, TaxUMAP can chart comprehensive longitudinal microbiome datasets, enabling insights into microbiome effects on human health.

## MetaNovo: An open-source pipeline for probabilistic peptide discovery in complex metaproteomic datasets.
 16.06.2023, _MG Potgieter, AJM Nel, S Fortuin, S Garnett, JM Wendoh, DL Tabb, NJ Mulder, JM Blackburn_


Microbiome research is providing important new insights into the metabolic interactions of complex microbial ecosystems involved in fields as diverse as the pathogenesis of human diseases, agriculture and climate change. Poor correlations typically observed between RNA and protein expression datasets make it hard to accurately infer microbial protein synthesis from metagenomic data. Additionally, mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic analyses typically rely on focused search sequence databases based on prior knowledge for protein identification that may not represent all the proteins present in a set of samples. Metagenomic 16S rRNA sequencing only targets the bacterial component, while whole genome sequencing is at best an indirect measure of expressed proteomes. Here we describe a novel approach, MetaNovo, that combines existing open-source software tools to perform scalable de novo sequence tag matching with a novel algorithm for probabilistic optimization of the entire UniProt knowledgebase to create tailored sequence databases for target-decoy searches directly at the proteome level, enabling metaproteomic analyses without prior expectation of sample composition or metagenomic data generation and compatible with standard downstream analysis pipelines.

## Methods for Analyzing the Gut Microbiota in Diabetic Retinopathy.
 18.06.2023, _Y Huang, JH Ma, Y Peng, X Yang, J Chen, S Tang_


The gut microbiome that inhabits human hosts plays an important role in the development of a healthy host immune system. Many studies have shown that gut microbiota is involved in the occurrence and development of diabetic retinopathy (DR). With the advent of sequencing technology of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, microbiota studies are becoming more feasible. Here, we described a study protocol to characterize the microbiota composite in the DR and non-DR patients compared with healthy controls.

## Using nanopore sequencing to identify fungi from clinical samples with high phylogenetic resolution.
 18.06.2023, _A Ohta, K Nishi, K Hirota, Y Matsuo_


The study of microbiota has been revolutionized by the development of DNA metabarcoding. This sequence-based approach enables the direct detection of microorganisms without the need for culture and isolation, which significantly reduces analysis time and offers more comprehensive taxonomic profiles across broad phylogenetic lineages. While there has been an accumulating number of researches on bacteria, molecular phylogenetic analysis of fungi still remains challenging due to the lack of standardized tools and the incompleteness of reference databases limiting the accurate and precise identification of fungal taxa. Here, we present a DNA metabarcoding workflow for characterizing fungal microbiota with high taxonomic resolution. This method involves amplifying longer stretches of ribosomal RNA operons and sequencing them using nanopore long-read sequencing technology. The resulting reads were error-polished to generate consensus sequences with 99.5-100% accuracy, which were then aligned against reference genome assemblies. The efficacy of this method was explored using a polymicrobial mock community and patient-derived specimens, demonstrating the marked potential of long-read sequencing combined with consensus calling for accurate taxonomic classification. Our approach offers a powerful tool for the rapid identification of pathogenic fungi and has the promise to significantly improve our understanding of the role of fungi in health and disease.
