Pathogenic viral infections represent a major challenge to human health. Host immune responses to respiratory viruses are closely associated with microbiome and metabolism via the gut-lung axis. It has been known that host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) involves activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, however, mechanisms behind the protective function of NLRP3 are not fully known. Here we show that an isolated bacterial strain, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum NjM1, enriched in the gut microbiota of Nlrp3-/- mice, protects wild-type but not Nlrp3 deficient mice against IAV infection. This effect depends on the enhanced production of type I interferon (IFN-I) mediated by NjM1-derived acetate. Application of exogenous acetate reproduces the protective effect of NjM1. Mechanistically, NLRP3 bridges GPR43 and MAVS, and promotes the oligomerization and signalling of MAVS; while acetate enhances MAVS aggregation upon GPR43 engagement, leading to elevated IFN-I production. Thus, our data support a model of NLRP3 mediating enhanced induction of IFN-I via acetate-producing bacterium and suggest that the acetate-GPR43-NLRP3-MAVS-IFN-I signalling axis is a potential therapeutic target against respiratory viral infections.

## Gut microbiota remodeling improves natural aging-related disorders through Akkermansia muciniphila and its derived acetic acid.

Accumulating evidence indicates gut microbiota contributes to aging-related disorders. However, the exact mechanism underlying gut dysbiosis-related pathophysiological changes during aging remains largely unclear. In the current study, we first performed gut microbiota remodeling on old mice by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from young mice, and then characterized the bacteria signature that was specifically altered by FMT. Our results revealed that FMT significantly improved natural aging-related systemic disorders, particularly exerted hepatoprotective effects, and improved glucose sensitivity, hepatosplenomegaly, inflammaging, antioxidative capacity and intestinal barrier. Moreover, FMT particularly increased the abundance of fecal A.muciniphila, which was almost nondetectable in old mice. Interestingly, A.muciniphila supplementation also exerted similar benefits with FMT on old mice. Notably, targeted metabolomics on short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) revealed that only acetic acid was consistently reversed by FMT. Then, acetic acid intervention exerted beneficial actions on both Caenorhabditis elegans and natural aging mice. In conclusion, our current study demonstrated that gut microbiota remodeling improved natural aging-related disorders through A.muciniphila and its derived acetic acid, suggesting that interventions with potent stimulative capacity on A. muciniphila growth and production of acetic acid was alternative and effective way to maintain healthy aging. DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT: The data of RNAseq and 16S rRNA gene sequencing can be accessed in NCBI with the accession number PRJNA848996 and PRJNA849355.

Sleep loss is a serious global health concern. Consequences include memory deficits and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Our previous research showed that melatonin can effectively improve cognitive impairment and intestinal microbiota disturbances caused by sleep deprivation (SD). The present study further explored the mechanism by which exogenous melatonin prevents SD-induced cognitive impairments. Here, we established fecal microbiota transplantation, Aeromonas colonization and LPS or butyrate supplementation tests to evaluate the role of the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites in melatonin in alleviating SD-induced memory impairment. RESULTS: Transplantation of the SD-gut microbiota into normal mice induced microglia overactivation and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus, cognitive decline, and colonic microbiota disorder, manifesting as increased levels of Aeromonas and LPS and decreased levels of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 and butyrate. All these events were reversed with the transplantation of SD + melatonin-gut microbiota. Colonization with Aeromonas and the addition of LPS produced an inflammatory response in the hippocampus and spatial memory impairment in mice. These changes were reversed by supplementation with melatonin, accompanied by decreased levels of Aeromonas and LPS. Butyrate administration to sleep-deprived mice restored inflammatory responses and memory impairment. In vitro, LPS supplementation caused an inflammatory response in BV2 cells, which was improved by butyrate supplementation. This ameliorative effect of butyrate was blocked by pretreatment with MCT1 inhibitor and HDAC3 agonist but was mimicked by TLR4 and p-P65 antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbes and their metabolites mediate the ameliorative effects of melatonin on SD-induced cognitive impairment. A feasible mechanism is that melatonin downregulates the levels of Aeromonas and constituent LPS and upregulates the levels of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 and butyrate in the colon. These changes lessen the inflammatory response and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus through crosstalk between the TLR4/NF-κB and MCT1/ HDAC3 signaling pathways. Video Abstract.

## Strain Tracking with Uncertainty Quantification.

The ability to detect and quantify microbiota over time has a plethora of clinical, basic science, and public health applications. One of the primary means of tracking microbiota is through sequencing technologies. When the microorganism of interest is well characterized or known a priori , targeted sequencing is often used. In many applications, however, untargeted bulk (shotgun) sequencing is more appropriate; for instance, the tracking of infection transmission events and nucleotide variants across multiple genomic loci, or studying the role of multiple genes in a particular phenotype. Given these applications, and the observation that pathogens (e.g. Clostridioides difficile, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica ) and other taxa of interest can reside at low relative abundance in the gastrointestinal tract, there is a critical need for algorithms that accurately track low-abundance taxa with strain level resolution. Here we present a sequence quality- and time-aware model, ChronoStrain , that introduces uncertainty quantification to gauge low-abundance species and significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art on both real and synthetic data. ChronoStrain leverages sequences' quality scores and the samples' temporal information to produce a probability distribution over abundance trajectories for each strain tracked in the model. We demonstrate Chronostrain's improved performance in capturing post-antibiotic E. coli strain blooms among women with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) from the UTI Microbiome (UMB) Project. Other strain tracking models on the same data either show inconsistent temporal colonization or can only track consistently using very coarse groupings. In contrast, our probabilistic outputs can reveal the relationship between low-confidence strains present in the sample that cannot be reliably assigned a single reference label (either due to poor coverage or novelty) while simultaneously calling high-confidence strains that can be unambiguously assigned a label. We also include and analyze newly sequenced cultured samples from the UMB Project.

## Efficient computation of contributional diversity metrics from microbiome data with FuncDiv.
 11.01.2023, _GM Douglas, S Kim, MGI Langille, BJ Shapiro_


_Microbiota, Metagenomics, Software_
Microbiome datasets with taxa linked to the functions (e.g. genes) they encode are becoming more common as metagenomics sequencing approaches improve. However, these data are challenging to analyze due to their complexity. Summary metrics, such as the alpha and beta diversity of taxa contributing to each function (i.e. contributional diversity), represent one approach to investigate these data, but currently there are no straightforward methods for doing so.
