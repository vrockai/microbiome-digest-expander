The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem containing bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeasts and other single-celled organisms. It is involved in the development and maintenance of both innate and systemic immunity of the body. Emerging evidence has shown its role in liver diseases through the immune system cross-talk. We review herein literature data regarding the triangular interaction between gut microbiota, immune system and liver in health and disease.

## Physicochemical Parameters Affecting the Distribution and Diversity of the Water Column Microbial Community in the High-Altitude Andean Lake System of La Brava and La Punta.
 06.08.2020, _R Núñez Salazar, C Aguirre, J Soto, P Salinas, C Salinas, H Prieto, M Paneque_


Due to the low incidence of precipitation attributed to climate change, many high-altitude Andean lakes (HAALs) and lagoons distributed along the central Andes in South America may soon disappear. This includes La Brava-La Punta, a brackish lake system located south of the Salar de Atacama within a hyper-arid and halophytic biome in the Atacama Desert. Variations in the physicochemical parameters of the water column can induce changes in microbial community composition, which we aimed to determine. Sixteen sampling points across La Brava-La Punta were studied to assess the influence of water physicochemical properties on the aquatic microbial community, determined via 16S rRNA gene analysis. Parameters such as pH and the concentrations of silica, magnesium, calcium, salinity, and dissolved oxygen showed a more homogenous pattern in La Punta samples, whereas those from La Brava had greater variability; pH and total silica were significantly different between La Brava and La Punta. The predominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. The genera Psychroflexus (36.85%), Thiomicrospira (12.48%), and Pseudomonas (7.81%) were more abundant in La Brava, while Pseudospirillum (20.73%) and Roseovarius (17.20%) were more abundant in La Punta. Among the parameters, pH was the only statistically significant factor influencing the diversity within La Brava lake. These results complement the known microbial diversity and composition in the HAALs of the Atacama Desert.

## Metagenomic insights into the effects of nanobubble water on the composition of gut microbiota in mice.
 06.08.2020, _Z Guo, B Hu, H Han, Z Lei, K Shimizu, L Zhang, Z Zhang_


The particular physicochemical and biological properties of nanobubbles (NBs) have prompted many researchers to conduct an in-depth study on their potential application in various fields. This study aims to investigate the effects of nanobubble water (NBW) on the community structure of the gut microbiota in mice. In this study, supplementation with nitrogen NBW (SD-N2 group), hydrogen NBW (SD-H2 group) and deionized water (SD-C group) to a standard diet of mice was performed for five weeks. The composition of fecal microbiota was analyzed by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Compared with the SD-C group, the species diversity of the fecal microbiota in mice in NBW groups was significantly increased. At the genus level, supplementation with nitrogen NBW to mice significantly increased the relative abundance of two beneficial genera Clostridium and Coprococcus (mean growth 6.3 times and 9.7 times, respectively), while supplementation with hydrogen NBW significantly decreased the relative abundance of two pathogenic genera Mucispirillum and Helicobacter (mean reduction rate 86% and 60%, respectively). These results demonstrate that supplementation with NBW might optimize the composition of gut microbiota in mice.

## Dietary Components, Microbial Metabolites and Human Health: Reading between the Lines.
 06.08.2020, _Y Guo, X Bian, J Liu, M Zhu, L Li, T Yao, C Tang, V Ravichandran, P Liao, K Papadimitriou, J Yin_


Trillions of bacteria reside in the human gut and they metabolize dietary substances to obtain nutrients and energy while producing metabolites. Therefore, different dietary components could affect human health in various ways through microbial metabolism. Many such metabolites have been shown to affect human physiological activities, including short-chain fatty acids metabolized from carbohydrates; indole, kynurenic acid and para-cresol, metabolized from amino acids; conjugated linoleic acid and linoleic acid, metabolized from lipids. Here, we review the features of these metabolites and summarize the possible molecular mechanisms of their metabolisms by gut microbiota. We discuss the potential roles of these metabolites in health and diseases, and the interactions between host metabolism and the gut microbiota. We also show some of the major dietary patterns around the world and hope this review can provide insights into our eating habits and improve consumers' health conditions.

## Microbiota on Biotics: Probiotics, Prebiotics, and Synbiotics to Optimize Growth and Metabolism.
 06.08.2020, _PT Edwards, PC Kashyap, GA Preidis_


The early stages of the metagenomics era produced countless observational studies linking various human diseases to alterations in the gut microbiota. Only recently have we begun to decipher the causal roles that gut microbes play in many of these conditions. Despite an incomplete understanding of how gut microbes influence pathophysiology, clinical trials have tested empirically numerous microbiota-targeting therapies to prevent or treat disease. Unsurprisingly, these trials have yielded mixed results. Nonetheless, the consumer market for probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics continues to grow. This mini-review highlights recent discoveries of mechanisms underlying diet-microbial-host interactions as they pertain to growth and metabolism and discusses current and future applications of microbiota-targeting therapies in the context of child malnutrition as well as obesity and its metabolic comorbidities including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease. We also highlight current challenges and identify future directions to facilitate a more efficient and direct path to clinical impact.

## The Effectiveness of Multi-Session FMT Treatment in Active Ulcerative Colitis Patients: A Pilot Study.
 06.08.2020, _D Mańkowska-Wierzbicka, M Stelmach-Mardas, M Gabryel, H Tomczak, M Skrzypczak-Zielińska, O Zakerska-Banaszak, A Sowińska, D Mahadea, A Baturo, Ł Wolko, R Słomski, A Dobrowolska_


The modification of the microbiome through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is becoming a very promising therapeutic option for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Our pilot study aimed to assess the effectiveness of multi-session FMT treatment in active ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Ten patients with UC were treated with multi-session FMT (200 mL) from healthy donors, via colonoscopy/gastroscopy. Patients were evaluated as follows: at baseline, at week 7, and after 6 months, routine blood tests (including C reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin) were performed. 16S rRNA gene (V3V4) sequencing was used for metagenomic analysis. The severity of UC was classified based on the Truelove-Witts index. The assessment of microbial diversity showed significant differences between recipients and healthy donors. FMT contributed to long-term, significant clinical and biochemical improvement. Metagenomic analysis revealed an increase in the amount of Lactobacillaceaea, Micrococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, and TM7 phylumsp.oral clone EW055 during FMT, whereas Staphylococcaceae and Bacillaceae declined significantly. A positive increase in the proportion of the genera Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Veillonella and a decrease in Bacillus, Bacteroides, and Staphylococcus were observed based on the correlation between calprotectin and Bacillus and Staphylococcus; ferritin and Lactobacillus, Veillonella, and Bifidobacterium abundance was indicated. A positive change in the abundance of Firmicutes was observed during FMT and after 6 months. The application of multi-session FMT led to the restoration of recipients' microbiota and resulted in the remission of patients with active UC.

## Neurological and cognitive significance of probiotics: a holy grail deciding individual personality.
 06.08.2020, _M Afzal, SF Mazhar, S Sana, M Naeem, MH Rasool, M Saqalein, MA Nisar, M Rasool, M Bilal, AA Khan, M Khurshid_


The role of the human microbiome in the brain and behavioral development is an area of increasing attention. Recent investigations have found that diverse mechanisms and signals including the immune, endocrine and neural associations are responsible for the communication between gut microbiota and the brain. The studies have suggested that alteration of intestinal microbiota using probiotic formulations may offer a significant role in the maturation and organization of the brain and can shape the brain and behavior as well as mood and cognition in human subjects. The understanding of the possible impact of gut microflora on neurological function is a promising phenomenon that can surely transform the neurosciences and may decipher the novel etiologies for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

## The Influences of Bioinformatics Tools and Reference Databases in Analyzing the Human Oral Microbial Community.
 06.08.2020, _MA Sierra, Q Li, S Pushalkar, B Paul, TA Sandoval, AR Kamer, P Corby, Y Guo, RR Ruff, AV Alekseyenko, X Li, D Saxena_


There is currently no criterion to select appropriate bioinformatics tools and reference databases for analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon data in the human oral microbiome. Our study aims to determine the influence of multiple tools and reference databases on α-diversity measurements and β-diversity comparisons analyzing the human oral microbiome. We compared the results of taxonomical classification by Greengenes, the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 16S, SILVA, and the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and the Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm (DADA2). There were 15 phyla present in all of the analyses, four phyla exclusive to certain databases, and different numbers of genera were identified in each database. Common genera found in the oral microbiome, such as Veillonella, Rothia, and Prevotella, are annotated by all databases; however, less common genera, such as Bulleidia and Paludibacter, are only annotated by large databases, such as Greengenes. Our results indicate that using different reference databases in 16S rRNA amplicon data analysis could lead to different taxonomic compositions, especially at genus level. There are a variety of databases available, but there are no defined criteria for data curation and validation of annotations, which can affect the accuracy and reproducibility of results, making it difficult to compare data across studies.
