Oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is associated with oral microbial dysbiosis. In this unique study, we compared pre- to post-treatment salivary microbiome in patients with SCC by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and examined how microbiome changes correlated with the expression of an anti-microbial protein.

A Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiome provides the first line of defense against adverse genital tract health outcomes. However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms by which the vaginal microbiome modulates protection, as prior work mostly described its composition through morphologic assessment and marker gene sequencing methods that do not capture functional information. To address this gap, we developed metagenomic community state types (mgCSTs) which use metagenomic sequences to describe and define vaginal microbiomes based on both composition and functional potential.

The gut microbiota in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are perturbed in both composition and function. The vaginal microbiome and its role in the reproductive health of women with inflammatory bowel disease is less well described.

## Engraftment of essential functions through multiple fecal microbiota transplants in chronic antibiotic-resistant pouchitis-a case study using metatranscriptomics.

Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the standard of care after total proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis (UC). Around 50% of patients will experience pouchitis, an idiopathic inflammatory condition. Antibiotics are the backbone of treatment of pouchitis; however, antibiotic-resistant pouchitis develops in 5-10% of those patients. It has been shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for UC, but results for FMT antibiotic-resistant pouchitis are inconsistent.

## Vitamin D modulation of brain-gut-virome disorder caused by polystyrene nanoplastics exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio).

Many studies have investigated how nanoplastics (NPs) exposure mediates nerve and intestinal toxicity through a dysregulated brain-gut axis interaction, but there are few studies aimed at alleviating those effects. To determine whether and how vitamin D can impact that toxicity, fish were supplemented with a vitamin D-low diet and vitamin D-high diet.

## Diversity of gut microbiome in Rocky Mountainsnail across its native range.
 29.11.2023, _BN Chalifour, LE Elder, J Li_


_Animals, Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Bacteria, Microbiota, Soil_
The animal gut microbiome is often a key requirement for host nutrition, digestion, and immunity, and can shift in relation to host geography and environmental factors. However, ecological drivers of microbiome community assembly across large geographic ranges have rarely been examined in invertebrates. Oreohelix strigosa (Rocky Mountainsnail) is a widespread land snail found in heterogeneous environments across the mountainous western United States. It is ideally suited for biogeography studies due to its broad distribution, low migration, and low likelihood of passive transport via other animals. This study aims to uncover large-scale geographic shifts in the composition of O. strigosa gut microbiomes by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing on samples from across its native range. Additionally, we elucidate smaller-scale microbiome variation using samples collected only within Colorado. Results show that gut microbiomes vary significantly across broad geographic ranges. Several possible ecological drivers, including soil and vegetation composition, habitat complexity, habitat type, and human impact, collectively explained 27% of the variation across Coloradan O. strigosa gut microbiomes. Snail gut microbiomes show more similarity to vegetation than soil microbiomes. Gut microbial richness was highest in the rocky habitats and increased significantly in the most disturbed habitats (low complexity, high human impact), potentially indicating signs of dysbiosis in the snails' gut microbiomes. These small-scale environmental factors may be driving changes in O. strigosa gut microbiome composition seen across large-scale geography. This knowledge will also help us better understand how microbial associations influence species survival in diverse environments and aid wildlife conservation efforts.

## Core gut microbes Cloacibacterium and Aeromonas associated with different gastropod species could be persistently transmitted across multiple generations.

Studies on the gut microbiota of animals have largely focused on vertebrates. The transmission modes of commensal intestinal bacteria in mammals have been well studied. However, in gastropods, the relationship between gut microbiota and hosts is still poorly understood. To gain a better understanding of the composition of gut microbes and their transmission routes in gastropods, a large-scale and long-term experiment on the dynamics and transmission modes of gut microbiota was conducted on freshwater snails.

## Phantom oscillations in principal component analysis.
 05.12.2023, _M Shinn_


Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method that is known for being simple and easy to interpret. Principal components are often interpreted as low-dimensional patterns in high-dimensional space. However, this simple interpretation fails for timeseries, spatial maps, and other continuous data. In these cases, nonoscillatory data may have oscillatory principal components. Here, we show that two common properties of data cause oscillatory principal components: smoothness and shifts in time or space. These two properties implicate almost all neuroscience data. We show how the oscillations produced by PCA, which we call "phantom oscillations," impact data analysis. We also show that traditional cross-validation does not detect phantom oscillations, so we suggest procedures that do. Our findings are supported by a collection of mathematical proofs. Collectively, our work demonstrates that patterns which emerge from high-dimensional data analysis may not faithfully represent the underlying data.

## The MAGMA pipeline for comprehensive genomic analyses of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples.

_Humans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Phylogeny, Genomics, Genome, Tuberculosis_
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) holds great potential for the management and control of tuberculosis. Accurate analysis of samples with low mycobacterial burden, which are characterized by low (&lt;20x) coverage and high (&gt;40%) levels of contamination, is challenging. We created the MAGMA (Maximum Accessible Genome for Mtb Analysis) bioinformatics pipeline for analysis of clinical Mtb samples.
