 08.02.2022, _E Ramos da Silva, AL Ferreira Feitosa, G Trevizani Depolli, P Rufino da Silva Costa, MG Pacheco da Silva_


Objective: The present study aims to describe the clinical protocols used for administration of colostrum therapy in newborns. Methods: An integrative review was carried out in the following databases: Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Embase, Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Scopus, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and LIVIVO, using a combination of controlled terms in English, such as "Infant, Newborn," "Colostrum," and "Administration, Oral" associated with the entry terms and keywords. The selection of studies was carried out by reading titles and abstracts, through the Rayyan program to apply inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then reading them in full. Results: Five thousand eight hundred eighty-four studies were found in the databases; 15 studies were included in this review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected articles presented variations in terms of cutoff criteria regarding gestational age and weight classification, in addition to the diversification between the beginning and the end of the application of colostrum therapy. In contrast, there was a predominance of the site of administration, type of colostrum used, and time to offer maternal colostrum. Conclusions: The studies present differences in terms of clinical parameters for standardizing the procedure. Therefore, this study can contribute to the generalized implementation of colostrum therapy in neonatal units through creation of a standard operating procedure based on systematization of the analyzed studies.

## 'A landmark in psychiatric progress'? The role of evidence in the rise and fall of insulin coma therapy.
 22.12.2021, _R Freudenthal, J Moncrieff_


This paper examines the evidence behind the use and decline of insulin coma therapy as a treatment for schizophrenia and how this was viewed by the psychiatric profession. The paper demonstrates that, from the time of its introduction, there was considerable debate regarding the evidence for insulin treatment, and scepticism about its purported benefits. The randomized trials conducted in the 1950s were the result, rather than the origins, of this debate. Although insulin treatment was subsequently abandoned, it was still regarded as a historic moment in the modernization of psychiatry. Then, as now, evidence does not speak for itself, and insulin continued to be incorporated into the story of psychiatric progress even after it was shown to be ineffective.

## Rhizobiales-Specific RirA Represses a Naturally "Synthetic" Foreign Siderophore Gene Cluster To Maintain Sinorhizobium-Legume Mutualism.
 08.02.2022, _KH Liu, B Zhang, BS Yang, WT Shi, YF Li, Y Wang, P Zhang, J Jiao, CF Tian_


Iron homeostasis is strictly regulated in cellular organisms. The Rhizobiales order enriched with symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria has evolved a lineage-specific regulator, RirA, responding to iron fluctuations. However, the regulatory role of RirA in bacterium-host interactions remains largely unknown. Here, we report that RirA is essential for mutualistic interactions of Sinorhizobium fredii with its legume hosts by repressing a gene cluster directing biosynthesis and transport of petrobactin siderophore. Genes encoding an inner membrane ABC transporter (fat) and the biosynthetic machinery (asb) of petrobactin siderophore are sporadically distributed in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. An outer membrane siderophore receptor gene (fprA) was naturally assembled with asb and fat, forming a long polycistron in S. fredii. An indigenous regulation cascade harboring an inner membrane protease (RseP), a sigma factor (FecI), and its anti-sigma protein (FecR) were involved in direct activation of the fprA-asb-fat polycistron. Operons harboring fecI and fprA-asb-fat, and those encoding the indigenous TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex delivering energy to the outer membrane transport activity, were directly repressed by RirA under iron-replete conditions. The rirA deletion led to upregulation of these operons and iron overload in nodules, impaired intracellular persistence, and symbiotic nitrogen fixation of rhizobia. Mutualistic defects of the rirA mutant can be rescued by blocking activities of this naturally "synthetic" circuit for siderophore biosynthesis and transport. These findings not only are significant for understanding iron homeostasis of mutualistic interactions but also provide insights into assembly and integration of foreign machineries for biosynthesis and transport of siderophores, horizontal transfer of which is selected in microbiota. IMPORTANCE Iron is a public good explored by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The abundant ferric form is insoluble under neutral and basic pH conditions, and many bacteria secrete siderophores forming soluble ferric siderophore complexes, which can be then taken up by specific receptors and transporters. Siderophore biosynthesis and uptake machineries can be horizontally transferred among bacteria in nature. Despite increasing attention on the importance of siderophores in host-microbiota interactions, the regulatory integration process of transferred siderophore biosynthesis and transport genes is poorly understood in an evolutionary context. By focusing on the mutualistic rhizobium-legume symbiosis, here, we report how a naturally synthetic foreign siderophore gene cluster was integrated with the rhizobial indigenous regulation cascade, which is essential for maintaining mutualistic interactions.

## Mechanism of Dyspnea during Exercise in Children with Corrected Congenital Heart Disease.
 24.01.2022, _M Chlif, MM Ammar, NB Said, L Sergey, S Ahmaidi, F Alassery, H Hamam_


_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.
