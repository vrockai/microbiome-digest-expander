## Microbiota-brain interactions: Moving toward mechanisms in model organisms.
 15.10.2021, _J Nagpal, JF Cryan_


Changes in the microbiota are associated with alterations in nervous system structure-function and behavior and have been implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Most of these studies have centered on mammalian models due to their phylogenetic proximity to humans. Indeed, the germ-free mouse has been a particularly useful model organism for investigating microbiota-brain interactions. However, microbiota-brain axis research on simpler genetic model organisms with a vast and diverse scientific toolkit (zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans) is now also coming of age. In this review, we summarize the current state of microbiota-brain axis research in rodents and humans, and then we elaborate and discuss recent research on the neurobiological and behavioral effects of the microbiota in the model systems of fish, flies, and worms. We propose that a cross-species, holistic and mechanistic approach to unravel the microbiota-brain communication is an essential step toward rational microbiota-based therapeutics to combat brain disorders.

## Functional attractors in microbial community assembly.
 15.10.2021, _S Estrela, JCC Vila, N Lu, D Bajić, M Rebolleda-Gómez, CY Chang, JE Goldford, A Sanchez-Gorostiaga, Á Sánchez_


For microbiome biology to become a more predictive science, we must identify which descriptive features of microbial communities are reproducible and predictable, which are not, and why. We address this question by experimentally studying parallelism and convergence in microbial community assembly in replicate glucose-limited habitats. Here, we show that the previously observed family-level convergence in these habitats reflects a reproducible metabolic organization, where the ratio of the dominant metabolic groups can be explained from a simple resource-partitioning model. In turn, taxonomic divergence among replicate communities arises from multistability in population dynamics. Multistability can also lead to alternative functional states in closed ecosystems but not in metacommunities. Our findings empirically illustrate how the evolutionary conservation of quantitative metabolic traits, multistability, and the inherent stochasticity of population dynamics, may all conspire to generate the patterns of reproducibility and variability at different levels of organization that are commonplace in microbial community assembly.

## Bloodstream infections' origins following fecal microbiota transplantation: a strain-level analysis.
 13.10.2021, _A Eshel, I Sharon, A Nagler, D Bomze, I Danylesko, JA Fein, M Geva, I Henig, A Shimoni, T Zuckerman, I Youngster, O Koren, R Shouval_


We observed high rates of bloodstream infections (BSIs) following fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for graft-versus-host-disease (33 events in 22 patients). To trace the BSIs' origin, we applied a metagenomic bioinformatic pipeline screening donor and recipient stool samples for bacteremia-causing strains in 13 cases. Offending strains were not detected in FMT donations. Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii could be detected in stool samples before emerging in the blood. In this largest report of BSIs post-FMT, we present an approach that may be applicable for evaluating BSI origin following microbiota-based interventions. Our findings support FMT safety in immunocompromised patients but do not rule out FMT as an inducer of bacterial translocation.

## Probiotic consumption influences universal adaptive mutations in indigenous human and mouse gut microbiota.
 19.10.2021, _C Ma, C Zhang, D Chen, S Jiang, S Shen, D Huo, S Huang, Q Zhai, J Zhang_


The adaptive evolution in indigenous intestinal microbes derived from probiotics is critical to safety and efficacy evaluation of probiotics, yet it is still largely underexplored. Here, through 11 publicly accessible datasets, we demonstrated that probiotic consumption can lead to widespread single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the native microbiota. Interestingly, the same probiotic strains introduced far more SNVs in mouse gut than humans. Furthermore, the pattern of probiotics-induced SNVs was highly probiotic-strain specific, and 17 common SNVs in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii genome were identified cross studies, which might lead to changes in bacterial protein structure. Further, nearly 50% of F. prausnitzii SNVs can be inherited for six months in an independent human cohort, whereas the other half only transiently occurred. Collectively, our study substantially extended our understanding of co-evolution of the probiotics and the indigenous gut microbiota, highlighting the importance of assessment of probiotics efficacy and safety in an integrated manner.

## Does probiotics work for bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
 14.10.2021, _Y Han, QL Ren_


The different Lactobacillus strains of probiotics have been applied to the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis. The experimental data demonstrated that it works well via reducing the number of harmful bacteria, maintaining the acidic microenvironment, inhibiting the immune response, and so on, to restore the vaginal microecology. However, the clinical data indicated that it is not sufficient to support the use of probiotics in the intervention of vulvovaginal candidiasis rather than bacterial vaginosis. Hunting for novel probiotic strains and uncovering the precise mechanism of probiotics, especially with the new concept gut-vagina axis, to maintain the homeostasis of vaginal microbiota should be a great challenge in the future.

## A meta-analysis study of the robustness and universality of gut microbiome-metabolome associations.
 20.10.2021, _E Muller, YM Algavi, E Borenstein_


Microbiome-metabolome studies of the human gut have been gaining popularity in recent years, mostly due to accumulating evidence of the interplay between gut microbes, metabolites, and host health. Statistical and machine learning-based methods have been widely applied to analyze such paired microbiome-metabolome data, in the hope of identifying metabolites that are governed by the composition of the microbiome. Such metabolites can be likely modulated by microbiome-based interventions, offering a route for promoting gut metabolic health. Yet, to date, it remains unclear whether findings of microbially associated metabolites in any single study carry over to other studies or cohorts, and how robust and universal are microbiome-metabolites links.

## Specific gut microbiome signatures and the associated pro-inflamatory functions are linked to pediatric allergy and acquisition of immune tolerance.
 14.10.2021, _F De Filippis, L Paparo, R Nocerino, G Della Gatta, L Carucci, R Russo, E Pasolli, D Ercolini, R Berni Canani_


Understanding the functional potential of the gut microbiome is of primary importance for the design of innovative strategies for allergy treatment and prevention. Here we report the gut microbiome features of 90 children affected by food (FA) or respiratory (RA) allergies and 30 age-matched, healthy controls (CT). We identify specific microbial signatures in the gut microbiome of allergic children, such as higher abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and a depletion of Bifidobacterium longum, Bacteroides dorei, B. vulgatus and fiber-degrading taxa. The metagenome of allergic children shows a pro-inflammatory potential, with an enrichment of genes involved in the production of bacterial lipo-polysaccharides and urease. We demonstrate that specific gut microbiome signatures at baseline can be predictable of immune tolerance acquisition. Finally, a strain-level selection occurring in the gut microbiome of allergic subjects is identified. R. gnavus strains enriched in FA and RA showed lower ability to degrade fiber, and genes involved in the production of a pro-inflammatory polysaccharide. We demonstrate that a gut microbiome dysbiosis occurs in allergic children, with R. gnavus emerging as a main player in pediatric allergy. These findings may open new strategies in the development of innovative preventive and therapeutic approaches. Trial: NCT04750980.

## Drinking Water Source and Intake Are Associated with Distinct Gut Microbiota Signatures in US and UK Populations.
 13.10.2021, _T Vanhaecke, O Bretin, M Poirel, J Tap_


The microbiome of the digestive tract exerts fundamental roles in host physiology. Extrinsic factors including lifestyle and diet are widely recognized as key drivers of gut and oral microbiome compositions. Although drinking water is among the food items consumed in the largest amount, little is known about its potential impact on the microbiome.

## The Gut Microbiota during a Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention.
 01.10.2021, _MA Stanislawski, DN Frank, SJ Borengasser, DM Ostendorf, D Ir, P Jambal, K Bing, L Wayland, JC Siebert, DH Bessesen, PS MacLean, EL Melanson, VA Catenacci_


Altered gut microbiota has been linked to obesity and may influence weight loss. We are conducting an ongoing weight loss trial, comparing daily caloric restriction (DCR) to intermittent fasting (IMF) in adults who are overweight or obese. We report here an ancillary study of the gut microbiota and selected obesity-related parameters at the baseline and after the first three months of interventions. During this time, participants experienced significant improvements in clinical health measures, along with altered composition and diversity of fecal microbiota. We observed significant associations between the gut microbiota features and clinical measures, including weight and waist circumference, as well as changes in these clinical measures over time. Analysis by intervention group found between-group differences in the relative abundance of Akkermansia in response to the interventions. Our results provide insight into the impact of baseline gut microbiota on weight loss responsiveness as well as the early effects of DCR and IMF on gut microbiota.

## Effect of chewing betel nut on the gut microbiota of Hainanese.
 14.10.2021, _L Ying, Y Yang, J Zhou, H Huang, G Du_


Betel nut chewing (BNC) is prevalent in South Asia and Southeast Asia. BNC can affect host health by modulating the gut microbiota. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of BNC on the gut microbiota of the host. Feces samples were obtained from 34 BNC individuals from Ledong and Lingshui, Hainan, China. The microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. BNC decreased the microbial α-diversity. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla, accounting for 99.35% of the BNC group. The Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly increased in the BNC group compared to a control group. The abundances of the families Aerococcaceae, Neisseriaceae, Moraxellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Planococcaceae were decreased in the BNC/BNC_Male/BNC_Female groups compared to the control group, whereas the abundances of Coriobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, Micrococcaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Coxiellaceae, Nocardioidaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Succinivibrionaceae were increased. In general, the gut microbiome profiles suggest that BNC may have positive effects, such as an increase in the abundance of beneficial microbes and a reduction in the abundance of disease-related microbes. However, BNC may also produce an increase in the abundance of disease-related microbes. Therefore, extraction of prebiotic components could increase the beneficial value of betel nut.

_Animals, Biological Evolution, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Host Specificity, Humans, Microbiota, Phylogeny_
The trillions of microbes living in the gut-the gut microbiota-play an important role in human biology and disease. While much has been done to explore its diversity, a full understanding of our microbiomes demands an evolutionary perspective. In this review, we compare microbiomes from human populations, placing them in the context of microbes from humanity's near and distant animal relatives. We discuss potential mechanisms to generate host-specific microbiome configurations and the consequences of disrupting those configurations. Finally, we propose that this broader phylogenetic perspective is useful for understanding the mechanisms underlying human-microbiome interactions.

The bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine protects against tuberculosis and heterologous infections but elicits high inter-individual variation in specific and nonspecific, or trained, immune responses. While the gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as an important modulator of vaccine responses and immunity in general, its potential role in BCG-induced protection is largely unknown.

## Sandalwood seed oil improves insulin sensitivity in high-fat/high-sucrose diet-fed rats associated with altered intestinal microbiota and its metabolites.
 19.10.2021, _X Gao, H Zhang, K Li, Y Shi, X Guo, L Wang, D Li_


Sandalwood seed oil (SSO), rich in ximenynic acid, is extracted from the seed kernels of Santalum spicatum. The current work aimed to clarify the potential mechanisms of SSO in preventing insulin resistance (IR) by investigating the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a standard chow group (N), and four high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet-fed groups plus 7% of SSO, fish oil (FO), linseed oil (LO) or sunflower oil (SO), respectively. After 12 weeks, the feces were collected and subsequently the rats were sacrificed for collecting blood and tissues. The results indicated that the SSO, FO and LO groups had a lower ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) and lower levels of Actinobacteria phylum in their feces compared to the SO group. HOMA-IR was positively correlated with F/B (r = 0.63) and Actinobacteria (r = 0.64). At the genus level, beneficial bacteria, including Oscillospira, Clostridium, Turicibacter, Ruminococcus and Coprococcus, were more abundant, while destructive bacteria, such as Collinsella, were less abundant in the SSO group than in the SO group. The concentrations of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were higher, and the serum LPS and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) were lower in the SSO, FO and LO groups than the SO group. In addition, SCFAs were negatively (r: -0.45 to -0.82), and LPS (r: 0.12 to 0.42) and TMAO (r: 0.32 to 0.49) were positively correlated with HOMA-IR and serum IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. In summary, the prevention effect of SSO on HFHS induced IR was associated with altered intestinal microbiota composition and the production of microbial metabolites.

Winter carbon loss in northern ecosystems is estimated to be greater than the average growing season carbon uptake and is primarily driven by microbial decomposers. Viruses modulate microbial carbon cycling via induced mortality and metabolic controls, but it is unknown whether viruses are active under winter conditions (anoxic and sub-freezing temperatures).

## Metagenomic analysis provides functional insights into seasonal change of a non-cyanobacterial prokaryotic community in temperate coastal waters.

The taxonomic compositions of marine prokaryotic communities are known to follow seasonal cycles, but functional metagenomic insights into this seasonality is still limited. We analyzed a total of 22 metagenomes collected at 11 time points over a 14-month period from two sites in Sendai Bay, Japan to obtain seasonal snapshots of predicted functional profiles of the non-cyanobacterial prokaryotic community. Along with taxonomic composition, functional gene composition varied seasonally and was related to chlorophyll a concentration, water temperature, and salinity. Spring phytoplankton bloom stimulated increased abundances of putative genes that encode enzymes in amino acid metabolism pathways. Several groups of functional genes, including those related to signal transduction and cellular communication, increased in abundance during the mid- to post-bloom period, which seemed to be associated with a particle-attached lifestyle. Alternatively, genes in carbon metabolism pathways were generally more abundant in the low chlorophyll a period than the bloom period. These results indicate that changes in trophic condition associated with seasonal phytoplankton succession altered the community function of prokaryotes. Our findings on seasonal changes of predicted function provide fundamental information for future research on the mechanisms that shape marine microbial communities.

The microorganisms that inhabit food processing environments (FPE) can strongly influence the associated food quality and safety. In particular, the possibility that FPE may act as a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, and a hotspot for the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is a concern in meat processing plants. Here, we monitor microbial succession and resistome dynamics relating to FPE through a detailed analysis of a newly opened pork cutting plant over 1.5 years of activity.

Ultrasound is one of the most promising non-thermal an emerging technique in food technology. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of different ultrasonic treatments on the most important wine microbiota (Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts and lactic acid bacteria). Two stages were carried out: the assessment step, where six different ultrasonic treatments (with varying power, time, and pulses) were used on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Brettanomyces spp., and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum; and the validation step, where two chosen ultrasonic treatments were used on Zigosaccharomyces bailli, Brettanomyces spp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces bayanus, Pichia membranifaciens, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Hanseniaspora osmophila. The most sensitive microorganism was Brettanomyces spp., and the most resistant was Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. Ultrasonic treatments had varying effects on vitality (delay of growth or maximum OD reduction) and on viability (reduction of microbial growth).

## Effect of roasting conditions on cocoa bioactivity and gut microbiota modulation.

Cocoa is a highly consumed food with beneficial effects on human health. Cocoa roasting has an important influence on its sensory and nutritional characteristics; therefore, roasting could also play a role in cocoa bioactivity. Thus, the aim of this paper is to unravel the effect of cocoa roasting conditions on its antioxidant capacity and modifications of gut microbiota after in vitro digestion-fermentation. HMF and furfural, chemical markers of non-enzymatic browning, were analyzed in unroasted and roasted cocoa powder at different temperatures, as well as different chocolates. The antioxidant capacity decreased with roasting, most probably due to the loss of phenolic compounds during heating. In the case of the evaluated chocolates, the antioxidant capacity was 2-3 times higher in the fermented fraction. On the other hand, HMF and furfural content increased during roasting due to increasing temperatures. Moreover, unroasted and roasted cocoa powder have different effects on gut microbial communities. Roasted cocoa favored butyrate production, whereas unroasted cocoa favored acetate and propionate production in a significant manner. In addition, unroasted and roasted cocoa produced significantly different gut microbial communities in terms of composition. Although many bacteria were affected, Veillonella and Faecalibacterium were some of the most discriminant ones; whereas the former is a propionate producer, the latter is a butyrate producer that has also been linked to positive effects on the inflammatory health of the gut and the immune system. Therefore, unroasted and roasted cocoa (regardless of the roasting temperature) promote different bacteria and a different SCFA production.

## Recovery of strain-resolved genomes from human microbiome through an integration framework of single-cell genomics and metagenomics.
 20.10.2021, _K Arikawa, K Ide, M Kogawa, T Saeki, T Yoda, T Endoh, A Matsuhashi, H Takeyama, M Hosokawa_


Obtaining high-quality (HQ) reference genomes from microbial communities is crucial for understanding the phylogeny and function of uncultured microbes in complex microbial ecosystems. Despite improvements in bioinformatic approaches to generate curated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), existing metagenome binners obtain population consensus genomes but they are nowhere comparable to genomes sequenced from isolates in terms of strain level resolution. Here, we present a framework for the integration of single-cell genomics and metagenomics, referred to as single-cell (sc) metagenomics, to reconstruct strain-resolved genomes from microbial communities at once.

## Fast and Accurate Distance-based Phylogenetic Placement using Divide and Conquer.
 13.10.2021, _M Balaban, Y Jiang, D Roush, Q Zhu, S Mirarab_


Phylogenetic placement of query samples on an existing phylogeny is increasingly used in molecular ecology, including sample identification and microbiome environmental sampling. As the size of available reference trees used in these analyses continues to grow, there is a growing need for methods that place sequences on ultra-large trees with high accuracy. Distance-based placement methods have recently emerged as a path to provide such scalability while allowing flexibility to analyze both assembled and unassembled environmental samples. In this paper, we introduce a distance-based phylogenetic placement method, APPLES-2, that is more accurate and scalable than existing distance-based methods and even some of the leading maximum likelihood methods. This scalability is owed to a divide-and-conquer technique that limits distance calculation and phylogenetic placement to parts of the tree most relevant to each query. The increased scalability and accuracy enables us to study the effectiveness of APPLES-2 for placing microbial genomes on a data set of 10,575 microbial species using subsets of 381 marker genes. APPLES-2 has very high accuracy in this setting, placing 97% of query genomes within three branches of the optimal position in the species tree using 50 marker genes. Our proof of concept results show that APPLES-2 can quickly place metagenomic scaffolds on ultra-large backbone trees with high accuracy as long as a scaffold includes tens of marker genes. These results pave the path for a more scalable and widespread use of distance-based placement in various areas of molecular ecology.
