Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump.

## Genomic surveillance as a scalable framework for precision phage therapy against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Phage therapy is gaining increasing interest in the fight against critically antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens. However, the narrow host range of bacteriophages hampers the development of broadly effective phage therapeutics and demands precision approaches. Here, we combine large-scale phylogeographic analysis with high-throughput phage typing to guide the development of precision phage cocktails targeting carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, a top-priority pathogen. Our analysis reveals that a few strain types dominate infections in each world region, with their geographical distribution remaining stable within 6 years. As we demonstrate in Eastern Europe, this spatiotemporal distribution enables preemptive preparation of region-specific phage collections that target most local infections. Finally, we showcase the efficacy of phage cocktails against prevalent strain types using in vitro and animal infection models. Ultimately, genomic surveillance identifies patients benefiting from the same phages across geographical scales, thus providing a scalable framework for precision phage therapy.

## Schlesinger Nailed It! Assessing a Key Primary Pharmacodynamic Property of Phages for Phage Therapy: Virion Encounter Rates with Motionless Bacterial Targets.
 24.05.2024, _ST Abedon_


Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses of bacteria and have been used as antibacterial agents now for over one-hundred years. The primary pharmacodynamics of therapeutic phages can be summed up as follows: phages at a certain concentration can reach bacteria at a certain rate, attach to bacteria that display appropriate receptors on their surfaces, infect, and (ideally) kill those now-adsorbed bacteria. Here, I consider the rate at which phages reach bacteria, during what can be dubbed as an 'extracellular search'. This search is driven by diffusion and can be described by what is known as the phage adsorption rate constant. That constant in turn is thought to be derivable from knowledge of bacterial size, virion diffusion rates, and the likelihood of phage adsorption given this diffusion-driven encounter with a bacterium. Here, I consider only the role of bacterial size in encounter rates. In 1932, Schlesinger hypothesized that bacterial size can be described as a function of cell radius (R, or R1), as based on the non-phage-based theorizing of Smoluchowski (1917). The surface area of a cell-what is actually encountered-varies however instead as a function R2. Here, I both provide and review evidence indicating that Schlesinger's assertion seems to have been correct.
