## The intestinal neuro-immune axis: crosstalk between neurons, immune cells, and microbes.
 05.02.2021, _A Jacobson, D Yang, M Vella, IM Chiu_


The gastrointestinal tract is densely innervated by a complex network of neurons that coordinate critical physiological functions. Here, we summarize recent studies investigating the crosstalk between gut-innervating neurons, resident immune cells, and epithelial cells at homeostasis and during infection, food allergy, and inflammatory bowel disease. We introduce the neuroanatomy of the gastrointestinal tract, detailing gut-extrinsic neuron populations from the spinal cord and brain stem, and neurons of the intrinsic enteric nervous system. We highlight the roles these neurons play in regulating the functions of innate immune cells, adaptive immune cells, and intestinal epithelial cells. We discuss the consequences of such signaling for mucosal immunity. Finally, we discuss how the intestinal microbiota is integrated into the neuro-immune axis by tuning neuronal and immune interactions. Understanding the molecular events governing the intestinal neuro-immune signaling axes will enhance our knowledge of physiology and may provide novel therapeutic targets to treat inflammatory diseases.

## The Role of the Gut Microbiome, Immunity, and Neuroinflammation in the Pathophysiology of Eating Disorders.
 08.02.2021, _MJ Butler, AA Perrini, LA Eckel_


There is a growing recognition that both the gut microbiome and the immune system are involved in a number of psychiatric illnesses, including eating disorders. This should come as no surprise, given the important roles of diet composition, eating patterns, and daily caloric intake in modulating both biological systems. Here, we review the evidence that alterations in the gut microbiome and immune system may serve not only to maintain and exacerbate dysregulated eating behavior, characterized by caloric restriction in anorexia nervosa and binge eating in bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, but may also serve as biomarkers of increased risk for developing an eating disorder. We focus on studies examining gut dysbiosis, peripheral inflammation, and neuroinflammation in each of these eating disorders, and explore the available data from preclinical rodent models of anorexia and binge-like eating that may be useful in providing a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying eating disorders. Such knowledge is critical to developing novel, highly effective treatments for these often intractable and unremitting eating disorders.

## The microbiome and host mucosal interactions in urinary tract diseases.
 05.02.2021, _B Jones-Freeman, M Chonwerawong, VR Marcelino, AV Deshpande, SC Forster, MR Starkey_


The urinary tract consists of the bladder, ureters, and kidneys, and is an essential organ system for filtration and excretion of waste products and maintaining systemic homeostasis. In this capacity, the urinary tract is impacted by its interactions with other mucosal sites, including the genitourinary and gastrointestinal systems. Each of these sites harbors diverse ecosystems of microbes termed the microbiota, that regulates complex interactions with the local and systemic immune system. It remains unclear whether changes in the microbiota and associated metabolites may be a consequence or a driver of urinary tract diseases. Here, we review the current literature, investigating the impact of the microbiota on the urinary tract in homeostasis and disease including urinary stones, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and urinary tract infection. We propose new avenues for exploration of the urinary microbiome using emerging technology and discuss the potential of microbiome-based medicine for urinary tract conditions.

## Comparison between 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing data for the taxonomic characterization of the gut microbiota.
 07.02.2021, _F Durazzi, C Sala, G Castellani, G Manfreda, D Remondini, A De Cesare_


In this paper we compared taxonomic results obtained by metataxonomics (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and metagenomics (whole shotgun metagenomic sequencing) to investigate their reliability for bacteria profiling, studying the chicken gut as a model system. The experimental conditions included two compartments of gastrointestinal tracts and two sampling times. We compared the relative abundance distributions obtained with the two sequencing strategies and then tested their capability to distinguish the experimental conditions. The results showed that 16S rRNA gene sequencing detects only part of the gut microbiota community revealed by shotgun sequencing. Specifically, when a sufficient number of reads is available, Shotgun sequencing has more power to identify less abundant taxa than 16S sequencing. Finally, we showed that the less abundant genera detected only by shotgun sequencing are biologically meaningful, being able to discriminate between the experimental conditions as much as the more abundant genera detected by both sequencing strategies.

## Sequence Meets Function-Microbiota And Cardiovascular Disease.
 04.02.2021, _M Kim, MN Huda, BJ Bennett_


The discovery that gut-microbiota plays a profound role in human health has opened a new avenues of basic and clinical research. Application of ecological approaches where the Bacterial 16S rRNA gene is queried has provided a number of candidate bacteria associated with coronary artery disease and hypertension. We examine the associations between gut microbiota and a variety of CVD including atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease and blood pressure. These approaches are associative in nature and there is now increasing interest in identifying the mechanisms underlying these associations. We discuss three potential mechanisms including: gut permeability and endotoxemia, increased immune system activation, and microbial derived metabolites. In addition to discussing these potential mechanisms we highlight current studies manipulating the gut microbiota or microbial metabolites to move beyond sequenced based association studies. The goal of these mechanistic studies is to determine the mode of action by which the gut microbiota may affect disease susceptibility and severity. Importantly, the gut microbiota appears to have a significant effect on host metabolism and CVD by producing metabolites entering the host circulatory system such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO). Therefore, the intersection of metabolomics and microbiota research may yield novel targets to reduce disease susceptibility. Finally, we discuss approaches to demonstrate causality such as specific diet changes, inhibition of microbial pathways and fecal microbiota transplant.

## Fecal microbiota transplant overcomes resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients.
 08.02.2021, _D Davar, AK Dzutsev, JA McCulloch, RR Rodrigues, JM Chauvin, RM Morrison, RN Deblasio, C Menna, Q Ding, O Pagliano, B Zidi, S Zhang, JH Badger, M Vetizou, AM Cole, MR Fernandes, S Prescott, RGF Costa, AK Balaji, A Morgun, I Vujkovic-Cvijin, H Wang, AA Borhani, MB Schwartz, HM Dubner, SJ Ernst, A Rose, YG Najjar, Y Belkaid, JM Kirkwood, G Trinchieri, HM Zarour_


Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy provides long-term clinical benefits to patients with advanced melanoma. The composition of the gut microbiota correlates with anti-PD-1 efficacy in preclinical models and cancer patients. To investigate whether resistance to anti-PD-1 can be overcome by changing the gut microbiota, this clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of responder-derived fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) together with anti-PD-1 in patients with PD-1-refractory melanoma. This combination was well tolerated, provided clinical benefit in 6 of 15 patients, and induced rapid and durable microbiota perturbation. Responders exhibited increased abundance of taxa that were previously shown to be associated with response to anti-PD-1, increased CD8+ T cell activation, and decreased frequency of interleukin-8-expressing myeloid cells. Responders had distinct proteomic and metabolomic signatures, and transkingdom network analyses confirmed that the gut microbiome regulated these changes. Collectively, our findings show that FMT and anti-PD-1 changed the gut microbiome and reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1 in a subset of PD-1 advanced melanoma.

The gut microbiome has been shown to influence the response of tumors to anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death-1) immunotherapy in preclinical mouse models and observational patient cohorts. However, modulation of gut microbiota in cancer patients has not been investigated in clinical trials. In this study, we performed a phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and feasibility of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and reinduction of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in 10 patients with anti-PD-1-refractory metastatic melanoma. We observed clinical responses in three patients, including two partial responses and one complete response. Notably, treatment with FMT was associated with favorable changes in immune cell infiltrates and gene expression profiles in both the gut lamina propria and the tumor microenvironment. These early findings have implications for modulating the gut microbiota in cancer treatment.

## Components of a Neanderthal gut microbiome recovered from fecal sediments from El Salt.

A comprehensive view of our evolutionary history cannot ignore the ancestral features of our gut microbiota. To provide some glimpse into the past, we searched for human gut microbiome components in ancient DNA from 14 archeological sediments spanning four stratigraphic units of El Salt Middle Paleolithic site (Spain), including layers of unit X, which has yielded well-preserved Neanderthal occupation deposits dating around 50 kya. According to our findings, bacterial genera belonging to families known to be part of the modern human gut microbiome are abundantly represented only across unit X samples, showing that well-known beneficial gut commensals, such as Blautia, Dorea, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium already populated the intestinal microbiome of Homo since as far back as the last common ancestor between humans and Neanderthals.

## Meta-omics characteristics of intestinal microbiota associated to HBeAg seroconversion induced by oral antiviral therapy.

Tenofovir and entecavir are currently designated as the preferred oral antiviral drugs for chronic hepatitis B. However, only less than 40% of patients can achieve HBeAg seroconversion. We aim at investigating the role of intestinal microbiome in HBeAg seroconversion induced by oral antiviral therapy and describe multi-omics characteristics of HBeAg seroconversion associated intestinal flora. In this study, we prospectively collected fecal samples at baseline from the patients with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B who would have oral antiviral therapy. 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolomics were performed. We identified HBeAg seroconversion-related microbial signature and constructed prediction model for HBeAg seroconversion. Thirty-seven of these subjects achieved HBeAg seroconversion within 156 weeks after the initiation of oral antiviral therapy, while 41 subjects remained HBeAg positive even after over 156 weeks of therapy. A computational statistical and machine learning approach allowed us to identify a microbial signature for HBeAg seroconversion. Using random forest method, we further constructed a classifier based on the microbial signature, with area under curve being 0.749 for the test set. Patients who achieved HBeAg seroconversion tended to have lower abundance of certain fecal metabolites such as essential amino acids, and several dipeptides. By analyzing the fecal microbiota from the patients with and without HBeAg seroconversion, we showed intestinal microbiome play a critical role in HBeAg seroconversion induced by oral antiviral therapy. We also identified intestinal microbial signature that is associated with HBeAg seroconversion after oral antiviral therapy.
