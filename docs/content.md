HIV-1 infection is characterized by a massive depletion of mucosal CD4 T cells that triggers a cascade of events ultimately linking gut microbial dysbiosis to HIV-1 disease progression and pathogenesis. The association between HIV infection and the enteric virome composition is less characterized, although viruses are an essential component of the gut ecosystem. Here, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the fecal viral (eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages) and bacterial microbiome in people with HIV (PWH) and in HIV-negative individuals. To gain further insight into the association between the gut microbiome composition, HIV-associated immunodeficiency, and immune recovery, we carried out a longitudinal study including 14 PWH who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) and were followed for 24 months with samplings performed at baseline (before ART) and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months post-ART initiation.

## Vaginal lactobacilli produce anti-inflammatory β-carboline compounds.
 18.10.2024, _VJ Glick, CA Webber, LE Simmons, MC Martin, M Ahmad, CH Kim, AND Adams, S Bang, MC Chao, NC Howard, SM Fortune, M Verma, M Jost, LK Beura, MJ James, SY Lee, CM Mitchell, J Clardy, KH Kim, S Gopinath_


The optimal vaginal microbiome is a Lactobacillus-dominant community. Apart from Lactobacillus iners, the presence of Lactobacillus species is associated with reduced vaginal inflammation and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Loss of Lactobacillus-dominance is associated with inflammatory conditions, such as bacterial vaginosis (BV). We have identified that Lactobacillus crispatus, a key vaginal bacterial species, produces a family of β-carboline compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. These compounds suppress nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and interferon (IFN) signaling downstream of multiple pattern recognition receptors in primary human cells and significantly dampen type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) activation in monocytes. Topical application of an anti-inflammatory β-carboline compound, perlolyrine, was sufficient to significantly reduce vaginal inflammation in a mouse model of genital herpes infection. These compounds are enriched in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) of healthy people compared with people with BV. This study identifies a family of compounds by which vaginal lactobacilli mediate host immune homeostasis and highlights a potential therapeutic avenue for vaginal inflammation.

## SurvBal: Compositional microbiome balances for survival outcomes.
 15.10.2024, _Y Li, T Lee, K Marin, X Hua, S Srinivasan, DN Fredricks, JR Lee, W Ling_


Identification of balances of bacterial taxa in relation to continuous and dichotomous outcomes is an increasingly frequent analytic objective in microbiome profiling experiments. SurvBal enables the selection of balances in relation to censored survival or time-to-event outcomes which are of considerable interest in many biomedical studies. The most commonly used survival models-the Cox proportional hazards and parametric survival models are included in the package, which are used in combination with step-wise selection procedures to identify the optimal associated balance of microbiome, i.e., the ratio of the geometric means of two groups of taxa's relative abundances.

## q2-metnet: QIIME2 package to analyze 16S rRNA data via high-quality metabolic reconstructions of the human gut microbiota.
 17.07.2024, _F Balzerani, T Blasco, S Pérez-Burillo, MP Francino, JÁ Rufián-Henares, L Valcarcel, FJ Planes_


16S rRNA gene sequencing is the most frequent approach for the characterization of the human gut microbiota. Despite different efforts in the literature, the inference of functional and metabolic interpretations from 16S rRNA gene sequencing data is still a challenging task. High-quality metabolic reconstructions of the human gut microbiota, such as AGORA and AGREDA, constitute a curated resource to improve functional inference from 16S rRNA data, but they are not typically integrated into standard bioinformatics tools.
