## Maternal H. pylori is associated with differential fecal microbiota in infants born by vaginal delivery.
 30.04.2020, _CD Hernandez, H Shin, PA Troncoso, MH Vera, AA Villagran, SM Rodriguez-Rivera, MA Ortiz, CA Serrano, A Borzutzky, MG Dominguez-Bello, PR Harris_


Helicobacter pylori colonization may affect the mucosal immune system through modification of microbiota composition and their interactions with the host. We hypothesized that maternal H. pylori status affects the maternal intestinal microbiota of both mother and newborn. In this study, we determine the structure of the fecal microbiota in mothers and neonates according to maternal H. pylori status and delivery mode. We included 22 mothers and H. pylori infection was determined by fecal antigen test. Eleven mothers (50%) were H. pylori-positive (7 delivering vaginally and 4 by C-section), and 11 were negative (6 delivering vaginally and 5 by C-section). Stool samples were obtained from mothers and infants and the fecal DNA was sequenced. The fecal microbiota from mothers and their babies differed by the maternal H. pylori status, only in vaginal birth, not in C-section delivery. All 22 infants tested negative for fecal H. pylori at 15 days of age, but those born vaginally -and not those by C-section- showed differences in the infant microbiota by maternal H. pylori status (PERMANOVA, p = 0.01), with higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Veillonella, in those born to H. pylori-positive mothers. In conclusion, the structure of the infant fecal microbiota is affected by the maternal H. pylori status only in infants born vaginally, suggesting that the effect could be mediated by labor and birth exposures.

## The link between autism spectrum disorder and gut microbiota: A scoping review.
 28.04.2020, _A Nitschke, R Deonandan, AT Konkle_


Gastrointestinal distress and gut microbial imbalances are commonly found in children with autism spectrum disorder, and therefore may play a key role in the development of the disorder. This scoping review aimed to examine the extent, range and nature of research conducted in the past 6 years that focused on furthering our understanding of autism spectrum disorder and its association with gut microbiota. A literature review was performed with predetermined key words. Studies were screened and selected based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 19 studies were included for final analysis. While there are continuous reports of differences in gut microbiota between autism spectrum disorder and neurotypical individuals, knowledge about the consistency in the presence and abundance of bacterial species, as well as metabolites, remains deficient. Treatments such as special diets, vitamin, prebiotic, probiotic, and microbiota transfer therapy show promising therapeutic potential, yet are in their infancy of investigation. Overall, further research with rigorous methodologies is required to support and strengthen the reliability of existing findings. Future research should aim to increase sample sizes, eliminate biases, and subgroup autism spectrum disorder groups to help accommodate for inter-individual variation. As increasing evidence of a unique autism spectrum disorder microbiome and metabolome is acquired, autism spectrum disorder-specific biomarkers can be identified. These biomarkers have great implications in terms of elucidating the molecular mechanisms of autism spectrum disorder, preventing the onset of autism spectrum disorder, and improving treatments for individuals with autism spectrum disorder.

## Intestinal Dysbiosis in Carriers of Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
 30.04.2020, _H Korach-Rechtman, M Hreish, C Fried, S Gerassy-Vainberg, ZS Azzam, Y Kashi, G Berger_


Infection with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has become an important challenge in health care settings and a growing concern worldwide. Since infection is preceded by colonization, an understanding of the latter may reduce CRE infections. We aimed to characterize the gut microbiota in CRE carriers, assuming that microbiota alterations precede CRE colonization. We evaluated the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing extracted of fecal samples collected from hospitalized CRE carriers and two control groups, hospitalized noncarriers and healthy adults. The microbiota diversity and composition in CRE-colonized patients differed from those of the control group participants. These CRE carriers displayed lower phylogenetic diversity and dysbiotic microbiota, enriched with members of the family Enterobacteriaceae Concurrent with the enrichment in Enterobacteriaceae, a depletion of anaerobic commensals was observed. Additionally, changes in several predicted metabolic pathways were observed for the CRE carriers. Concomitantly, we found higher prevalence of bacteremia in the CRE carriers. Several clinical factors that might induce changes in the microbiota were examined and found to be insignificant between the groups. The compositional and functional changes in the microbiota of CRE-colonized patients are associated with increased risk for systemic infection. Our study results provide justification for attempts to restore the dysbiotic microbiota with probiotics or fecal transplantation.IMPORTANCE The gut microbiota plays important roles in the host's normal function and health, including protection against colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Alterations in the gut microbial profile can potentially serve as an early diagnostic tool, as well as a therapeutic strategy against colonization by and carriage of harmful bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Here, we show that the microbiota of hospitalized patients demonstrated specific taxa which differed between carriers of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and noncarriers. The difference in the microbiota also dictates alterations in microbiome-specific metabolic capabilities, in association with increased prevalence of systemic infection. Reintroducing specific strains and/or correction of dysbiosis with probiotics or fecal transplantation may potentially lead to colonization by bacterial taxa responsible for protection against or depletion of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

## Oral microbiome: possible harbinger for children's health.
 02.05.2020, _J Xiao, KA Fiscella, SR Gill_


The human microbiome functions as an intricate and coordinated microbial network, residing throughout the mucosal surfaces of the skin, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and reproductive system. The oral microbiome encompasses a highly diverse microbiota, consisting of over 700 microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. As our understanding of the relationship between the oral microbiome and human health has evolved, we have identified a diverse array of oral and systemic diseases associated with this microbial community, including but not limited to caries, periodontal diseases, oral cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and inflammatory bowel syndrome. The potential predictive relationship between the oral microbiota and these human diseases suggests that the oral cavity is an ideal site for disease diagnosis and development of rapid point-of-care tests. The oral cavity is easily accessible with a non-invasive collection of biological samples. We can envision a future where early life salivary diagnostic tools will be used to predict and prevent future disease via analyzing and shaping the infant's oral microbiome. In this review, we present evidence for the establishment of the oral microbiome during early childhood, the capability of using childhood oral microbiome to predict future oral and systemic diseases, and the limitations of the current evidence.

## Putting the microbiota to work: Epigenetic effects of early life antibiotic treatment are associated with immune-related pathways and reduced epithelial necrosis following Salmonella Typhimurium challenge in vitro.
 27.04.2020, _MO Costa, J Fouhse, APP Silva, B Willing, JCS Harding_


Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an animal welfare and public health concern due to its ability to parasite livestock and potentially contaminate pork products. To reduce Salmonella shedding and the risk of pork contamination, antibiotic therapy is used and can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Here we hypothesized that immune system education by the microbiota can play a role in intestinal resilience to infection. We used amoxicillin (15mg/Kg) to modulate the intestinal microbiome of 10 piglets, paired with same age pigs that received a placebo (n = 10) from 0 to 14 days of age. Animals were euthanized at 4-weeks old. Each pig donated colon sections for ex vivo culture (n = 20 explants/pig). Explants were inoculated with S. Typhimurium, PBS or LPS (n = 6 explants/pig/group, plus technical controls). The gut bacteriome was characterized by sequencing of the 16S rRNA at 7, 21 days of age, and upon in vitro culture. Explants response to infection was profiled through high-throughput mRNA sequencing. In vivo antibiotic treatment led to β-diversity differences between groups at all times (P&lt;0.05), while α-diversity did not differ between amoxicillin and placebo groups on day 21 and at euthanasia (P&lt;0.03 on day 7). Explant microbiomes were not different from in vivo. In vitro challenge with S. Typhimurium led to lower necrosis scores in explants from amoxicillin-treated pigs, when compared to explants placebo-treated pigs (P&lt;0.05). This was coupled with the activation of immune-related pathways in explants from amoxicillin-treated pigs (IL-2 production, NO production, BCR activation), when compared to placebo-treated pigs. In addition, several DNA repair and intestinal wound healing pathways were also only activated in explants from amoxicillin-treated pigs. Taken together, these findings suggest that immune education by the amoxicillin-disturbed microbiota may have contributed to mitigate intestinal lesions following pathogen exposure.

## Establishment and Stability of the Murine Oral Microbiome.
 29.04.2020, _L Abusleme, H O'Gorman, N Dutzan, T Greenwell-Wild, NM Moutsopoulos_


Commensal microbiomes exert critical functions at barrier sites. In particular, establishment of the commensal microbiome after birth dictates immune functionality and tissue homeostasis at mucosal surfaces. To investigate the establishment and stability of the oral mucosal microbiome in mice, we evaluated oral microbiome communities shortly after birth, through adulthood, and up to 1 y of life in a controlled manner, using sequential oral samples from the same mice over time. We further evaluated transmissibility of oral microbiomes from parents and during cohousing experiments and evaluated susceptibility to oral inflammatory disease in mice harboring distinct microbiomes. Our work reveals basic principles in the establishment and stability of a health-associated oral microbiome after birth and provides insights that may be important for host-microbiome experimentation in animal models.

## Compared to conventional, ecological intensive management promotes beneficial proteolytic soil microbial communities for agro-ecosystem functioning under climate change-induced rain regimes.
 30.04.2020, _M Lori, G Piton, S Symanczik, N Legay, L Brussaard, S Jaenicke, E Nascimento, F Reis, JP Sousa, P Mäder, A Gattinger, JC Clément, A Foulquier_


Projected climate change and rainfall variability will affect soil microbial communities, biogeochemical cycling and agriculture. Nitrogen (N) is the most limiting nutrient in agroecosystems and its cycling and availability is highly dependent on microbial driven processes. In agroecosystems, hydrolysis of organic nitrogen (N) is an important step in controlling soil N availability. We analyzed the effect of management (ecological intensive vs. conventional intensive) on N-cycling processes and involved microbial communities under climate change-induced rain regimes. Terrestrial model ecosystems originating from agroecosystems across Europe were subjected to four different rain regimes for 263 days. Using structural equation modelling we identified direct impacts of rain regimes on N-cycling processes, whereas N-related microbial communities were more resistant. In addition to rain regimes, management indirectly affected N-cycling processes via modifications of N-related microbial community composition. Ecological intensive management promoted a beneficial N-related microbial community composition involved in N-cycling processes under climate change-induced rain regimes. Exploratory analyses identified phosphorus-associated litter properties as possible drivers for the observed management effects on N-related microbial community composition. This work provides novel insights into mechanisms controlling agro-ecosystem functioning under climate change.

Different mulches have variable effects on soil physicochemical characteristics, bacterial and fungal communities and ecosystem functions. However, the information about soil microbial diversity, community structure and ecosystem function in tea plantation under different mulching patterns was limited. In this study, we investigated bacterial and fungal communities of tea plantation soils under polyethylene film and peanut hull mulching using high-throughput 16S rRNA and ITS rDNA gene Illumina sequencing.

## Bioprospecting and characterization of pigmented halophilic archaeal strains from Algerian hypersaline environments with analysis of carotenoids produced by Halorubrum sp. BS2.
 27.04.2020, _K Sahli, MA Gomri, J Esclapez, P Gómez-Villegas, O Ghennai, MJ Bonete, R León, K Kharroub_


A set of 110 extremely halophilic archaeal strains were isolated from seven distinct saline habitats located in different regions of Algeria. The physicochemical characterization of the samples showed that these habitats were thalassohaline. The carotenoid production from isolated strains varied from 0.1 to 3.68 µg/ml. Based on their physiological characteristics and pigment production, 43 strains were selected and identified by means of phenotypic tests and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolates corresponded to the class Halobacteria and were closely related to genera Halorubrum, Haloarcula, Haloferax, Natrinema, Halogeometricum, Haloterrigena, and Halopiger. Carotenoids of the highest producer, strain Halorubrum sp. BS2 were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Bacterioruberin and bisanhydrobacterioruberin were the predominant carotenoids. The scavenging activity of these carotenoids reached 99% at a concentration of 18 μg/ml, which was much higher than that of ascorbic acid used as a reference compound. These carotenoids also exhibited significant antibacterial activities against four human-pathogenic strains and four fish-pathogenic strains. Variations in salinity, agitation rate, temperature, and light intensity were found to influence growth and carotenoid production of Halorubrum sp. BS2. Our results suggest that halophilic archaea represent a potential source for carotenoids, which are characterized by high antioxidant and antibacterial activities.

## Incorporating Phylogenetic Information in Microbiome Differential Abundance Studies Has No Effect on Detection Power and FDR Control.
 30.04.2020, _A Bichat, J Plassais, C Ambroise, M Mariadassou_


We consider the problem of incorporating evolutionary information (e.g., taxonomic or phylogenic trees) in the context of metagenomics differential analysis. Recent results published in the literature propose different ways to leverage the tree structure to increase the detection rate of differentially abundant taxa. Here, we propose instead to use a different hierarchical structure, in the form of a correlation-based tree, as it may capture the structure of the data better than the phylogeny. We first show that the correlation tree and the phylogeny are significantly different before turning to the impact of tree choice on detection rates. Using synthetic data, we show that the tree does have an impact: smoothing p-values according to the phylogeny leads to equal or inferior rates as smoothing according to the correlation tree. However, both trees are outperformed by the classical, non-hierarchical, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure in terms of detection rates. Other procedures may use the hierarchical structure with profit but do not control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) a priori and remain inferior to a classical Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with the same nominal FDR. On real datasets, no hierarchical procedure had significantly higher detection rate that BH. Intuition advocates that the use of hierarchical structures should increase the detection rate of differentially abundant taxa in microbiome studies. However, our results suggest that current hierarchical procedures are still inferior to standard methods and more effective procedures remain to be invented.
