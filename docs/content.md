The gut microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed to map the CRC mucosal microbiota and metabolome and define the influence of the tumoral microbiota on oncological outcomes.

Rock-dwelling microorganisms are key players in ecosystem functioning of Antarctic ice free-areas. Yet, little is known about their diversity and ecology, and further still, viruses in these communities have been largely unexplored despite important roles related to host metabolism and nutrient cycling. To begin to address this, we present a large-scale viral catalog from Antarctic rock microbial communities.

## Genomic insights into cryptic cycles of microbial hydrocarbon production and degradation in contiguous freshwater and marine microbiomes.

Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton produce long-chain alkanes and generate around 100 times greater quantities of hydrocarbons in the ocean compared to natural seeps and anthropogenic sources. Yet, these compounds do not accumulate in the water column, suggesting rapid biodegradation by co-localized microbial populations. Despite their ecological importance, the identities of microbes involved in this cryptic hydrocarbon cycle are mostly unknown. Here, we identified genes encoding enzymes involved in the hydrocarbon cycle across the salinity gradient of a remote, vertically stratified, seawater-containing High Arctic lake that is isolated from anthropogenic petroleum sources and natural seeps. Metagenomic analysis revealed diverse hydrocarbon cycling genes and populations, with patterns of variation along gradients of light, salinity, oxygen, and sulfur that are relevant to freshwater, oceanic, hadal, and anoxic deep sea ecosystems.
