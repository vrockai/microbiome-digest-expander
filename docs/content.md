_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## The phyllosphere microbiome shifts toward combating melanose pathogen.
 05.04.2022, _PD Li, ZR Zhu, Y Zhang, J Xu, H Wang, Z Wang, H Li_


_Bacteria, Melanosis, Microbiota, Plant Leaves, Rhizosphere_
Plants can recruit beneficial microbes to enhance their ability to defend against pathogens. However, in contrast to the intensively studied roles of the rhizosphere microbiome in suppressing plant pathogens, the collective community-level change and effect of the phyllosphere microbiome in response to pathogen invasion remains largely elusive.

## Next-generation sequencing: insights to advance clinical investigations of the microbiome.
 04.04.2022, _CR Wensel, JL Pluznick, SL Salzberg, CL Sears_


_High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Humans, Metagenomics, Microbiota, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S, Sequence Analysis, RNA_
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has advanced our understanding of the human microbiome by allowing for the discovery and characterization of unculturable microbes with prediction of their function. Key NGS methods include 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The choice of which NGS methodology to pursue for a given purpose is often unclear for clinicians and researchers. In this Review, we describe the fundamentals of NGS, with a focus on 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We also discuss pros and cons of each methodology as well as important concepts in data variability, study design, and clinical metadata collection. We further present examples of how NGS studies of the human microbiome have advanced our understanding of human disease pathophysiology across diverse clinical contexts, including the development of diagnostics and therapeutics. Finally, we share insights as to how NGS might further be integrated into and advance microbiome research and clinical care in the coming years.

## Metagenomics-enabled microbial surveillance.
 05.04.2022, _KKK Ko, KR Chng, N Nagarajan_


_Animals, COVID-19, Humans, Metagenomics, Pandemics, Viruses, Zoonoses_
Lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic include increased awareness of the potential for zoonoses and emerging infectious diseases that can adversely affect human health. Although emergent viruses are currently in the spotlight, we must not forget the ongoing toll of morbidity and mortality owing to antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens and to vector-borne, foodborne and waterborne diseases. Population growth, planetary change, international travel and medical tourism all contribute to the increasing frequency of infectious disease outbreaks. Surveillance is therefore of crucial importance, but the diversity of microbial pathogens, coupled with resource-intensive methods, compromises our ability to scale-up such efforts. Innovative technologies that are both easy to use and able to simultaneously identify diverse microorganisms (viral, bacterial or fungal) with precision are necessary to enable informed public health decisions. Metagenomics-enabled surveillance methods offer the opportunity to improve detection of both known and yet-to-emerge pathogens.

## Identification of Key Genes and Pathways in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus by Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.
 05.04.2022, _X Li, M Liao, J Guan, L Zhou, R Shen, M Long, J Shao_


The onset and progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is closely related to autoimmunity. Effective monitoring of the immune system and developing targeted therapies are frontier fields in T1DM treatment. Currently, the most available tissue that reflects the immune system is peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Thus, the aim of this study was to identify key PBMC biomarkers of T1DM.

## Topological band transition between hexagonal and triangular lattices with (px, py) orbitals.
 05.04.2022, _X Hao, W Wu, J Zhu, B Song, Q Meng, M Wu, C Hua, SA Yang, M Zhou_


By combining tight-binding modelling with density functional theory based first-principles calculations, we investigate the band evolution of two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal lattices with (px, py) orbitals, focusing on the electronic structures and topological phase transitions. The (px, py)-orbital hexagonal lattice model possesses two flat bands encompassing two linearly dispersive Dirac bands. Breaking the A/B sublattice symmetry could transform the model into two triangular lattices, each featuring a flat band and a dispersive band. Inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling and magnetization may give rise to quantum spin Hall (QSH) and quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that half-hydrogenated stanene is encoded by a triangular lattice with (px, py) orbitals, which exhibits ferromagnetism and QAH effect with a topological gap of ~0.15 eV, feasible for experimental observation. These results provide fundamental insights into the structure-property relationships involving the orbital degree of freedom, which may shed light on future design and preparation of 2D topological materials for novel electronic/spintronic and quantum computing devices.

## ARBRE: Computational resource to predict pathways towards industrially important aromatic compounds.
 05.04.2022, _A Sveshnikova, H MohammadiPeyhani, V Hatzimanikatis_


Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering rely on computational search tools for predictions of novel biosynthetic pathways to industrially important compounds, many of which are derived from aromatic amino acids. Pathway search tools vary in their scope of covered reactions and compounds, as well as in metrics for ranking and evaluation. In this work, we present a new computational resource called ARBRE: Aromatic compounds RetroBiosynthesis Repository and Explorer. It consists of a comprehensive biochemical reaction network centered around aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and a computational toolbox for navigating this network. ARBRE encompasses over 33'000 known and 390'000 novel reactions predicted with generalized enzymatic reactions rules and over 74'000 compounds, of which 19'000 are known to biochemical databases and 55'000 only to PubChem. Over 1'000 molecules that were solely part of the PubChem database before and were previously impossible to integrate into a biochemical network are included into the ARBRE reaction network by assigning enzymatic reactions. ARBRE can be applied for pathway search, enzyme annotation, pathway ranking, visualization, and network expansion around known biochemical pathways and products of lignin degradation to predict valuable compound derivations. In line with the standards of open science, we have made the toolbox freely available to the scientific community on git (https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/ARBRE) and we provide the web-version at http://lcsb-databases.epfl.ch/arbre/. We envision that ARBRE will provide the community with a new computational resource and comprehensive search tool to predict and rank pathways towards industrially important aromatic compounds.
