Targeted strategies are central to increasing HIV-status awareness and progress on the care cascade among men. We implemented Village-Health-Team (VHT)-delivered HIV self-testing (HIVST) among men in a peri-urban Ugandan district and assessed linkage to confirmatory-testing, antiretroviral-therapy (ART) initiation and HIV-status disclosure following HIVST. We conducted a prospective cohort study from November 2018 to June 2019 and enrolled 1628 men from 30-villages of Mpigi district. VHTs offered each participant one HIVST-kit and a linkage-to-care information leaflet. At baseline, we collected data on demographics, testing history and risk behavior. At one-month, we measured linkage to confirmatory-testing and HIV-status disclosure, and at three months ART-initiation if tested HIV-positive. We used Poisson regression generalized estimating equations to evaluate predictors of confirmatory-testing. We found that 19.8% had never tested for HIV and 43% had not tested in the last 12-months. After receiving HIVST-kits, 98.5% self-reported HIVST-uptake in 10-days, 78.8% obtained facility-based confirmation in 30-days of HIVST with 3.9% tested HIV-positive. Of the positives, 78.8% were newly diagnosed, 88% initiated ART and 57% disclosed their HIV-status to significant others. Confirmatory testing was associated with having a higher level of education and knowing a partner's HIV-status. VHT-delivered HIVST may be effective for boosting testing, ART-initiation and HIV-status disclosure among men.

_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Existing and Developing Preclinical Models for Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Related Cutaneous Neurofibromas.
 18.06.2023, _V Staedtke, P Topilko, LQ Le, K Grimes, DA Largaespada, RL Cagan, MR Steensma, A Stemmer-Rachamimov, JO Blakeley, SD Rhodes, I Ly, CG Romo, SY Lee, E Serra_


Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is caused by a nonfunctional copy of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene that predisposes patients to the development of cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), the skin tumor that is the hallmark of this condition. Innumerable benign cNFs, each appearing by an independent somatic inactivation of the remaining functional NF1 allele, form in nearly all patients with NF1. One of the limitations in developing a treatment for cNFs is an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and limitations in experimental modeling. Recent advances in preclinical in vitro and in vivo modeling have substantially enhanced our understanding of cNF biology and created unprecedented opportunities for therapeutic discovery. We discuss the current state of cNF preclinical in vitro and in vivo model systems, including two- and three-dimensional cell cultures, organoids, genetically engineered mice, patient-derived xenografts, and porcine models. We highlight the models' relationship to human cNFs and how they can be used to gain insight into cNF development and therapeutic discovery.

## Determination of Tr1 cell populations correlating with distinct activation states in acute IAV infection.
 15.06.2023, _CA Abbott, EL Freimayer, TS Tyllis, TS Norton, M Alsharifi, A H S Heng, SM Pederson, Z Qu, M Armstrong, GR Hill, SR McColl, I Comerford_


Type I regulatory (Tr1) cells are defined as FOXP3-IL-10-secreting CD4+ T cells that contribute to immune suppression and typically express the markers LAG-3 and CD49b and other co-inhibitory receptors. These cells have not been studied in detail the context of the resolution of acute infection in the lung. Here, we identify FOXP3-IL-10+ CD4+ T cells transiently accumulating in the lung parenchyma during resolution of the response to sublethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice. These cells were dependent on IL-27Rα, which was required for timely recovery from IAV-induced weight loss. LAG-3 and CD49b were not generally co-expressed by FOXP3- IL-10+ CD4+ T cells in this model and four populations of these cells based on LAG-3 and CD49b co-expression were apparent (LAG-3-CD49b- [DN], LAG-3+CD49b+ [DP], LAG-3+CD49b- [LAG-3+], LAG-3-CD49b+ [CD49b+]). However, each population exhibited suppressive potential consistent with the definition of Tr1 cells. Notably, differences between these populations of Tr1 cells were apparent including differential dependence on IL-10 to mediate suppression and expression of markers indicative of different activation states and terminal differentiation. Sort-transfer experiments indicated that LAG-3+ Tr1 cells exhibited the capacity to convert to DN and DP Tr1 cells, indicative of plasticity between these populations. Together, these data determine the features and suppressive potential of Tr1 cells in the resolution of IAV infection and identify four populations delineated by LAG-3 and CD49b, which likely correspond to different Tr1 cell activation states.

## Obesity: Policy and Practice Recommendations for High-Risk Populations Influenced by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
 22.12.2022, _KN Robinson, DA Saber_


_Humans, United States, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Pandemics, Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype, Obesity, Policy_
Obesity has been linked to higher morbidity and mortality in those that contract novel viruses, such as H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2. Loss of life and the high cost of obesity highlight the need to focus on preventative measures. The state of Maine (United States) is profiled as a rural state with high rates of obesity and low health literacy that benefits from programs to improve health. However, more multidirectional efforts are needed. Four recommendations for building a healthier, more resilient patient population are discussed here: (i) state incentives and subsidies, (ii) employers to incentivize healthy living, (iii) federal incentives and initiatives, and (iv) personal responsibility for health and wellness.

## Guild and Niche Determination Enable Targeted Alteration of the Microbiome.
 30.05.2023, _O Moyne, M Al-Bassam, C Lieng, D Thiruppathy, GJ Norton, M Kumar, E Haddad, LS Zaramela, K Zengler_


Microbiome science has greatly contributed to our understanding of microbial life and its essential roles for the environment and human health 1-5 . However, the nature of microbial interactions and how microbial communities respond to perturbations remains poorly understood, resulting in an often descriptive and correlation-based approach to microbiome research 6-8 . Achieving causal and predictive microbiome science would require direct functional measurements in complex communities to better understand the metabolic role of each member and its interactions with others. In this study we present a new approach that integrates transcription and translation measurements to predict competition and substrate preferences within microbial communities, consequently enabling the selective manipulation of the microbiome. By performing metatranscriptomic (metaRNA-Seq) and metatranslatomic (metaRibo-Seq) analysis in complex samples, we classified microbes into functional groups (i.e. guilds) and demonstrated that members of the same guild are competitors. Furthermore, we predicted preferred substrates based on importer proteins, which specifically benefited selected microbes in the community (i.e. their niche) and simultaneously impaired their competitors. We demonstrated the scalability of microbial guild and niche determination to natural samples and its ability to successfully manipulate microorganisms in complex microbiomes. Thus, the approach enhances the design of pre- and probiotic interventions to selectively alter members within microbial communities, advances our understanding of microbial interactions, and paves the way for establishing causality in microbiome science.

## Index of cardiac-electrophysiological balance in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients treated with fingolimod.
 18.06.2023, _S Gunay-Polatkan, G Gullu, D Sigirli, ER Koc, A Aydinlar, OF Turan_


Fingolimod is indicated for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and also targets cardiovascular system due to receptors on cardiomyocytes. Results of previous studies are controversial for the effect of fingolimod in terms of ventricular arrhythmias. Index of cardio-electrophysiological balance (iCEB) is a risk marker for predicting malignant ventricular arrhythmia. There is no evidence on the effect of fingolimod on iCEB in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The aim of this study was to evaluate iCEB in patients with RRMS treated with fingolimod .

Currently, infertility affects 8-12% of reproductive age couples worldwide, a problem that also affects women suffering from recurrent implantation failure (RIF). RIF is a complex condition resulting from many physiological and molecular mechanisms involving dynamic endometrium-blastocyst interaction. The most important are the endometrial receptivity process, decidualization, trophoblast invasion, and blastocyst nesting. Although the exact multifactorial pathogenesis of RIF remains unclear, many studies have suggested the association between hormone level imbalance, disturbances of angiogenic and immunomodulatory factors, certain genetic polymorphisms, and occurrence of RIF. These studies were performed in quite small groups. Additionally, the results are inconsistent between ethnicities. The present review briefly summarizes the importance of factors involved in RIF development that could also serve as diagnostic determinants. Moreover, our review could constitute part of a new platform for discovery of novel diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for RIF.

## Therapy of replenishing and regulating for manic episode in bipolar disorder: study protocol for a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.
 16.06.2023, _Y Yang, Y Haining, J Hongxiao, N Yanzhe, W Di, Z Lei, Y Kaijuan, G Yumeng, W Fei, S Weishuang, C Pei_


_Humans, Adolescent, Bipolar Disorder, Mania, Quality of Life, Prospective Studies, Double-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic_
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and recurrent disorder characterized by biphasic mood episodes of mania or hypomania and depression. It affects more than 1% of the global population and is a leading cause of disability in young people. Currently available treatments for BD are still fairly limited in terms of efficacy, with high rates of non-adherence, non-response, and undesirable side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history and rich experience in stabilizing mania and improving quality of life. Aiming at rebalancing and in BD, therapy of replenishing and regulating (RYRY therapy) has been in clinical use for years in China. The present prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of RYRY therapy for bipolar mania and its possible mechanism from the point of regulating gut microbiota and anti-inflammation. A total of 60 eligible participants will be recruited from Beijing Anding Hospital. They will be randomized to either the study group or the control group in a ratio of 1∶1. Participants allocated to the study group will receive RYRY granule, while placebo granule will be applied in the control group. Participants in both groups will be prescribed conventional therapy for manic episode in BD. Four scheduled visits will be conducted over 4 weeks. Outcome measurements include Young Mania Rating Scale, TCM Symptom Pattern Rating Scale, Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale, levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α and the gut microbial community profile of stool samples. Safety outcomes and adverse events will also be recorded. In this study, we set a number of scientific and objective assessments to evaluate the efficacy of RYRY therapy and study into its possible mechanism, hopefully offering clinicians an alternative approach to BD.

## [Characteristics and physiologic role of female lower genital microbiome].
 18.06.2023, _M Marschalkó, L Ambrus_


Vaginal microbiome is substantial in the maintenance of vaginal health and defense against pathogenic microorganisms. New techniques, including next-generation sequencing broadened our knowledge with new findings on the composition and functions of the vaginal microbiome. Improvement of laboratory techniques provides a better understanding of the diverse patterns of the vaginal microbiome in reproductive-age women and their longitudinal changes in both healthy and dysbiotic conditions. The objective of this review was to summarize the basic learning of the vaginal microbiome. In the era of traditional cultivation-dependent techniques, the role of Lactobacilli in maintenance of the vaginal homeostasis, in lactic acid and various antimicrobial compounds production and in genital defense has been delineated. Much of our knowledge about the healthy microbial flora comes from cultivation-independent molecular-based techniques. The vaginal microbiome alters throughout a woman's life, its function develops fully in reproductive age. Healthy vaginal flora typically shows Lactobacillus predominance with a pH lower than 4.5, the healthy flora is dominated by one or two species of Lactobacillus, predominantly L. crispatus, L. iners, L. gasseri, L. jensenii. The review provides background on the 5 community state types of Lactobacillus communities, their characteristics, demographic occurrence, the type shifts, the terminal changes of the dominant bacterial communities, and the comparison of them to non-Lactobacillus dominated healthy microbiomes. The microbiome contributes to the local immune response of the vaginal mucous membrane, in defense to pathogens and maintenance of immunologic tolerance to physiologic changes. Bacterial vaginosis is a clinical syndrome characterized by pathologic vaginal microbiome, Lactobacillus community decreased in abundance and replaced by different anaerobes with great diversity. In pregnant women, bacterial vaginosis increases the risk of miscarriage, abortion, preterm birth, chorioamnionitis and endometritis. In non-pregnant women, bacterial vaginosis is associated with an increased risk of upper genital tract and urinary tract infections. Women with bacterial vaginosis are more sensitive to sexually transmitted infections and acquisition of HIV. Women with bacterial vaginosis may transmit HIV virus to their partner and newborn.

## Trends in reported illness due to poultry- and nonpoultry associated Salmonella serotypes; United States 1996-2019.
 18.06.2023, _MR Powell_


Retrospective review is a key to designing effective food safety measures. Despite the reported reduction of Salmonella prevalence in poultry products, there has not been a concomitant reduction of the overall incidence of Salmonella illnesses reported to the US Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) since 1996. However, there have been significant annual trends among Salmonella serotypes. This analysis examines trends in the reported incidence of illness due to poultry- and nonpoultry associated Salmonella serotypes. Overall, the findings indicate declining trends in illness due to the poultry-associated serotypes and increasing trends in illness due to Salmonella serotypes not associated with poultry.

## Gut microbiota and cognitive development in infant mice: Quantity and source of potable water.
 16.06.2023, _CS Kim, DM Shin_


_Animals, Mice, Drinking Water, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Dehydration, Cognition, Cognitive Dysfunction, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes_
Not only the water quantity consumed but also the source of drinking water has been considered for their health benefits, but there is limited evidence. We aimed to determine whether the amount and type of drinking water affect physiological and biological functions, including brain function, by confirming how it affects gut microbiota which has an important regulatory role in host physiology. Three-week-old infant mice were subjected to 1) a water restriction experiment (control group, ad libitum consumption of distilled water; dehydration group, time-limited access to distilled water [15 min/day]) and 2) different water source experiment (distilled water, purified water, spring water, and tap water groups). The gut microbiota and cognitive development were analyzed using the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing method and the Barnes maze, respectively. The relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) changed depending on age (juveniles vs. infants). Insufficient water intake reversed these developmental changes, showing that the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and the F/B ratio in dehydrated juvenile mice were similar to those in normal infant mice. Additionally, clustering analysis revealed no significant differences in the intestinal flora in the mice from the different drinking water sources; however, dehydration significantly altered the composition of the genera compared to the other water source groups wherein water was provided ad libitum. Moreover, cognitive development was significantly disrupted by insufficient water intake, although the type of drinking water had no significant influence. Cognitive decline, measured by relative latency, was positively associated with the relative abundance of unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae that were in significantly high relative abundance in the dehydration group. These results suggest that the water quantity consumed, rather than the mineral content of drinking water, is imperative for shaping the early gut microbiota associated with cognitive development during infancy.

_Herbivory, Biomass, Microbiota, Nutrients, Soil_
All multicellular organisms host a diverse microbiome composed of microbial pathogens, mutualists, and commensals, and changes in microbiome diversity or composition can alter host fitness and function. Nonetheless, we lack a general understanding of the drivers of microbiome diversity, in part because it is regulated by concurrent processes spanning scales from global to local. Global-scale environmental gradients can determine variation in microbiome diversity among sites, however an individual host's microbiome also may reflect its local micro-environment. We fill this knowledge gap by experimentally manipulating two potential mediators of plant microbiome diversity (soil nutrient supply and herbivore density) at 23 grassland sites spanning global-scale gradients in soil nutrients, climate, and plant biomass. Here we show that leaf-scale microbiome diversity in unmanipulated plots depended on the total microbiome diversity at each site, which was highest at sites with high soil nutrients and plant biomass. We also found that experimentally adding soil nutrients and excluding herbivores produced concordant results across sites, increasing microbiome diversity by increasing plant biomass, which created a shaded microclimate. This demonstration of consistent responses of microbiome diversity across a wide range of host species and environmental conditions suggests the possibility of a general, predictive understanding of microbiome diversity.

## Gut and oral microbiome modulate molecular and clinical markers of schizophrenia-related symptoms: A transdiagnostic, multilevel pilot study.

Although increasing evidence links microbial dysbiosis with the risk for psychiatric symptoms through the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA), the specific mechanisms remain poorly characterized. In a diagnostically heterogeneous group of treated psychiatric cases and nonpsychiatric controls, we characterized the gut and oral microbiome, plasma cytokines, and hippocampal inflammatory processes via proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI). Using a transdiagnostic approach, these data were examined in association with schizophrenia-related symptoms measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Psychiatric cases had significantly greater heterogeneity of gut alpha diversity and an enrichment of pathogenic taxa, like Veillonella and Prevotella, in the oral microbiome, which was an accurate classifier of phenotype. Cases exhibited significantly greater positive, negative, and general PANSS scores that uniquely correlated with bacterial taxa. Strong, positive correlations of bacterial taxa were also found with cytokines and hippocampal gliosis, dysmyelination, and excitatory neurotransmission. This pilot study supports the hypothesis that the MGBA influences psychiatric symptomatology in a transdiagnostic manner. The relative importance of the oral microbiome in peripheral and hippocampal inflammatory pathways was highlighted, suggesting opportunities for probiotics and oral health to diagnose and treat psychiatric conditions.

## Does the high biodiversity of lactococcal bacteriophages allow predictions about their different UV-C susceptibilities?
 18.06.2023, _C Schubert, N Biere, E Brinks, M Samtlebe, H Neve, CMAP Franz, J Hinrichs, Z Atamer_


Fermentation processes can only succeed if intact and active starter cultures are present. Bacteriophages, which can lyse bacteria and thus bring entire fermentation processes to a standstill, therefore pose a major threat. Cheese production, for example, is often affected. The by-product whey can be highly contaminated with bacteriophages (≤109 plaque-forming units/mL) and in this state, further utilization is a quality and processing risk. Therefore, an orthogonal process consisting of membrane filtration followed by UV-C irradiation could be applied to eliminate bacteriophages and to generate "phage-free" whey. In order to define suitable process parameters, 11 lactococcal bacteriophages belonging to different families and genera and differing in their morphology, genome size, heat resistance, and other attributes, were screened for their UV-C resistance in whey. P369 was found to be the most resistant and could thus be well-suited as a biomarker. Starting from a 4 log unit bacteriophage reduction by membrane filtration, another 5 log unit decrease should be realized when applying a UV-C dose of 5 J/cm2. A clear correlation of UV-C sensitivity to the chosen attributes studied such as bacteriophage morphology and genome size was difficult and ambiguous, presumably because other yet unidentified parameters are important. Mutation experiments were performed with the representative bacteriophage P008 by multiple cycles of UV-C irradiation and propagation. A few mutational events were found, but could not be linked to an artificially generated UV-C resistance, indicating that the process used would probably not lose its effectiveness over time.

## Application of green synthesized bimetallic nZVI-Cu nanoparticle as a sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers to enhance growth and photosynthetic efficiency of rice seedlings.
 18.06.2023, _S Dey, S Nath, T Alam Ansari, A Biswas, F Barman, S Mukherjee, G Gopal, A Bhattacharyya, A Mukherjee, R Kundu, S Paul_


Application of nanomaterials in agriculture has been extensively explored over the past decade leading to a wide ambit of nanoparticle-based agrochemicals. Metallic nanoparticles consisting of plant macro- and micro-nutrients have been used as nutritional supplements for plants through soil amendments, foliar sprays, or seed treatment. However, most of these studies emphasize monometallic nanoparticles which limit the range of usage and effectivity of such nanoparticles (NPs). Hence, we have employed a bimetallic nanoparticle (BNP) consisting of two different micro-nutrients (Cu &amp; Fe) in rice plants to test its efficacy in terms of growth and photosynthesis. Several experiments were designed to assess growth (root-shoot length, relative water content) and photosynthetic parameters (pigment content, relative expression of rbcS, rbcL &amp; ChlGetc.). To determine whether the treatment induced any oxidative stress or structural anomalies within the plant cells, histochemical staining, anti-oxidant enzyme activities, FTIR, and SEM micrographs were undertaken. Results indicated that foliar application of 5 mg L-1 BNP increased vigor and photosynthetic efficiency whereas 10 mg L-1 concentration induced oxidative stress to some extent. Furthermore, the BNP treatment did not perturb the structural integrity of the exposed plant parts and also did not induce any cytotoxicity. Application of BNPs in agriculture has not been explored extensively to date and this study is one of the first reports that not only documents the effectivity of Cu-Fe BNP but also critically explores the safety of its usage on rice plants making it a useful lead to design new BNPs and explore their efficacy.

## 5300-Year-old soil carbon is less primed than young soil organic matter.
 22.01.2023, _J Su, H Zhang, X Han, R Lv, L Liu, Y Jiang, H Li, Y Kuzyakov, C Wei_


_Soil, Carbon, Nitrogen, Soil Microbiology, Glucose_
Soils harbor more than three times as much carbon (C) as the atmosphere, a large fraction of which (stable organic matter) serves as the most important global C reservoir due to its long residence time. Litter and root inputs bring fresh organic matter (FOM) into the soil and accelerate the turnover of stable C pools, and this phenomenon is termed the "priming effect" (PE). Compared with knowledge about labile soil C pools, very little is known about the vulnerability of stable C to priming. Using two soils that substantially differed in age (500 and 5300 years before present) and in the degree of chemical recalcitrance and physical protection of soil organic matter (SOM), we showed that leaf litter amendment primed 264% more organic C from the young SOM than from the old soil with very stable C. Hierarchical partitioning analysis confirmed that SOM stability, reflected mainly by available C and aggregate protection of SOM, is the most important predictor of leaf litter-induced PE. The addition of complex FOM (i.e., leaf litter) caused a higher bacterial oligotroph/copiotroph (K-/r-strategists) ratio, leading to a PE that was 583% and 126% greater than when simple FOM (i.e., glucose) was added to the young and old soils, respectively. This implies that the PE intensity depends on the chemical similarity between the primer (here FOM) and SOM. Nitrogen (N) mining existed when N and simple FOM were added (i.e., Glucose+N), and N addition raised the leaf litter-induced PE in the old soil that had low N availability, which was well explained by the microbial stoichiometry. In conclusion, the PE induced by FOM inputs strongly decreases with increasing SOM stability. However, the contribution of stable SOM to CO2 efflux cannot be disregarded due to its huge pool size.

## Divergence in cell cycle progression is associated with shifted phenology in a multivoltine moth: the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis.
 15.06.2023, _Q Xia, C Chen, EB Dopman, DA Hahn_


_Animals, Moths, Zea mays, Larva, Diapause, Cell Division_
Evolutionary change in diapause timing can be an adaptive response to changing seasonality, and even result in ecological speciation. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating shifts in diapause timing remain poorly understood. One of the hallmarks of diapause is a massive slowdown in the cell cycle of target organs such as the brain and primordial imaginal structures, and resumption of cell cycle proliferation is an indication of diapause termination and resumption of development. Characterizing cell cycle parameters between lineages differing in diapause life history timing may help identify molecular mechanisms associated with alterations of diapause timing. We tested the extent to which progression of the cell cycle differs across diapause between two genetically distinct European corn borer strains that differ in their seasonal diapause timing. We show the cell cycle slows down during larval diapause with a significant decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase. Brain-subesophageal complex cells slow primarily in G0/G1 phase whereas most wing disc cells are in G2 phase. Diapausing larvae of the earlier emerging, bivoltine E-strain (BE) suppressed cell cycle progression less than the later emerging, univoltine Z-strain (UZ) individuals, with a greater proportion of cells in S phase across both tissues during diapause. Additionally, resumption of cell cycle proliferation occurred earlier in the BE strain than in the UZ strain after exposure to diapause-terminating conditions. We propose that regulation of cell cycle progression rates ultimately drives differences in larval diapause termination, and adult emergence timing, between early- and late-emerging European corn borer strains.

The majority of the current regulatory practices for routine monitoring of beach water quality rely on the culture-based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) to develop criteria for promoting the general public's health. To address the limitations of culture methods and the arguable reliability of FIB in indicating health risks, we developed a Nanopore metagenomic sequencing-based viable cell absolute quantification workflow to rapidly and accurately estimate a broad range of microbes in beach waters by a combination of propidium monoazide (PMA) and cellular spike-ins. Using the simple synthetic bacterial communities mixed with viable and heat-killed cells, we observed near-complete relic DNA removal by PMA with minimal disturbance to the composition of viable cells, demonstrating the feasibility of PMA treatment in profiling viable cells by Nanopore sequencing. On a simple mock community comprised of 15 prokaryotic species, our results showed high accordance between the expected and estimated concentrations, suggesting the accuracy of our method in absolute quantification. We then further assessed the accuracy of our method for counting viable Escherichia coli and Vibrio spp. in beach waters by comparing to culture-based method, which were also in high agreement. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 1 Gb sequences obtained within 2 h would be sufficient to quantify a species having a concentration of ≥ 10 cells/mL in beach waters. Using our viability-resolved quantification workflow to assess the microbial risk of the beach water, we conducted (1) screening-level quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to investigate human illness risk and site-specific risk patterns that might guide risk management efforts and (2) metagenomics-based resistome risk assessment to evaluate another layer of risk caused by difficult illness treatment due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In summary, our metagenomic workflow for the rapid absolute quantification of viable bacteria demonstrated its great potential in paving new avenues toward holistic microbial risk assessment.

## ResFinderFG v2.0: a database of antibiotic resistance genes obtained by functional metagenomics.
 19.05.2023, _R Gschwind, S Ugarcina Perovic, M Weiss, M Petitjean, J Lao, LP Coelho, E Ruppé_


Metagenomics can be used to monitor the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). ARGs found in databases such as ResFinder and CARD primarily originate from culturable and pathogenic bacteria, while ARGs from non-culturable and non-pathogenic bacteria remain understudied. Functional metagenomics is based on phenotypic gene selection and can identify ARGs from non-culturable bacteria with a potentially low identity shared with known ARGs. In 2016, the ResFinderFG v1.0 database was created to collect ARGs from functional metagenomics studies. Here, we present the second version of the database, ResFinderFG v2.0, which is available on the Center of Genomic Epidemiology web server (https://cge.food.dtu.dk/services/ResFinderFG/). It comprises 3913 ARGs identified by functional metagenomics from 50 carefully curated datasets. We assessed its potential to detect ARGs in comparison to other popular databases in gut, soil and water (marine + freshwater) Global Microbial Gene Catalogues (https://gmgc.embl.de). ResFinderFG v2.0 allowed for the detection of ARGs that were not detected using other databases. These included ARGs conferring resistance to beta-lactams, cycline, phenicol, glycopeptide/cycloserine and trimethoprim/sulfonamide. Thus, ResFinderFG v2.0 can be used to identify ARGs differing from those found in conventional databases and therefore improve the description of resistomes.

## Achieving pan-microbiome biological insights via the dbBact knowledge base.
 16.06.2023, _A Amir, E Ozel, Y Haberman, N Shental_


16S rRNA amplicon sequencing provides a relatively inexpensive culture-independent method for studying microbial communities. Although thousands of such studies have examined diverse habitats, it is difficult for researchers to use this vast trove of experiments when interpreting their own findings in a broader context. To bridge this gap, we introduce dbBact - a novel pan-microbiome resource. dbBact combines manually curated information from studies across diverse habitats, creating a collaborative central repository of 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which are assigned multiple ontology-based terms. To date dbBact contains information from more than 1000 studies, which include 1500000 associations between 360000 ASVs and 6500 ontology terms. Importantly, dbBact offers a set of computational tools allowing users to easily query their own datasets against the database. To demonstrate how dbBact augments standard microbiome analysis we selected 16 published papers, and reanalyzed their data via dbBact. We uncovered novel inter-host similarities, potential intra-host sources of bacteria, commonalities across different diseases and lower host-specificity in disease-associated bacteria. We also demonstrate the ability to detect environmental sources, reagent-borne contaminants, and identify potential cross-sample contaminations. These analyses demonstrate how combining information across multiple studies and over diverse habitats leads to better understanding of underlying biological processes.

## Recovery of platinum group metal resources from high-level radioactive liquid wastes by non-contact photoreduction.
 18.06.2023, _H Weng, Y Wang, F Li, Y Muroya, S Yamashita, S Cheng_


Recovery of platinum group metals (PGMs) including palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), and ruthenium (Ru) from high-level radioactive liquid waste (HLLW) possesses enormous environmental and economic benefits. A non-contact photoreduction method was herein developed to selectively recover each PGM from HLLW. Soluble Pd(II), Rh(III), and Ru(III) ions were reduced to insoluble zero-valent metals and separated from simulated HLLW containing neodymium (Nd) as a representative for lanthanides, another main component in HLLW. Detailed investigation on the photoreduction of different PGMs revealed that Pd(II) could be reduced under 254- or 300-nm UV exposure using either ethanol or isopropanol as reductants. Only 300-nm UV light enabled the reduction of Rh(III) in the presence of ethanol or isopropanol. Ru(III) was the most difficult to reduce, which was only realized by 300-nm UV illumination in isopropanol solution. The effects of pH was also studied, suggesting that lower pH favored the separation of Rh(III) but hindered the reduction of Pd(II) and Ru(III). A delicate three-step process was accordingly designed to achieve the selective recovery of each PGM from simulated HLLW. Pd(II) was reduced by 254-nm UV light with the help of ethanol in the first step. Then Rh(III) was reduced by 300-UV light in the second step after the pH was adjusted to 0.5 to suppress the Ru(III) reduction. In the third step, Ru(III) was reduced by 300-nm UV light after isopropanol was added and the pH was adjusted to 3.2. The separation ratios of Pd, Rh, and Ru exceeded 99.8%, 99.9%, and 90.0%, respectively. Meanwhile, all Nd(III) still remained in the simulated HLLW. The separation coefficients between Pd/Rh and Rh/Ru exceeded 56,000 and 75,000, respectively. This work may provide an alternative method to recover PGMs from HLLW, which minimize the secondary radioactive wastes compared with other approaches.
