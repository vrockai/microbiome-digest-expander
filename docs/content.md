Human genetic variation associates with the composition of the gut microbiome, yet its influence on clinical traits remains largely unknown. We analyzed the consequences of nearly a thousand gut microbiome-associated variants (MAVs) on phenotypes reported in electronic health records from tens of thousands of individuals. We discovered and replicated associations of MAVs with neurological, metabolic, digestive, and circulatory diseases. Five significant MAVs in these categories correlate with the relative abundance of microbes down to the strain level. We also demonstrate that these relationships are independently observed and concordant with microbe by disease associations reported in case-control studies. Moreover, a selective sweep and population differentiation impacted some disease-linked MAVs. Combined, these findings establish triad relationships among the human genome, microbiome, and disease. Consequently, human genetic influences may offer opportunities for precision diagnostics of microbiome-associated diseases but also highlight the relevance of genetic background for microbiome modulation and therapeutics.

With the rapid accumulation of microbiome-wide association studies, a great amount of microbiome data are available to study the microbiome's role in human disease and advance the microbiome's potential use for disease prediction. However, the unique features of microbiome data hinder its utility for disease prediction.
