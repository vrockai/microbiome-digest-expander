## Early-life factors contributing to type 1 diabetes.
 09.03.2020, _ME Craig, KW Kim, SR Isaacs, MA Penno, EE Hamilton-Williams, JJ Couper, WD Rawlinson_


The incidence of type 1 diabetes has increased since the mid-twentieth century at a rate that is too rapid to be attributed to genetic predisposition alone. While the disease can occur at any age, mounting evidence from longitudinal cohort studies of at-risk children indicate that type 1 diabetes associated autoantibodies can be present from the first year of life, and that those who develop type 1 diabetes at a young age have a more aggressive form of the disease. This corroborates the hypothesis that environmental exposures in early life contribute to type 1 diabetes risk, whether related to maternal influences on the fetus during pregnancy, neonatal factors or later effects during infancy and early childhood. Studies to date show a range of environmental triggers acting at different time points, suggesting a multifactorial model of genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, which integrally involves a dialogue between the immune system and pancreatic beta cells. For example, breastfeeding may have a weak protective effect on type 1 diabetes risk, while use of an extensively hydrolysed formula does not. Additionally, exposure to being overweight pre-conception, both in utero and postnatally, is associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes. Epidemiological, clinical and pathological studies in humans support a role for viral infections, particularly enteroviruses, in type 1 diabetes, but definitive proof is lacking. The role of the early microbiome and its perturbations in islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes is the subject of investigation in ongoing cohort studies. Understanding the interactions between environmental exposures and the human genome and metagenome, particularly across ethnically diverse populations, will be critical for the development of future strategies for primary prevention of type 1 diabetes.

## Pooled CRISPRi screening of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 for enhanced industrial phenotypes.
 07.04.2020, _L Yao, K Shabestary, SM Bj√∂rk, J Asplund-Samuelsson, HN Joensson, M Jahn, EP Hudson_


Cyanobacteria are model organisms for photosynthesis and are attractive for biotechnology applications. To aid investigation of genotype-phenotype relationships in cyanobacteria, we develop an inducible CRISPRi gene repression library in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, where we aim to target all genes for repression. We track the growth of all library members in multiple conditions and estimate gene fitness. The library reveals several clones with increased growth rates, and these have a common upregulation of genes related to cyclic electron flow. We challenge the library with 0.1 M L-lactate and find that repression of peroxiredoxin bcp2 increases growth rate by 49%. Transforming the library into an L-lactate-secreting Synechocystis strain and sorting top lactate producers enriches clones with sgRNAs targeting nutrient assimilation, central carbon metabolism, and cyclic electron flow. In many examples, productivity can be enhanced by repression of essential genes, which are difficult to access by transposon insertion.

## Gut microbiota and nutrient interactions with skin in psoriasis: A comprehensive review of animal and human studies.
 07.04.2020, _G Damiani, NL Bragazzi, TS McCormick, PDM Pigatto, S Leone, A Pacifico, D Tiodorovic, S Di Franco, A Alfieri, M Fiore_


The intestinal tract (i.e., the gut), is where the body's nutrients are absorbed, and is simultaneously inhabited by numerous microbes. An increasing body of literature suggests a crucial role for the gut microbiome in modulating systemic inflammatory disease. Psoriasis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease and its pathogenesis is related to the interaction between genetic susceptibility, immune response and environmental triggers. The omics era has allowed physicians to assess different aspects of psoriasis pathogenesis such as the microbiome, infectome, and autoinfectome. Furthermore, diet appears to play an important role in modulating disease activity, perhaps by influencing gut microbes. Given these observations, we aimed to summarize the current knowledge regarding skin-microbiome-gut-nutrients and psoriasis.

## Aging and the Combined effects of ADRA2B and CB1 deletions on Affective Working Memory.
 23.03.2020, _B Fairfield, N Mammarella, L Fontanella, A Sarra, M D'Aurora, L Stuppia, V Gatta_


Many studies have found that memory for affective material is better than memory for neutral information and memory for positive material compared to negative material is better in older adults. Behavioral, neurophysiological as well as single polymorphism differences have been advanced to account for these effects. Here, we aimed to examine whether the combination of two polymorphisms (ADRA2B and CB1) in older adults influences active maintenance and manipulation of emotional information in aging working memory. We examined genotype data from 207 older adults (56 double deletion carriers, 116 single deletion carriers and 35 no deletion carriers) who performed a verbal operation span-like task with positive, negative and neutral words. We found that subjects carrying both ADRA2B and CB1 variants generally remembered a higher number of words. In addition, double carriers showed positivity effects while single carriers showed more general emotional enhancement effects, especially as strings lengthened. These findings are amongst the first to suggest a haplotype account of positivity effects in older adults' memory.
