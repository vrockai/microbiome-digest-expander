## Interventions for treating cavitated or dentine carious lesions.
 19.07.2021, _F Schwendicke, T Walsh, T Lamont, W Al-Yaseen, L Bjørndal, JE Clarkson, M Fontana, J Gomez Rossi, G Göstemeyer, C Levey, A Müller, D Ricketts, M Robertson, RM Santamaria, NP Innes_


Traditionally, cavitated carious lesions and those extending into dentine have been treated by 'complete' removal of carious tissue, i.e. non-selective removal and conventional restoration (CR). Alternative strategies for managing cavitated or dentine carious lesions remove less or none of the carious tissue and include selective carious tissue removal (or selective excavation (SE)), stepwise carious tissue removal (SW), sealing carious lesions using sealant materials, sealing using preformed metal crowns (Hall Technique, HT), and non-restorative cavity control (NRCC).

## Differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome based on metagenomic analysis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
 19.07.2021, _H Fan, X Hong, J Zeng, X Wang, J Chen_


_Acupuncture Therapy, Clomiphene, Female, Humans, Menstruation, Obesity, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic_
Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common cause of infertility and shows a high incidence in women of reproductive age. Acupuncture is an appropriate adjunctive treatment for PCOS. However, the add-on effect of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for obese women with PCOS has not been studied, and previous studies indicate that there are individual differences in the curative effect of acupuncture, while deeper research on the mechanism of differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS is still lacking. This trial aims to assess the add-on treatment efficacy of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS and to explore the role of the gut microbiome on the differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture based on metagenomic analysis.

Although recent studies have indicated that intestinal microbiota dweller are involved in the pathogenesis of allergy rhinitis (AR), the influence of gut microbiota on AR adult has not been fully elucidated yet. Hence, we carried out this study to uncover the distinctive bacterial taxa that differentiate allergy rhinitis patients from healthy individuals. Feces samples from thirty three AR patients and thirty one healthy individuals were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

## Holding 'new recovery' together: Organising relations and forms of coordination in professional sociomaterial practices of addiction recovery.
 19.07.2021, _R Fomiatti, D Moore, S Fraser, A Farrugia_


Questions about what addiction recovery is and the mechanisms by which people 'recover' have long animated alcohol and other drug research and policy. These debates became even more intense following the advent, and increasing influence in some quarters, of the 'new recovery'. Starting from the position that recovery is ontologically multiple (Mol &amp; Law, 2002), we trace how alcohol and other drug professionals attempted to make sense of 'new recovery' as a concept and set of professional practices during a period of Australian drug treatment system reform. Drawing on Annemarie Mol's (2002) account of organising relations and forms of coordination (addition, translation and distribution), we explore how the new recovery was enacted and coordinated in alcohol and other drug professionals' sociomaterial practices, and highlight the ontological work involved in holding such an unstable object together. First, we argue that the addition of multiple enactments of addiction and recovery contributed to the formation of a singular and serviceable problem (that was simultaneously heterogeneous and complex), making the 'disease-to-be-treated' amenable to diverse treatment approaches, including new recovery. Second, we analyse the role of metaphor in translating authoritative logics and obligations into an enactment of new recovery suitable for application in clinical settings. Lastly, we track how incompatible enactments of recovery, both new and old, were kept apart through distribution. Although new recovery ultimately failed to gain policy traction in the Australian context, we focus on the ontological work undertaken by professionals in response to its introduction as such case studies can be useful for analysing other powerfully governing policy objects and their operations.

## Role of Gut Microbiota in the Pathophysiology of Stress-Related Disorders: Evidence from Neuroimaging Studies.
 19.07.2021, _S Izuno, K Yoshihara, N Sudo_


The brain and gut communicate bidirectionally via immune, neurological, and endocrine pathways, which is termed the "brain-gut interaction." Recent studies of gut microbiota as a mediator of this interaction have provided a growing body of scientific evidence that suggests that the gut microbiota influences stress and emotional responses and stress-related disorders.

## ANCA-Associated Vasculitis Following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
 19.07.2021, _MT Shakoor, MP Birkenbach, M Lynch_


SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread around the world. As of June 28th 2021, there are approximately 181 million confirmed cases and more than 3.9 million deaths across the globe. The colossal impact of COVID19 is driving the biggest vaccination campaign in human history. All three vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and J&amp;J) authorized for emergency use by FDA have been thoroughly studied and found to be safe and effective in preventing severe COVID-19 cases. While short-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccine resemble those of other vaccines, long-term side effects remain unknown. Rare side effects continue to surface as millions of people receive COVID19 vaccines around the world as compared with the thousands enrolled in the clinical trials. We report a case of new onset renal limited ANCA-associated (AAV) vasculitis in a 78 year old woman with previously normal kidney function after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The patient developed AKI with proteinuria and microscopic hematuria with many dysmorphic red blood cells in the urine. Anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody titer was elevated. Kidney biopsy showed pauci-immune crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis. Kidney function improved after treatment with steroids and rituximab. Our patient had normal routine lab work before the vaccination. Although this case cannot demonstrate a causal relationship between COVID19 vaccination and AAV, ongoing surveillance for similar complications would be prudent as worldwide vaccination efforts continue.

## Identification of pathogen(s) in infectious diseases using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and conventional culture: a comparative study.
 13.07.2021, _H Chen, J Li, S Yan, H Sun, C Tan, M Liu, K Liu, H Zhang, M Zou, X Xiao_


Early and accurate diagnosis of microorganism(s) is important to optimize antimicrobial therapy. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing technology, an unbiased and comprehensive method for pathogen identification, seems to potentially assist or even replace conventional microbiological methodology in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. However, evidence in clinical application of this platform is relatively limited.

## Predicting antibiotic resistance gene abundance in activated sludge using shotgun metagenomics and machine learning.
 19.07.2021, _Y Sun, B Clarke, J Clarke, X Li_


While the microbiome of activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) plays a vital role in shaping the resistome, identifying the potential bacterial hosts of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in WWTPs remains challenging. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using a machine learning approach, random forests (RF's), to identify the strength of associations between ARGs and bacterial taxa in metagenomic datasets from the activated sludge of WWTPs. Our results show that the abundance of select ARGs can be predicted by RF's using abundant genera (Candidatus Accumulibacter, Dechloromonas, Pesudomonas, and Thauera, etc.), (opportunistic) pathogens and indicators (Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Streptococcus, etc.), and nitrifiers (Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira, etc.) as explanatory variables. The correlations between predicted and observed abundance of ARGs (erm(B), tet(O), tet(Q), etc.) ranged from medium (0.400 &lt; R2 &lt; 0.600) to strong (R2 &gt; 0.600) when validated on testing datasets. Compared to those belonging to the other two groups, individual genera in the group of (opportunistic) pathogens and indicator bacteria had more positive functional relationships with select ARGs, suggesting genera in this group (e.g., Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Streptococcus) may be hosts of select ARGs. Furthermore, RF's with (opportunistic) pathogens and indicators as explanatory variables were used to predict the abundance of select ARGs in a full-scale WWTP successfully. Machine learning approaches such as RF's can potentially identify bacterial hosts of ARGs and reveal possible functional relationships between the ARGs and microbial community in the AS of WWTPs.

## Assessing the relationship between the rumen microbiota and feed efficiency in Nellore steers.
 18.07.2021, _DRG Lopes, M de Souza Duarte, AJ La Reau, IZ Chaves, TA de Oliveira Mendes, E Detmann, CBP Bento, MEZ Mercadante, SFM Bonilha, G Suen, HC Mantovani_


Ruminants rely upon a complex community of microbes in their rumen to convert host-indigestible feed into nutrients. However, little is known about the association between the rumen microbiota and feed efficiency traits in Nellore (Bos indicus) cattle, a breed of major economic importance to the global beef market. Here, we compare the composition of the bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the rumen of Nellore steers with high and low feed efficiency (FE) phenotypes, as measured by residual feed intake (RFI).

Computational methods are key in microbiome research, and obtaining a quantitative and unbiased performance estimate is important for method developers and applied researchers. For meaningful comparisons between methods, to identify best practices and common use cases, and to reduce overhead in benchmarking, it is necessary to have standardized datasets, procedures and metrics for evaluation. In this tutorial, we describe emerging standards in computational meta-omics benchmarking derived and agreed upon by a larger community of researchers. Specifically, we outline recent efforts by the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) initiative, which supplies method developers and applied researchers with exhaustive quantitative data about software performance in realistic scenarios and organizes community-driven benchmarking challenges. We explain the most relevant evaluation metrics for assessing metagenome assembly, binning and profiling results, and provide step-by-step instructions on how to generate them. The instructions use simulated mouse gut metagenome data released in preparation for the second round of CAMI challenges and showcase the use of a repository of tool results for CAMI datasets. This tutorial will serve as a reference for the community and facilitate informative and reproducible benchmarking in microbiome research.

The ocean microbiota modulates global biogeochemical cycles and changes in its configuration may have large-scale consequences. Yet, the underlying ecological mechanisms structuring it are unclear. Here, we investigate how fundamental ecological mechanisms (selection, dispersal and ecological drift) shape the smallest members of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota: prokaryotes and minute eukaryotes (picoeukaryotes). Furthermore, we investigate the agents exerting abiotic selection on this assemblage as well as the spatial patterns emerging from the action of ecological mechanisms. To explore this, we analysed the composition of surface-ocean prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities using DNA-sequence data (16S- and 18S-rRNA genes) collected during the circumglobal expeditions Malaspina-2010 and TARA-Oceans.
