## Identification of antimicrobial peptides from the human gut microbiome using deep learning.
 04.03.2022, _Y Ma, Z Guo, B Xia, Y Zhang, X Liu, Y Yu, N Tang, X Tong, M Wang, X Ye, J Feng, Y Chen, J Wang_


The human gut microbiome encodes a large variety of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), but the short lengths of AMPs pose a challenge for computational prediction. Here we combined multiple natural language processing neural network models, including LSTM, Attention and BERT, to form a unified pipeline for candidate AMP identification from human gut microbiome data. Of 2,349 sequences identified as candidate AMPs, 216 were chemically synthesized, with 181 showing antimicrobial activity (a positive rate of &gt;83%). Most of these peptides have less than 40% sequence homology to AMPs in the training set. Further characterization of the 11 most potent AMPs showed high efficacy against antibiotic-resistant, Gram-negative pathogens and demonstrated significant efficacy in lowering bacterial load by more than tenfold against a mouse model of bacterial lung infection. Our study showcases the potential of machine learning approaches for mining functional peptides from metagenome data and accelerating the discovery of promising AMP candidate molecules for in-depth investigations.

## Microbiome risk profiles as biomarkers for inflammatory and metabolic disorders.
 22.02.2022, _A Metwaly, S Reitmeier, D Haller_


The intestine harbours a complex array of microorganisms collectively known as the gut microbiota. The past two decades have witnessed increasing interest in studying the gut microbiota in health and disease, largely driven by rapid innovation in high-throughput multi-omics technologies. As a result, microbial dysbiosis has been linked to many human pathologies, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and inflammatory bowel disease. Integrated analyses of multi-omics data, including metagenomics and metabolomics along with measurements of host response and cataloguing of bacterial isolates, have identified many bacteria and bacterial products that are correlated with disease. Nevertheless, insight into the mechanisms through which microbes affect intestinal health requires going beyond correlation to causation. Current understanding of the contribution of the gut microbiota to disease causality remains limited, largely owing to the heterogeneity of microbial community structures, interindividual differences in disease evolution and incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that integrate microbiota-derived signals into host signalling pathways. In this Review, we provide a broad insight into the microbiome signatures linked to inflammatory and metabolic disorders, discuss outstanding challenges in this field and propose applications of multi-omics technologies that could lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of microorganism-host interactions.

## Systematically assessing microbiome-disease associations identifies drivers of inconsistency in metagenomic research.
 05.03.2022, _BT Tierney, Y Tan, Z Yang, B Shui, MJ Walker, BM Kent, AD Kostic, CJ Patel_


Evaluating the relationship between the human gut microbiome and disease requires computing reliable statistical associations. Here, using millions of different association modeling strategies, we evaluated the consistency-or robustness-of microbiome-based disease indicators for 6 prevalent and well-studied phenotypes (across 15 public cohorts and 2,343 individuals). We were able to discriminate between analytically robust versus nonrobust results. In many cases, different models yielded contradictory associations for the same taxon-disease pairing, some showing positive correlations and others negative. When querying a subset of 581 microbe-disease associations that have been previously reported in the literature, 1 out of 3 taxa demonstrated substantial inconsistency in association sign. Notably, &gt;90% of published findings for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were particularly nonrobust in this regard. We additionally quantified how potential confounders-sequencing depth, glucose levels, cholesterol, and body mass index, for example-influenced associations, analyzing how these variables affect the ostensible correlation between Faecalibacterium prausnitzii abundance and a healthy gut. Overall, we propose our approach as a method to maximize confidence when prioritizing findings that emerge from microbiome association studies.

## HiCBin: binning metagenomic contigs and recovering metagenome-assembled genomes using Hi-C contact maps.
 01.03.2022, _Y Du, F Sun_


Recovering high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from complex microbial ecosystems remains challenging. Recently, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) has been applied to simultaneously study multiple genomes in natural microbial communities. We develop HiCBin, a novel open-source pipeline, to resolve high-quality MAGs utilizing Hi-C contact maps. HiCBin employs the HiCzin normalization method and the Leiden clustering algorithm and includes the spurious contact detection into binning pipelines for the first time. HiCBin is validated on one synthetic and two real metagenomic samples and is shown to outperform the existing Hi-C-based binning methods. HiCBin is available at https://github.com/dyxstat/HiCBin .

## No association in maternal serum levels of TMAO and its precursors in pre-eclampsia and in non-complicated pregnancies.
 05.03.2022, _T Jääskeläinen, O Kärkkäinen, S Heinonen, K Hanhineva, H Laivuori_


Only a few studies have explored the role of microbiota-dependent metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in non-complicated pregnancy and in pre-eclampsia (PE). We enrolled 139 PE and 29 healthy pregnant women in a nested case control study. We hypothesized that elevated levels of circulating TMAO and its precursors choline and glycine betaine in the late second or in third trimester might contribute to the PE and are associated with the onset of the disease and clinical features such as elevated blood pressure. The association with a few available lifestyle factors (use of fish and physical activity) was also evaluated. In contrast with the previous findings, there was no difference in TMAO concentration between PE and healthy women. In addition, TMAO concentration was not associated with any of the PE related clinical features, angiogenic or inflammatory markers. In future, it is crucial to obtain longitudinal data on TMAO in both non-complicated and in PE pregnancies before we could have more detailed understanding of TMAO.

## Mechanism of Dyspnea during Exercise in Children with Corrected Congenital Heart Disease.
 24.01.2022, _M Chlif, MM Ammar, NB Said, L Sergey, S Ahmaidi, F Alassery, H Hamam_


_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## The impact of wait time on patient outcomes in knee and hip replacement surgery: a scoping review protocol.
 05.03.2022, _E Dawson, ME Neufeld, E Schemitsch, A John-Baptiste_


Total hip and total knee replacement surgery are in high demand, leading to long wait times for many patients. While on the waiting list, patients may experience worsening pain, reduced mobility, and deteriorating health. Given that long wait times are common for lower joint replacement surgery, it is important to understand how patient health changes during the wait period and whether this impacts patient outcomes after surgery. The aim of this scoping review will be to identify and describe the evidence regarding the impact of wait time on patient outcomes for patients who undergo total knee and total hip replacement surgery.

## A review of ethical and legal aspects of gender-neutral human papillomavirus vaccination.
 05.03.2022, _M Logel, C Laurie, M El-Zein, J Guichon, EL Franco_


While launching a campaign to eliminate cervical cancer, the World Health Organization called to halt human papillomavirus (HPV) gender-neutral vaccination (GNV) because of limited vaccine supply, raising ethical and legal questions about female-only vaccination versus GNV. We identified ethical and legal aspects of HPV GNV by searching MEDLINE for records up to February 19, 2021. We also provided an overview of HPV vaccines, the evolution of HPV vaccine recommendations in North America, and a timeline of male HPV vaccination introduction by searching PubMed, Google, and government websites. Four HPV vaccines are available: Cervarix®, Gardasil®, Gardasil®9, and Cecolin®. Vaccine recommendations in North America evolved from female only to eventually include males. Following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the first HPV vaccine for males (2009), 35 countries began vaccinating males (2011-2020). Based on 56 eligible records out of 652, we identified the following constructs: lower male awareness of HPV and vaccination (n=13), limited economic resources (n=5), shared social responsibility (n=18), unprotected groups from female-only HPV vaccination (n=10), limited screening for HPV-associated noncervical cancers (n=6), consideration of ethical principles (n=17), and HPV vaccine mandates (n=5). Ethical and legal aspects must be considered when recommending vaccination for females only or GNV.
