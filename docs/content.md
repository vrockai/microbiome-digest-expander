Currently, over half of breast cancer cases are unrelated to known risk factors, highlighting the importance of discovering other cancer-promoting factors. Since crosstalk between gut microbes and host immunity contributes to many diseases, we hypothesized that similar interactions could occur between the recently described breast microbiome and local immune responses to influence breast cancer pathogenesis.

## Microbiome-immune interactions in tuberculosis.
 15.04.2021, _G Mori, M Morrison, A Blumenthal_


Tuberculosis (TB) remains an infectious disease of global significance and a leading cause of death in low- and middle-income countries. Significant effort has been directed towards understanding Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomics, virulence, and pathophysiology within the framework of Koch postulates. More recently, the advent of "-omics" approaches has broadened our appreciation of how "commensal" microbes have coevolved with their host and have a central role in shaping health and susceptibility to disease. It is now clear that there is a diverse repertoire of interactions between the microbiota and host immune responses that can either sustain or disrupt homeostasis. In the context of the global efforts to combatting TB, such findings and knowledge have raised important questions: Does microbiome composition indicate or determine susceptibility or resistance to M. tuberculosis infection? Is the development of active disease or latent infection upon M. tuberculosis exposure influenced by the microbiome? Does microbiome composition influence TB therapy outcome and risk of reinfection with M. tuberculosis? Can the microbiome be actively managed to reduce risk of M. tuberculosis infection or recurrence of TB? Here, we explore these questions with a particular focus on microbiome-immune interactions that may affect TB susceptibility, manifestation and progression, the long-term implications of anti-TB therapy, as well as the potential of the host microbiome as target for clinical manipulation.

## The aging gut microbiome and its impact on host immunity.
 22.04.2021, _N Bosco, M Noti_


The microbiome plays a fundamental role in the maturation, function, and regulation of the host-immune system from birth to old age. In return, the immune system has co-evolved a mutualistic relationship with trillions of beneficial microbes residing our bodies while mounting efficient responses to fight invading pathogens. As we age, both the immune system and the gut microbiome undergo significant changes in composition and function that correlate with increased susceptibility to infectious diseases and reduced vaccination responses. Emerging studies suggest that targeting age-related dysbiosis can improve health- and lifespan, in part through reducing systemic low-grade inflammation and immunosenescence-two hallmarks of the aging process. However-a cause and effect relationship of age-related dysbiosis and associated functional declines in immune cell functioning have yet to be demonstrated in clinical settings. This review aims to (i) give an overview on hallmarks of the aging immune system and gut microbiome, (ii) discuss the impact of age-related changes in the gut commensal community structure (introduced as microb-aging) on host-immune fitness and health, and (iii) summarize prebiotic- and probiotic clinical intervention trials aiming to reinforce age-related declines in immune cell functioning through microbiome modulation or rejuvenation.
