## Colonic Transendoscopic Enteral Tubing Is a New Pathway to Microbial Therapy, Colonic Drainage, and Host-Microbiota Interaction Research.
 11.02.2023, _W Wang, G Lu, X Wu, Q Wen, F Zhang_


The limitation of traditional delivery methods for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) gave birth to colonic transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET) to address the requirement of frequent FMTs. Colonic TET as a novel endoscopic intervention has received increasing attention in practice since 2015 in China. Emerging studies from multiple centers indicate that colonic TET is a promising, safe, and practical delivery method for microbial therapy and administering medication with high patient satisfaction. Intriguingly, colonic TET has been used to rescue endoscopy-related perforations by draining colonic air and fluid through the TET tube. Recent research based on collecting ileocecal samples through a TET tube has contributed to demonstrating community dynamics in the intestine, and it is expected to be a novel delivery of proof-of-concept in host-microbiota interactions and pharmacological research. The present article aims to review the concept and techniques of TET and to explore microbial therapy, colonic drainage, and microbial research based on colonic TET.

## GTDB-Tk v2: memory friendly classification with the genome taxonomy database.
 23.12.2022, _PA Chaumeil, AJ Mussig, P Hugenholtz, DH Parks_


_Documentation, Software_
The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) and associated taxonomic classification toolkit (GTDB-Tk) have been widely adopted by the microbiology community. However, the growing size of the GTDB bacterial reference tree has resulted in GTDB-Tk requiring substantial amounts of memory (∼320 GB) which limits its adoption and ease of use. Here, we present an update to GTDB-Tk that uses a divide-and-conquer approach where user genomes are initially placed into a bacterial reference tree with family-level representatives followed by placement into an appropriate class-level subtree comprising species representatives. This substantially reduces the memory requirements of GTDB-Tk while having minimal impact on classification.

## Umbrella review: Summary of findings for acupuncture as treatment for radiation-induced xerostomia.
 13.02.2023, _J Dörfler, M Freuding, C Zaiser, J Büntzel, C Keinki, L Käsmann, J Hübner_


Acupuncture is a common part of complementary medicine. However, traditional Chinese acupuncture has been built on concepts which are not in accordance with science-based medicine. Our aim was to critically assess the evidence presented in systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) about the effectiveness of acupuncture on radiotherapy induced xerostomia. A systematic search was conducted in February 2022. We evaluated all SRs/MAs using the AMSTAR-2 instrument. Eight SRs, with 12 controlled studies were included. All SRs summarize that the methodological drawbacks do not allow to give a clear statement about the effectiveness of acupuncture. While objective assessments in most SRs/MAs reported no difference between real and sham acupuncture, some favorable effects on subjective xerostomia symptoms are found. No clinical meaningful effectiveness of acupuncture on xerostomia has been proven so far, but positive subjective findings need to be explored more. While most SRs recommend further studies, studies involving patients with a serious cancer diagnosis are ethically questionable.

Mental health concerns of university students are gaining more attention since the emergence of the coronavirus disease. Consequently, scholars in education, health and psychology-related fields have attributed the dwindling subjective well-being (SWB) of students to their low levels of digital health literacy (DHL). However, little attention has been paid to an important variable like pocket money (PM) which might serve as a buffer against reduced levels of SWB. In this study, we explored the dynamics of PM and its linkage with DHL and SWB among university students in Ghana.

## Nanomaterials to address the genesis of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli.
 31.01.2023, _M Kaushik, N Sarkar, A Singh, P Kumar_

Escherichia is a genus of prokaryotic gram-negative bacteria which forms a vital component of the gut microbiota of homeotherms including humans. Many members of this genus are commensals and pathogenic strains, which are responsible for some of the most common bacterial infections and can be fatal, particularly in the case of newborns and children. The fecal matter in wastewater treatment plants serves as major environmental sinks for the accumulation of Escherichia. The rise in antibiotic pollution and the lateral gene exchange of antibiotic-resistant genes have created antibiotic-resistant Escherichia strains that are often called superbugs. Antibiotic resistance has reached a crisis level that nowadays existing antibiotics are no longer effective. One way of tackling this emerging concern is by using nanomaterials. Punitively, nanomaterials can be used by conjugating with antibodies, biomolecules, and peptides to reduce antibiotic usage, whereas, preventatively, they can be used as either nano-antimicrobial additives or nano-photocatalytic sheets to reduce the microbial population and target the superbugs of environmental Escherichia. In this review, we have explored the threat posed by pathogenic Escherichia strains in the environment, especially in the context of antibiotic-resistant strains. Along with this, we have discussed some nanomaterial-mediated strategies in which the problem can be addressed by using nanomaterials as nanophotocatalytics, antimicrobial additives, drugs, and drug conjugates. This review also presents a brief overview of the ecological threats posed by the overuse of nanomaterials which warrants a balanced and judicious approach to the problem.

The composition and metabolism of the human gut microbiota are strongly influenced by dietary complex glycans, which cause downstream effects on the physiology and health of hosts. Despite recent advances in our understanding of glycan metabolism by human gut bacteria, we still need methods to link glycans to their consuming bacteria. Here, we use a functional assay to identify and isolate gut bacteria from healthy human volunteers that take up different glycans. The method combines metabolic labeling using fluorescent oligosaccharides with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), followed by amplicon sequencing or culturomics. Our results demonstrate metabolic labeling in various taxa, such as Prevotella copri, Collinsella aerofaciens and Blautia wexlerae. In vitro validation confirms the ability of most, but not all, labeled species to consume the glycan of interest for growth. In parallel, we show that glycan consumers spanning three major phyla can be isolated from cultures of sorted labeled cells. By linking bacteria to the glycans they consume, this approach increases our basic understanding of glycan metabolism by gut bacteria. Going forward, it could be used to provide insight into the mechanism of prebiotic approaches, where glycans are used to manipulate the gut microbiota composition.

## Disturbance of lipid metabolism in germ-free mice transplanted with gut microbiota of DSS-induced colitis mice.

Hepatobiliary abnormality and metabolic disorders are frequently observed complications in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Given that microbiota dysbiosis is a common pathophysiological feature of both IBD and metabolic diseases, we examined how the IBD-induced dysbiosis affects the host metabolism and contributes to the development of associated metabolic diseases using germ-free (GF) mice transplanted with fecal microbiota of DSS-induced colitis mice. There was no significant change in inflammation or barrier integrity in the gut of GF mice that received microbiota from colitis mice compared to their counterparts that were transplanted with microbiota from non-colitis healthy mice. Interestingly, it was observed that the GF recipients of colitis-induced altered microbiota showed a significant decrease in the weight of adipose tissues including mesenteric, epididymal, subcutaneous, and brown fat without any change in body weight, which was accompanied by abnormalities in adipose tissue functions such as fat storage and adiponectin production. Transplantation of colitis-induced altered microbiota also disrupted hepatic lipid metabolism in the GF recipient mice, which was observed by increases in synthesis and accumulation of cholesterol and bile acids in hepatocytes and a decrease in plasma HDL-cholesterol. Additional observations including elevated plasma levels of insulin, decreased hepatic production of FGF21, and decreased levels of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and hepatic expression of SCFA receptors led to a conclusion that the transplantation of the colitis-associated dysbiotic microbiota was causally associated with impairments of insulin action and FGF21-adiponectin axis, possibly due to the low SCFA-producing capacity of the colonized microbiota, leading to metabolic abnormalities including adipose tissue dysfunction and dysregulated hepatic lipid metabolism. Our findings suggest potential mechanisms that explain how colitis-associated gut dysbiosis may contribute to the development of metabolic dysfunctions, which could be applied to clinical practice to improve the efficacy of treatment of IBD patients with comorbid metabolic disorders or vice versa.

## uBin - a manual refining tool for genomes from metagenomes.
 10.02.2023, _TLV Bornemann, SP Esser, TL Stach, T Burg, AJ Probst_


Resolving bacterial and archaeal genomes from metagenomes has revolutionized our understanding of Earth's biomes yet producing high quality genomes from assembled fragments has been an ever-standing problem. While automated binning software and their combination produce prokaryotic bins in high throughput, their manual refinement has been slow, sometimes difficult or missing entirely facilitating error propagation in public databases. Here, we present uBin, a GUI-based, standalone bin refiner that runs on all major operating platforms and was additionally designed for educational purposes. When applied to the public CAMI dataset, refinement of bins using GC content, coverage and taxonomy was able to improve 78.9% of bins by decreasing their contamination. We also applied the bin refiner as a standalone binner to public metagenomes from the International Space Station and demonstrate the recovery of near-complete genomes, whose replication indices indicate active proliferation of microbes in Earth's lower orbit. uBin is an easy to install software for bin refinement, binning of simple metagenomes and communication of metagenomic results to other scientists and in classrooms. The software and its helper scripts are open source and available under https://github.com/ProbstLab/uBin. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

## The virtual microbiome: A computational framework to evaluate microbiome analyses.
 10.02.2023, _B Serrano-Antón, F Rodríguez-Ventura, P Colomer-Vidal, RA Cigliano, CF Arias, F Bertocchini_


_Animals, Reproducibility of Results, Microbiota, Bacteria, Larva, Moths_
Microbiomes have been the focus of a substantial research effort in the last decades. The composition of microbial populations is normally determined by comparing DNA sequences sampled from those populations with the sequences stored in genomic databases. Therefore, the amount of information available in databanks should be expected to constrain the accuracy of microbiome analyses. Albeit normally ignored in microbiome studies, this constraint could severely compromise the reliability of microbiome data. To test this hypothesis, we generated virtual bacterial populations that exhibit the ecological structure of real-world microbiomes. Confronting the analyses of virtual microbiomes with their original composition revealed critical issues in the current approach to characterizing microbiomes, issues that were empirically confirmed by analyzing the microbiome of Galleria mellonella larvae. To reduce the uncertainty of microbiome data, the effort in the field must be channeled towards significantly increasing the amount of available genomic information and optimizing the use of this information.
