Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from the human gut microbiota, and in particular propionate, may beneficially influence metabolic processes such as appetite regulation. Development of prebiotics that induce high propionate levels during fermentation is desirable. Eleven candidate prebiotics were screened to investigate their fermentation characteristics, with a focus on propionate production in mixed anaerobic batch culture of faecal bacteria. Further to this, a continuous 3-stage colonic fermentation model (simulating the human colon) was used to evaluate changes in microbial ecology, lactate and SCFA production of three 50:50 blends, comprising both slow and rapidly fermented prebiotics. In mixed batch culture: xylo-oligosaccharide, polydextrose and α-gluco-oligosaccharide were associated with the greatest increase in propionate. Polydextrose, α-gluco-oligosaccharide, β-1,4 glucan and oat fibre induced the greatest reductions in the acetate to propionate ratio. The most bifidogenic prebiotics were the oligosaccharides. Fermentation of a 50:50 blend of inulin and arabinoxylan, through the continuous 3-stage colonic fermentation model, induced a substantial and sustained release of propionate. The sustained release of propionate through the colon, if replicable in vivo, could potentially influence blood glucose, blood lipids and appetite regulation, however, dietary intervention studies are needed. Bifidogenic effects were also observed for the inulin and arabinoxylan blend and an increase synthesis of butyrate and lactate, thus indicating wider prebiotic potential.

## Time outweighs the effect of host developmental stage on microbial community composition.

Thousands of microbial taxa in the soil form symbioses with host plants, and due to their contribution to plant performance, these microbes are often considered an extension of the host genome. Given microbial effects on host performance, it is important to understand factors that govern microbial community assembly. Host developmental stage could affect rhizosphere microbial diversity while, alternatively, microbial assemblages could change simply as a consequence of time and the opportunity for microbial succession. Previous studies suggest that rhizosphere microbial assemblages shift across plant developmental stages, but time since germination is confounded with developmental stage. We asked how elapsed time and potential microbial succession relative to host development affected microbial diversity in the rhizosphere using monogenic flowering-time mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana. Under our experimental design, different developmental stages were present among host genotypes after the same amount of time following germination, e.g. at 76 days following germination some host genotypes were flowering while others were fruiting or senescing. We found that elapsed time was a strong predictor of microbial diversity whereas there were few differences among developmental stages. Our results support the idea that time and, likely, microbial succession more strongly affect microbial community assembly than host developmental stage.
