The environment plays an instrumental role in the developmental origins of health and disease. Protective features of the environment in the development of asthma and atopy have been insufficiently studied. We used data from the CHILD (Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development) Cohort Study to examine relationships between living near natural green spaces in early infancy in Edmonton, AB, Canada and the development of atopic sensitization at 1 year and 3 years of age in a cohort of 699 infants, and whether these associations were mediated by infant gut microbiota (measured using 16s V4 amplicon sequencing) at 4 months. The Urban Planning Land Vegetation Index (uPLVI) map of the City of Edmonton was used to assess infants' exposure to natural spaces based on their home postal codes, and atopic sensitization was assessed using skin prink testing (SPTs) for common food and inhalant allergens. Our findings suggest there is a protective effect of natural green space proximity on the development of multiple inhalant atopic sensitizations at 3 years (odds ratio = 0.28 [95% CI 0.09, 0.90]). This relationship was mediated by changes to Actinobacteria diversity in infant fecal samples taken at 4 months. We also found a positive association between nature proximity and sensitization to at least one food or inhaled allergen; this association was not mediated by gut microbiota. Together, these findings underscore the importance of promoting natural urban greenspace preservation to improve child health by reducing atopic disease susceptibility. IMPORTANCE Our findings highlight the importance of preserving natural green space in urban settings to prevent sensitization to environmental allergens and promote early-life gut microbiota pathways to this health benefit. These findings support a mediating role of gut microbiome compositions in health and disease susceptibility. This study used unique, accurate, and comprehensive methodology to classify natural space exposure via a high-resolution topographical map of foliage subtypes within the City of Edmonton limits. These methods are improvements from other methods previously used to classify natural space exposure, such as the normalized density vegetation index from satellite imagery, which is not able to distinguish anthropogenic from green space. The use of these methods and the associations found between natural green space exposure and atopic sensitization outcomes support their use in future studies. Our findings also provide many avenues for future research including longer term follow up of this cohort and investigation of a causal role of reduced Actinobacteria diversity on atopic sensitization development.

To better adapt to seasonal environmental changes, physiological processes and behaviors are regulated seasonally. The gut microbiome interacts with the physiology, behavior, and even the diseases of host animals, including humans and livestock. Seasonal changes in gut microbiome composition have been reported in several species under natural environments. Dietary content significantly affects the composition of the microbiome, and, in the natural environment, the diet varies between different seasons. Therefore, understanding the seasonal regulatory mechanisms of the gut microbiome is important for understanding the seasonal adaptation strategies of animals. Herein, we examined the effects of changing day length and temperature, which mimic summer and winter conditions, on the gut microbiome of laboratory mice. Principal coordinate analysis and analysis of the composition of microbiomes of 16S rRNA sequencing data demonstrated that the microbiomes of the cecum and large intestine showed significant differences between summer and winter mimicking conditions. Similar to previous studies, a daily rhythm was observed in the composition of the microbiome. Furthermore, the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states predicted seasonal changes in several metabolic pathways. Changing day length and temperature can affect the composition of the gut microbiome without changing dietary contents.

## Clinical and biological significance of RNA N6-methyladenosine regulators in Alzheimer disease.
 17.02.2023, _Z Qiu, X Bai, X Han, P Wang, X Wang, Y Lv, Y An_


RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulators are essential for a variety of biological functions, such as early development, viral infections, and cancer. However, their roles in Alzheimer disease (AD) are still not very clear. Here, 16 significant m6A regulators were identified using difference analysis between AD patients and non-demented controls based on the GSE132903 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Using these 16 m6A regulators, a nomogram model was established to predict the prevalence of AD. We found that patients could obtain a good clinical benefit based on this model. In addition, we revealed 2 distinct m6A patterns and 2 distinct m6A gene patterns in AD and demonstrated their prognostic and risk assessment significance. This present work comprehensively evaluated the functions of m6A regulators in the diagnosis and subtype classification of AD. These results suggested they have potential prognostic and risk assessment significance in AD.

## Four principles to establish a universal virus taxonomy.

_Humans, Bacteriophages, Metagenomics, Phylogeny, Viruses_
A universal taxonomy of viruses is essential for a comprehensive view of the virus world and for communicating the complicated evolutionary relationships among viruses. However, there are major differences in the conceptualisation and approaches to virus classification and nomenclature among virologists, clinicians, agronomists, and other interested parties. Here, we provide recommendations to guide the construction of a coherent and comprehensive virus taxonomy, based on expert scientific consensus. Firstly, assignments of viruses should be congruent with the best attainable reconstruction of their evolutionary histories, i.e., taxa should be monophyletic. This fundamental principle for classification of viruses is currently included in the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) code only for the rank of species. Secondly, phenotypic and ecological properties of viruses may inform, but not override, evolutionary relatedness in the placement of ranks. Thirdly, alternative classifications that consider phenotypic attributes, such as being vector-borne (e.g., "arboviruses"), infecting a certain type of host (e.g., "mycoviruses," "bacteriophages") or displaying specific pathogenicity (e.g., "human immunodeficiency viruses"), may serve important clinical and regulatory purposes but often create polyphyletic categories that do not reflect evolutionary relationships. Nevertheless, such classifications ought to be maintained if they serve the needs of specific communities or play a practical clinical or regulatory role. However, they should not be considered or called taxonomies. Finally, while an evolution-based framework enables viruses discovered by metagenomics to be incorporated into the ICTV taxonomy, there are essential requirements for quality control of the sequence data used for these assignments. Combined, these four principles will enable future development and expansion of virus taxonomy as the true evolutionary diversity of viruses becomes apparent.
