Microbial-based therapeutics in clinical practice are of considerable interest, and a recent study demonstrated fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) followed by dietary fiber supplements improved glucose homeostasis. Previous evidence suggests that donor and recipient compatibility and FMT protocol are key determinants, but little is known about the involvement of specific recipient factors. Using data from our recent randomized placebo-control phase 2 clinical trial in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome, we grouped participants that received FMT from one of 4 donors with either fiber supplement into HOMA-IR responders (n = 21) and HOMA-IR non-responders (n = 8). We further assessed plasma bile acids using targeted metabolomics and performed subgroup analyzes to evaluate the effects of recipient parameters and gastrointestinal factors on microbiota engraftment and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) response. The baseline fecal microbiota composition at genus level of recipients could predict the improvements in HOMA2-IR at week 6 (ROC-AUC = 0.70). Prevotella was identified as an important predictor, with responders having significantly lower relative abundance than non-responders (p = .02). In addition, recipients displayed a highly individualized degree of microbial engraftment from donors. Compared to the non-responders, the responders had significantly increased bacterial richness (Chao1) after FMT and a more consistent engraftment of donor-specific bacteria ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) such as Faecalibacillus intestinalis (ASV44), Roseburia spp. (ASV103), and Christensenellaceae spp. (ASV140) (p &lt; .05). Microbiota engraftment was strongly associated with recipients' factors at baseline including initial gut microbial diversity, fiber and nutrient intakes, inflammatory markers, and bile acid derivative levels. This study identified that responders to FMT therapy had a higher engraftment rate in the transplantation of specific donor-specific microbes, which were strongly correlated with insulin sensitivity improvements. Further, the recipient baseline gut microbiota and related factors were identified as the determinants for responsiveness to FMT and fiber supplementation. The findings provide a basis for the development of precision microbial therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic syndrome.

The etiopathogenesis of diverticulitis, among the most common gastrointestinal diagnoses, remains largely unknown. By leveraging stool collected within a large prospective cohort, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomics profiling among 121 women diagnosed with diverticulitis requiring antibiotics or hospitalizations (cases), matched to 121 women without diverticulitis (controls) according to age and race. Overall microbial community structure and metabolomic profiles differed in diverticulitis cases compared to controls, including enrichment of pro-inflammatory Ruminococcus gnavus, 1,7-dimethyluric acid, and histidine-related metabolites, and depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria and anti-inflammatory ceramides. Through integrated multi-omic analysis, we detected covarying microbial and metabolic features, such as Bilophila wadsworthia and bile acids, specific to diverticulitis. Additionally, we observed that microbial composition modulated the protective association between a prudent fiber-rich diet and diverticulitis. Our findings offer insights into the perturbations in inflammation-related microbial and metabolic signatures associated with diverticulitis, supporting the potential of microbial-based diagnostics and therapeutic targets.

Fluvalinate is widely used in the control of Varroa destructor, but its residues in colonies threaten honeybees. The effect of fluvalinate-induced dysbiosis on honeybee-related gene expression and the gut microenvironment of honeybees has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, two-day-old larvae to seven-day-old adult worker bees were continuously fed different amounts of fluvalinate-sucrose solutions (0, 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg), after which the expression levels of two immune-related genes (Hymenoptaecin and Defensin1) and three detoxication-related genes (GSTS3, CAT, and CYP450) in worker bees (1, 7, and 20 days old) were measured. The effect of fluvalinate on the gut microbes of worker bees at seven days old also was explored using 16S rRNA Illumina deep sequencing. The results showed that exposure of honeybees to the insecticide fluvalinate affected their gene expression and gut microbial composition. As the age of honeybees increased, the effect of fluvalinate on the expression of Hymenoptaecin, CYP450, and CAT decreased, and the abundance of honeybee gut bacteria was affected by increasing the fluvalinate concentration. These findings provide insights into the synergistic defense of honeybee hosts against exogenous stresses in conjunction with honeybee gut microbes.

## Rhizospheric bacteria from the Atacama Desert hyper-arid core: cultured community dynamics and plant growth promotion.
 30.04.2024, _J Castro-Severyn, J Fortt, M Sierralta, P Alegria, G Donoso, A Choque, AM Avellaneda, C Pardo-Esté, CP Saavedra, A Stoll, F Remonsellez_


The Atacama Desert is the oldest and driest desert on Earth, encompassing great temperature variations, high ultraviolet radiation, drought, and high salinity, making it ideal for studying the limits of life and resistance strategies. It is also known for harboring a great biodiversity of adapted life forms. While desertification is increasing as a result of climate change and human activities, it is necessary to optimize soil and water usage, where stress-resistant crops are possible solutions. As many studies have revealed the great impact of the rhizobiome on plant growth efficiency and resistance to abiotic stress, we set up to explore the rhizospheric soils of Suaeda foliosa and Distichlis spicata desert plants. By culturing these soils and using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we address community taxonomy composition dynamics, stability through time, and the ability to promote lettuce plant growth. The rhizospheric soil communities were dominated by the families Pseudomonadaceae, Bacillaceae, and Planococcaceae for S. foliosa and Porphyromonadaceae and Haloferacaceae for D. spicata. Nonetheless, the cultures were completely dominated by the Enterobacteriaceae family (up to 98%). Effectively, lettuce plants supplemented with the cultures showed greater size and biomass accumulation. We identified 12 candidates that could be responsible for these outcomes, of which 5 (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Paenisporosarcina, and Ammoniphilus) were part of the built co-occurrence network. We aim to contribute to the efforts to characterize the microbial communities as key for the plant's survival in extreme environments and as a possible source of consortia with plant growth promotion traits aimed at agricultural applications.IMPORTANCEThe current scenario of climate change and desertification represents a series of incoming challenges for all living organisms. As the human population grows rapidly, so does the rising demand for food and natural resources; thus, it is necessary to make agriculture more efficient by optimizing soil and water usage, thus ensuring future food supplies. Particularly, the Atacama Desert (northern Chile) is considered the most arid place on Earth as a consequence of geological and climatic characteristics, such as the naturally low precipitation patterns and high temperatures, which makes it an ideal place to carry out research that seeks to aid agriculture in future conditions that are predicted to resemble these scenarios. Our main interest lies in utilizing microorganism consortia from plants thriving under extreme conditions, aiming to promote plant growth, improve crops, and render "unsuitable" soils farmable.

Several studies have documented the significant impact of methodological choices in microbiome analyses. The myriad of methodological options available complicate the replication of results and generally limit the comparability of findings between independent studies that use differing techniques and measurement pipelines. Here we describe the Mosaic Standards Challenge (MSC), an international interlaboratory study designed to assess the impact of methodological variables on the results. The MSC did not prescribe methods but rather asked participating labs to analyze 7 shared reference samples (5 × human stool samples and 2 × mock communities) using their standard laboratory methods. To capture the array of methodological variables, each participating lab completed a metadata reporting sheet that included 100 different questions regarding the details of their protocol. The goal of this study was to survey the methodological landscape for microbiome metagenomic sequencing (MGS) analyses and the impact of methodological decisions on metagenomic sequencing results. A total of 44 labs participated in the MSC by submitting results (16S or WGS) along with accompanying metadata; thirty 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets and 14 WGS datasets were collected. The inclusion of two types of reference materials (human stool and mock communities) enabled analysis of both MGS measurement variability between different protocols using the biologically-relevant stool samples, and MGS bias with respect to ground truth values using the DNA mixtures. Owing to the compositional nature of MGS measurements, analyses were conducted on the ratio of Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes allowing us to directly apply common statistical methods. The resulting analysis demonstrated that protocol choices have significant effects, including both bias of the MGS measurement associated with a particular methodological choices, as well as effects on measurement robustness as observed through the spread of results between labs making similar methodological choices. In the analysis of the DNA mock communities, MGS measurement bias was observed even when there was general consensus among the participating laboratories. This study was the result of a collaborative effort that included academic, commercial, and government labs. In addition to highlighting the impact of different methodological decisions on MGS result comparability, this work also provides insights for consideration in future microbiome measurement study design.

The advent of viral metagenomics, or viromics, has improved our knowledge and understanding of global viral diversity. High-throughput sequencing technologies enable explorations of the ecological roles, contributions to host metabolism, and the influence of viruses in various environments, including the human intestinal microbiome. However, bacterial metagenomic studies frequently have the advantage. The adoption of advanced technologies like long-read sequencing has the potential to be transformative in refining viromics and metagenomics. Here, we examined the effectiveness of long-read and hybrid sequencing by comparing Illumina short-read and Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long-read sequencing technologies and different assembly strategies on recovering viral genomes from human faecal samples. Our findings showed that if a single sequencing technology is to be chosen for virome analysis, Illumina is preferable due to its superior ability to recover fully resolved viral genomes and minimise erroneous genomes. While ONT assemblies were effective in recovering viral diversity, the challenges related to input requirements and the necessity for amplification made it less ideal as a standalone solution. However, using a combined, hybrid approach enabled a more authentic representation of viral diversity to be obtained within samples.
