HIV-1 infection is characterized by a massive depletion of mucosal CD4 T cells that triggers a cascade of events ultimately linking gut microbial dysbiosis to HIV-1 disease progression and pathogenesis. The association between HIV infection and the enteric virome composition is less characterized, although viruses are an essential component of the gut ecosystem. Here, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the fecal viral (eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages) and bacterial microbiome in people with HIV (PWH) and in HIV-negative individuals. To gain further insight into the association between the gut microbiome composition, HIV-associated immunodeficiency, and immune recovery, we carried out a longitudinal study including 14 PWH who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) and were followed for 24 months with samplings performed at baseline (before ART) and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months post-ART initiation.
