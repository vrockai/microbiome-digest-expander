_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Higher Trimethylamine-N-Oxide Plasma Levels with Increasing Age Are Mediated by Diet and Trimethylamine-Forming Bacteria.
 28.10.2021, _S Rath, K Rox, S Kleine Bardenhorst, U Schminke, M Dörr, J Mayerle, F Frost, MM Lerch, A Karch, M Brönstrup, DH Pieper, M Vital_


The gut microbiota-dependent metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is linked to an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. Trimethylamine (TMA), which is subsequently oxidized to TMAO in the liver, is formed by intestinal bacteria via distinct biochemical routes from dietary precursors that are enriched in animal product-based foods. To get a full picture of the entire process of the diet &gt; gut microbiota &gt; TMAO axis, we quantified potential TMA-forming gut bacteria and plasma metabolites using gene-targeted assays and targeted metabolomics on a subsample (n = 425) of a German population-based cohort study. We specifically compared persons reporting daily meat intake with those that rarely or never consume meat. While meat intake did not predict TMAO plasma levels in our study, two major bacterial TMA-forming pathways were linked to the metabolite's concentration. Furthermore, advancing age was strongly associated with TMAO. Construction of a structural equation model allowed us to disentangle the different routes that promote higher TMAO levels with increasing age, demonstrating, for the first time, a functional role of gut microbiota in the process, where specific food items augmented abundances of TMA-forming bacteria that were associated with higher TMAO plasma concentrations. Analyses stratified by age showed an association between carotid intima-media thickness and TMAO only in individuals &gt;65 of age, indicating that this group is particularly affected by the metabolite. IMPORTANCE Many cohort studies have investigated the link between diet and plasma TMAO levels, reporting incongruent results, while gut microbiota were only recently included into analyses. In these studies, taxonomic data were recorded that are not a good proxy for TMA formation, as specific members of various taxa exhibit genes catalyzing this reaction, demanding function-based technologies for accurate quantification of TMA-synthesizing bacteria. Using this approach, we demonstrated that abundances of the main components leading to TMAO formation, i.e., TMA precursors and TMA-forming bacteria, are uncoupled and not governed by the same (dietary) factors. Results emphasize that all levels leading to TMA(O) formation should be considered for accurate risk assessment, rejecting the simple view that diets rich in TMA precursors directly lead to increased plasma levels of this hazardous compound. The results can assist in developing strategies to reduce TMAO levels, specifically in the elderly, who are prone to TMAO-associated diseases.

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning Applications in Metagenomic Taxonomy and Functional Annotation.
 02.04.2022, _A Mathieu, M Leclercq, M Sanabria, O Perin, A Droit_


Shotgun sequencing of environmental DNA (i.e., metagenomics) has revolutionized the field of environmental microbiology, allowing the characterization of all microorganisms in a sequencing experiment. To identify the microbes in terms of taxonomy and biological activity, the sequenced reads must necessarily be aligned on known microbial genomes/genes. However, current alignment methods are limited in terms of speed and can produce a significant number of false positives when detecting bacterial species or false negatives in specific cases (virus, plasmids, and gene detection). Moreover, recent advances in metagenomics have enabled the reconstruction of new genomes using de novo binning strategies, but these genomes, not yet fully characterized, are not used in classic approaches, whereas machine and deep learning methods can use them as models. In this article, we attempted to review the different methods and their efficiency to improve the annotation of metagenomic sequences. Deep learning models have reached the performance of the widely used k-mer alignment-based tools, with better accuracy in certain cases; however, they still must demonstrate their robustness across the variety of environmental samples and across the rapid expansion of accessible genomes in databases.

## Unifying the known and unknown microbial coding sequence space.

Genes of unknown function are among the biggest challenges in molecular biology, especially in microbial systems, where 40%-60% of the predicted genes are unknown. Despite previous attempts, systematic approaches to include the unknown fraction into analytical workflows are still lacking. Here, we present a conceptual framework, its translation into the computational workflow AGNOSTOS and a demonstration on how we can bridge the known-unknown gap in genomes and metagenomes. By analyzing 415,971,742 genes predicted from 1,749 metagenomes and 28,941 bacterial and archaeal genomes, we quantify the extent of the unknown fraction, its diversity, and its relevance across multiple organisms and environments. The unknown sequence space is exceptionally diverse, phylogenetically more conserved than the known fraction and predominantly taxonomically restricted at the species level. From the 71M genes identified to be of unknown function, we compiled a collection of 283,874 lineage-specific genes of unknown function for Cand. Patescibacteria (also known as Candidate Phyla Radiation, CPR), which provides a significant resource to expand our understanding of their unusual biology. Finally, by identifying a target gene of unknown function for antibiotic resistance, we demonstrate how we can enable the generation of hypotheses that can be used to augment experimental data.

## TDP-43 and Tau Oligomers in Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Frontotemporal Dementia.
 25.10.2021, _M Montalbano, S McAllen, FL Cascio, U Sengupta, S Garcia, N Bhatt, A Ellsworth, EA Heidelman, OD Johnson, S Doskocil, R Kayed_


_Alzheimer Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, DNA-Binding Proteins, Frontotemporal Dementia, Humans, Pick Disease of the Brain, Protein Aggregation, Pathological, RNA-Binding Proteins, tau Proteins_
Proteinaceous aggregates are major hallmarks of several neurodegenerative diseases. Aggregates of post-translationally modified transactive response (TAR)-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies are characteristic features in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent studies have also reported TDP-43 aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). TDP-43 is an RNA/DNA binding protein (RBP) mainly present in the nucleus. In addition to several RBPs, TDP-43 has also been reported in stress granules in FTD and ALS pathologies. Despite knowledge of cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43, the cellular effects of TDP-43 aggregates and their cytotoxic mechanism(s) remain to be clarified. We hypothesize that TDP-43 forms oligomeric assemblies that associate with tau, another key protein involved in ALS and FTD. However, no prior studies have investigated the interactions between TDP-43 oligomers and tau. It is therefore important to thoroughly investigate the cross-seeding properties and cellular localization of both TDP-43 and tau oligomers in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we demonstrate the effect of tau on the cellular localization of TDP-43 in WT and P301L tau-inducible cell models (iHEK) and in WT HEK-293 cells treated exogenously with soluble human recombinant tau oligomers (Exo-rTauO). We observed cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation o in the presence of tau in these cell models. We also studied the occurrence of TDP-43 oligomers in AD, ALS, and FTD human brain tissue using novel antibodies generated against TDP-43 oligomers as well as generic TDP-43 antibodies. Finally, we examined the cross-seeding property of AD, ALS, and FTD brain-derived TDP-43 oligomers (BDT43Os) on tau aggregation using biochemical and biophysical assays. Our results allow us to speculate that TDP-43/tau interactions might play a role in AD, ALS, and FTD.
