Although the detrimental effects of conventional combustible cigarettes on oral health and dental esthetics are well known, there is limited information about the long-term impact of combustion-free nicotine alternatives (C-F NA) such as e-cigarettes or heated tobacco products.

## The gut ileal mucosal virome is disturbed in patients with Crohn's disease and exacerbates intestinal inflammation in mice.
 23.02.2024, _Z Cao, D Fan, Y Sun, Z Huang, Y Li, R Su, F Zhang, Q Li, H Yang, F Zhang, Y Miao, P Lan, X Wu, T Zuo_


Gut bacteriome dysbiosis is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Crohn's disease (CD) is an IBD subtype with extensive mucosal inflammation, yet the mucosal virome, an empirical modulator of the bacteriome and mucosal immunity, remains largely unclear regarding its composition and role. Here, we exploited trans-cohort CD patients and healthy individuals to compositionally and functionally investigate the small bowel (terminal ileum) virome and bacteriome. The CD ileal virome was characterised by an under-representation of both lytic and temperate bacteriophages (especially those targeting bacterial pathogens), particularly in patients with flare-up. Meanwhile, the virome-bacteriome ecology in CD ileal mucosa was featured by a lack of Bifidobacterium- and Lachnospiraceae-led mutualistic interactions between bacteria and bacteriophages; surprisingly it was more pronounced in CD remission than flare-up, underlining the refractory and recurrent nature of mucosal inflammation in CD. Lastly, we substantiated that ileal virions from CD patients causally exacerbated intestinal inflammation in IBD mouse models, by reshaping a gut virome-bacteriome ecology preceding intestinal inflammation (microbial trigger) and augmenting microbial sensing/defence pathways in the intestine cells (host response). Altogether, our results highlight the significance of mucosal virome in CD pathogenesis and importance of mucosal virome restoration in CD therapeutics.

## Identification and Genome Characterization of a Novel Virus within the Genus Totivirus from Chinese Bayberry (Myrica rubra).
 24.02.2024, _Z Xu, Y Gao, K Teng, H Ge, X Zhang, M Wu, R Li, Z Wu, L Zheng_


Chinese bayberry (Myrica rubra) is an economically significant fruit tree native to eastern Asia and widely planted in south-central China. However, studies about the viruses infecting M. rubra remain largely lacking. In the present study, we employed the metatranscriptomic method to identify viruses in M. rubra leaves exhibiting yellowing and irregular margin symptoms collected in Fuzhou, a city located in China's Fujian province in the year 2022. As a consequence, a novel member of the genus Totivirus was identified and tentatively named "Myrica rubra associated totivirus 1" (MRaTV1). The genome sequencing of MRaTV1 was determined by overlapping reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The two deduced proteins encoded by MRaTV1 have the highest amino acid (aa) sequence identity to the coat protein (CP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of Panax notoginseng virus A (PNVA), a member of the genus Totivirus within the family Totiviridae, at 49.7% and 61.7%, respectively. According to the results of the phylogenetic tree and the species demarcation criteria of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) for the genus Totivirus, MRaTV1 is considered a new member of the genus Totivirus.

## The Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG1 and IgG3 Antibody Isotypes with Limited Neutralizing Capacity against Omicron Elicited in a Latin Population a Switch toward IgG4 after Multiple Doses with the mRNA Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine.

The aim of this study was to analyze the profiles of IgG subclasses in COVID-19 convalescent Puerto Rican subjects and compare these profiles with those of non-infected immunocompetent or immunocompromised subjects that received two or more doses of an mRNA vaccine. The most notable findings from this study are as follows: (1) Convalescent subjects that were not hospitalized developed high and long-lasting antibody responses. (2) Both IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses were more prevalent in the SARS-CoV-2-infected population, whereas IgG1 was more prevalent after vaccination. (3) Individuals that were infected and then later received two doses of an mRNA vaccine exhibited a more robust neutralizing capacity against Omicron than those that were never infected and received two doses of an mRNA vaccine. (4) A class switch toward the "anti-inflammatory" antibody isotype IgG4 was induced a few weeks after the third dose, which peaked abruptly and remained at high levels for a long period. Moreover, the high levels of IgG4 were concurrent with high neutralizing percentages against various VOCs including Omicron. (5) Subjects with IBD also produced IgG4 antibodies after the third dose, although these antibody levels had a limited effect on the neutralizing capacity. Knowing that the mRNA vaccines do not prevent infections, the Omicron subvariants have been shown to be less pathogenic, and IgG4 levels have been associated with immunotolerance and numerous negative effects, the recommendations for the successive administration of booster vaccinations to people should be revised.

## Phase I study of sapanisertib (CB-228/TAK-228/MLN0128) in combination with ziv-aflibercept in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Sapanisertib is a potent ATP-competitive, dual inhibitor of mTORC1/2. Ziv-aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein comprising human VEGF receptor extracellular domains fused to human immunoglobulin G1. HIF-1α inhibition in combination with anti-angiogenic therapy is a promising anti-tumor strategy. This Phase 1 dose-escalation/expansion study assessed safety/ tolerability of sapanisertib in combination with ziv-aflibercept in advanced solid tumors.

## Correlation of Plasmatic Amyloid Beta Peptides (Aβ-40, Aβ-42) with Myocardial Injury and Inflammatory Biomarkers in Acute Coronary Syndrome.
 24.02.2024, _LE Del Moral, C Lerma, H González-Pacheco, AC Chávez-Lázaro, F Massó, E Rodriguez_


Background/Objective: Amyloid beta (β) -40 levels increase with age and inflammation states and appear to be associated with clinical manifestations of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We investigated the correlation of Aβ peptides with myocardial injury and inflammation biomarkers in patients with or without ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, NSTEMI). Methods: This singe-center, cross-sectional, observational, and correlation study included 65 patients with ACS (n = 34 STEMI, 29 males, age = 58 ± 12 years; n = 31 NSTEMI, 22 males, age = 60 ± 12 years) who were enrolled in the coronary care unit within 12 h after symptom onset from February 2022 to May 2023. Aβ peptide levels and biochemical parameters were assessed. Results: NSTEMI patients had a higher prevalence of hypertension (p = 0.039), diabetes (p = 0.043), smoking (p = 0.003), and prior myocardial infarction (p = 0.010) compared to STEMI patients. We observed a higher level of Aβ-42 in NSTEMI (p = 0.001) but no difference in Aβ-40 levels. We also found a correlation between age and NT-proBNP with both Aβ peptides (Aβ-40, Aβ-42) (p = 0.001, p = 0.002 respectively). Conclusions: Our results show that patients with NSTEMI had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and prior myocardial infarction). Considering these results, we propose that Aβ-42 can add value to risk stratification in NSTEMI patients.
