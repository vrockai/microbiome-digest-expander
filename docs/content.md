## Assessing the strength and sensitivity of the core microbiota approach on a highly diverse sponge reef.
 22.08.2020, _C Astudillo-Garc√≠a, JJ Bell, JM Montoya, L Moitinho-Silva, T Thomas, NS Webster, MW Taylor_


Marine sponge reefs usually comprise a complex array of taxonomically different sponge species, many of these hosting highly diverse microbial communities. The number of microbial species known to occupy a given sponge ranges from tens to thousands, bringing numerous challenges to their analysis. One way to deal with such complexity is to use a core microbiota approach, in which only prevalent and abundant microbes are considered. Here we aimed to test the strength and sensitivity of the core microbiota approach by applying different core definitions to 20 host sponge species. Application of increasingly stringent relative abundance and/or percentage occurrence thresholds to qualify as part of the core microbiota decreased the number of 'core' OTUs and phyla and, consequently, changed both alpha- and beta-diversity patterns. Moreover, microbial co-occurrence patterns explored using correlation networks were also affected by core microbiota definition. The application of stricter thresholds resulted in smaller and less compartmentalised networks, with different keystone species. These results highlight that application of different core definitions to phylogenetically disparate host species can result in the drawing of markedly different conclusions. Consequently, we recommend to assess the effects of different core community definitions on the specific system of study before considering its application. This article is protected by copyright.

## Novel bioactive natural products from bacteria via bioprospecting, genome mining and metabolic engineering.
 30.04.2020, _ON Sekurova, O Schneider, SB Zotchev_


_Bacteria, Biological Products, Bioprospecting, Data Mining, Genetics, Microbial, Genome, Bacterial, Metabolic Engineering_
For over seven decades, bacteria served as a valuable source of bioactive natural products some of which were eventually developed into drugs to treat infections, cancer and immune system-related diseases. Traditionally, novel compounds produced by bacteria were discovered via conventional bioprospecting based on isolation of potential producers and screening their extracts in a variety of bioassays. Over time, most of the natural products identifiable by this approach were discovered, and the pipeline for new drugs based on bacterially produced metabolites started to run dry. This mini-review highlights recent developments in bacterial bioprospecting for novel compounds that are based on several out-of-the-box approaches, including the following: (i) targeting bacterial species previously unknown to produce any bioactive natural products, (ii) exploring non-traditional environmental niches and methods for isolation of bacteria and (iii) various types of 'genome mining' aimed at unravelling genetic potential of bacteria to produce secondary metabolites. All these approaches have already yielded a number of novel bioactive compounds and, if used wisely, will soon revitalize drug discovery pipeline based on bacterial natural products.

## Aging and the Combined effects of ADRA2B and CB1 deletions on Affective Working Memory.
 23.03.2020, _B Fairfield, N Mammarella, L Fontanella, A Sarra, M D'Aurora, L Stuppia, V Gatta_


Many studies have found that memory for affective material is better than memory for neutral information and memory for positive material compared to negative material is better in older adults. Behavioral, neurophysiological as well as single polymorphism differences have been advanced to account for these effects. Here, we aimed to examine whether the combination of two polymorphisms (ADRA2B and CB1) in older adults influences active maintenance and manipulation of emotional information in aging working memory. We examined genotype data from 207 older adults (56 double deletion carriers, 116 single deletion carriers and 35 no deletion carriers) who performed a verbal operation span-like task with positive, negative and neutral words. We found that subjects carrying both ADRA2B and CB1 variants generally remembered a higher number of words. In addition, double carriers showed positivity effects while single carriers showed more general emotional enhancement effects, especially as strings lengthened. These findings are amongst the first to suggest a haplotype account of positivity effects in older adults' memory.

## [Association between family history of diabetes and incident diabetes of adults: a prospective study].
 25.08.2020, _J Su, JY Zhou, R Tao, YN Wan, Y Qin, Y Lu, YJ Hua, JR Jin, Z Bian, Y Guo, ZM Chen, M Wu, LM Li_


Objective: To evaluate the association betweew family history of diabetes and incident diabetes of adults. Methods: A total of 49 266 participants in the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) study from Wuzhong district of Suzhou city were included in the analysis, after the exclusion of those with heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes at baseline survey. The person-year of follow-up was calculated from the date on completion of baseline survey to the date on any firstly-occurred event, i.e., diabetes incidence, death, loss of follow-up, or December 31, 2013. Cox regression model was used to estimate the hazards ratios of the association between family history of diabetes and incident diabetes. Results: During 348 677 person-years of the follow-up (median 7.08 years), a total of 423 men and 791 women were diagnosed as having diabetes. Compared to those without diabetic family history, participants with family history of diabetes showed a higher risk of diabetes, with a HR (95%CI) of 1.90 (1.57-2.29), and the risk increased with the number of relatives suffering from diabetes (Pfor trend&lt;0.05). The family history of maternal type, sibling type, and sibling and parental type had a statistically significant association with the risk of diabetes. The adjusted HR (95%CI) was 2.03 (1.45-2.77), 2.07 (1.56-2.68) and 2.39 (1.14-4.34), respectively. Modification effects of tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, body mass index and physical activity on the association between diabetic family history and risk of diabetes were not observed in the study (Pfor interaction &gt;0.05). Conclusions: Diabetic family history is associated with the increased incident diabetes, and the risk increased with the number of relatives suffering from diabetes.
