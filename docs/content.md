## Maternal Vertical Transmission Affecting Early-life Microbiota Development.
 20.12.2019, _S Wang, CA Ryan, P Boyaval, EM Dempsey, RP Ross, C Stanton_


The association of the human microbiome with health outcomes has attracted much interest toward its therapeutic manipulation. The likelihood of modulating the human microbiome in early life is high and offers great potential to exert profound effects on human development since the early microbiota shows more flexibility compared to that of adults. The human microbiota, being similar to human genetics, can be transmitted from mother to infant, providing insights into early microbiota acquisition, subsequent development, and potential opportunities for intervention. Here, we review adaptations of the maternal microbiota during pregnancy, birth, and infancy, the acquisition and succession of early-life microbiota, and highlight recent efforts to elucidate mother-to-infant microbiota transmission. We further discuss how the mother-to-infant microbial transmission is shaped; and finally we address potential directions for future studies to promote our understanding within this field.

## Bacteriophage of the Skin Microbiome in Patients with Psoriasis and Healthy Family Controls.
 22.12.2019, _H Wang, HH Chan, MY Ni, WW Lam, WMM Chan, H Pang_


The bacteriophage (phage) component of the skin microbiome in patients with psoriasis has not been systematically explored. The purpose of this study is to investigate phage and bacterial components of the skin microbiome in patients with psoriasis and in healthy family controls. Lesional skin swabs of four different locations (elbow, forearm, knee, and scalp) were taken from patients with psoriasis. Healthy skin swabs of matched locations were taken from contralateral non-lesional skin and healthy family controls. Skin microbiomes were investigated using next-generation shotgun metagenomics sequencing. 81 skin microbiome samples (27 lesional skin samples and 54 healthy skin samples from contralateral non-lesional skin and family controls) obtained from 16 subjects with psoriasis and 16 matched family controls were sequenced and analyzed. Among phage species with abundant host bacteria, two significantly differential abundant phage species, Acinetobacter phage Presley and Pseudomonas phage O4 (adjusted P &lt; 0.05), between psoriasis lesional skin and healthy skin were identified. Samples with high levels of these phage species had their host bacteria abundance suppressed (P = 0.03 and P &lt; 0.001). Differential phage composition between lesional skin in patients with psoriasis and healthy skin from contralateral non-lesional sites and family controls, as well as the suppression of bacteria host of the respective phage, suggest possible avenues for probiotic phage therapeutics.

## A 28 Day Clinical Assessment of a Lactic Acid-containing Antimicrobial Intimate Gel Wash Formulation on Skin Tolerance and Impact on the Vulvar Microbiome.

While intimate feminine hygiene products are widely used as part of daily cleansing routines, little is known about how these products impact the vulvovaginal area and its microbiome stability. This 4 week clinical study assessed tolerance of a novel gel wash containing lactic acid (pH 4.2) for external daily use when used on the external genital area and its effects on skin moisturization, vulvar skin pH, and the vulvar microbiome. After a 7 day pre-study conditioning period, 36 healthy females in three balanced age groups (18-29, 30-44, and 45-55 years) used the gel wash to cleanse their external genital area (mons pubis and vulva) and entire body at least once per day for 28 days. Skin tolerance of the gel wash was assessed by the gynecologist. Effects of the gel wash on vulvar skin microbiota were studied by performing bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) microbial richness and diversity analysis. Based on gynecologic assessment after 28 days of use, the gel wash showed acceptable tolerance, with no signs of increased dryness, redness, edema, itching, stinging, or burning. Use of the gel wash was associated with a significant increase in both short-term (single application) and longer-term (daily use for 28 days) skin moisturization. There was no significant change in vulvar skin pH over time with daily product use, and the gel wash did not significantly affect the natural vulvar microbiome species richness or diversity for bacteria or fungi. Results showed that this gel wash is a mild, moisturizing cleanser that maintains the natural pH and microbial diversity of vulvar skin. To our knowledge, this was the first study to assess the effect of an antimicrobial feminine gel wash on the natural pH and vulvar microbiome habitat of the skin using bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS genetic sequencing techniques.

## Altered Fecal Microbiome Years after Traumatic Brain Injury.
 13.04.2020, _RJ Urban, RB Pyles, CJ Stewart, N Ajami, KM Randolph, WJ Durham, CP Danesi, EL Dillon, JR Summons, CK Singh, M Morrison, LA Kreber, B Masel, AL Miller, TJ Wright, M Sheffield-Moore_


Patients with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) requiring long-term, permanent care suffer a myriad of clinical symptoms (i.e., impaired cognition, fatigue, and other conditions) that persist for years beyond the acute brain injury. In addition to these comorbid clinical symptoms, chronic TBI patients exhibit altered amino acid and hormonal profiles with distinct cytokine patterns suggesting chronic inflammation. This metabolic link suggests a role of the gut-brain axis in chronic TBI. Thus, we utilized a two-site trial to investigate the role of the gut-brain axis in comorbidities of chronic TBI. The fecal microbiome profile of 22 moderate/severe TBI patients residing in permanent care facilities in Texas and California was compared to 18 healthy age-matched control subjects working within the participating facilities. Each fecal microbiome was characterized by 16S(V4) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and metagenomic genome sequencing approaches followed by confirmatory full 16S rRNA gene sequencing or focused tuf gene speciation and specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction evaluation of selected genera or species. The average chronic TBI patient fecal microbiome structure was significantly different compared to the control cohort, and these differences persisted after group stratification analysis to identify any unexpected confounders. Notably, the fecal microbiome of the chronic TBI cohort had absent or reduced Prevotella spp. and Bacteroidies spp. Conversely, bacteria in the Ruminococcaceae family were higher in abundance in TBI compared to control profiles. Previously reported hypoaminoacidemia, including significantly reduced levels of l-tryptophan, l-sarcosine, ÃŸ-alanine, and alanine, positively correlated with the reduced levels of Prevotella spp. in the TBI cohort samples compared to controls. Although the sequelae of gut-brain axis disruption after TBI is not fully understood, characterizing TBI-related alterations in the fecal microbiome may provide biomarkers and therapeutic targets to address patient morbidity.

## Recent advances in the role of plant metabolites in shaping the root microbiome.
 13.03.2020, _RP Jacoby, L Chen, M Schwier, A Koprivova, S Kopriva_


The last decade brought great progress in describing the repertoire of microbes associated with plants and identifying principles of their interactions. Metabolites exuded by plant roots have been considered candidates for the mechanisms by which plants shape their root microbiome. Here, we review the evidence for several plant metabolites affecting plant interaction with microbes belowground. We also discuss the development of new approaches to study the mechanisms of such interaction that will help to elucidate the metabolic networks in the rhizosphere.
