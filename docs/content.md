Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are commonly integrated into human diet and presumed to be inert; however, animal studies suggest that they may impact the microbiome and downstream glycemic responses. We causally assessed NNS impacts in humans and their microbiomes in a randomized-controlled trial encompassing 120 healthy adults, administered saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia sachets for 2 weeks in doses lower than the acceptable daily intake, compared with controls receiving sachet-contained vehicle glucose or no supplement. As groups, each administered NNS distinctly altered stool and oral microbiome and plasma metabolome, whereas saccharin and sucralose significantly impaired glycemic responses. Importantly, gnotobiotic mice conventionalized with microbiomes from multiple top and bottom responders of each of the four NNS-supplemented groups featured glycemic responses largely reflecting those noted in respective human donors, which were preempted by distinct microbial signals, as exemplified by sucralose. Collectively, human NNS consumption may induce person-specific, microbiome-dependent glycemic alterations, necessitating future assessment of clinical implications.

## A comprehensive evaluation of microbial differential abundance analysis methods: current status and potential solutions.
 22.08.2022, _L Yang, J Chen_


Differential abundance analysis (DAA) is one central statistical task in microbiome data analysis. A robust and powerful DAA tool can help identify highly confident microbial candidates for further biological validation. Numerous DAA tools have been proposed in the past decade addressing the special characteristics of microbiome data such as zero inflation and compositional effects. Disturbingly, different DAA tools could sometimes produce quite discordant results, opening to the possibility of cherry-picking the tool in favor of one's own hypothesis. To recommend the best DAA tool or practice to the field, a comprehensive evaluation, which covers as many biologically relevant scenarios as possible, is critically needed.

Probiotics and synbiotics have been proposed to exhibit an important role in glucose homeostasis and maintain the balance of the gut microbiota. However, clinical trials have shown mixed findings. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of probiotics and synbiotics intake on glycemic outcomes among individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The PubMed/Medline, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane library were searched up to March 2022 for published RCTs exploring the effectiveness of probiotics and synbiotics compared to control on glycemic outcomes. The random-effects model was applied in order to the estimation of 95% confidence interval (CI) and the weighted mean difference (WMD) for each endpoint. Meta-analysis of forty-six RCTs (3067 participants) showed that probiotics and synbiotics supplementation significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (weighted mean difference (WMD): -11.18mg/dl, 95% CI: -13.60, -8.75, p ˂0.001), fasting insulin serum level (WMD: -1.23 µIU/ml, 95% CI: -1.76, -0.71, p ˂0.001), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (WMD: -0.35%, 95% CI: -0.44, -0.26, p˂0.001), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (WMD: -0.87, 95% CI: -1.09, -0.65, p˂0.001). Additionally, probiotics and synbiotics intake resulted in an increase in values of quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (WMD: 0.01, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.01, p˂0.001). However, probiotics and synbiotics consumption did not change glucose values following oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Our findings suggest that probiotic and synbiotic intake has favorable effects on glycemic profile in patients with prediabetes and T2DM.

## The diversity and abundance of gut microbiota are associated with the pain sensation threshold in the Japanese population.
 21.08.2022, _Y Takeuchi, H Mizukami, K Kudoh, S Osonoi, T Sasaki, H Kushibiki, S Ogasawara, Y Hara, A Igawa, X Pan, T Yamada, K Yamazaki, T Mikami, M Daimon, S Yagihashi, K Hakamada, S Nakaji_


Small fibre neuropathy (SFN) is an initial pathology of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). Serum lipopolysaccharide binding protein levels are positively correlated with the pain threshold in the foot, suggesting that the abundance of gut Gram-negative bacilli, which are a source of lipopolysaccharides, may be involved in the development of DPN. Furthermore, the abundance of the gut and oral microbiota is assumed to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Nevertheless, the association between SFN and the microbiota has not been clarified. A total of 1056 individuals were recruited in the 2018 Iwaki Health Promotion Project. Pain sensation was evaluated based on the pain threshold from intraepidermal electrical stimulation (PINT). Patients with PINT scores &lt;0.15 mA were categorized into the low-PINT group (n = 718); otherwise, they were categorized into the high-PINT group (n = 283). Furthermore, each group was divided into the subjects with or without glucose tolerance based on HbA1c levels, fasting blood glucose levels and diabetic history. Principal coordinate analysis and α- and β-diversity of the microbiota were evaluated. The correlation between clinical and microbiota data was examined. Oral microbiota diversity showed no structural differences according to PINT scores, whereas principal coordinate analysis and α- and β-diversity revealed significant structural differences in gut microbiota (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively), even after the participants with glucose intolerance were excluded (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). The relative abundance of the genus Bacteroides was significantly lower in high-PINT participants compared with low-PINT participants (10 ± 6.7% vs. 11.3 ± 7.0%, p &lt; 0.01), even after the exclusion of subjects with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (10.0 ± 6.5% vs. 11.2 ± 6.9%, p &lt; 0.05). In univariate linear regression analyses, PINT was significantly correlated with metabolic syndrome parameters, eGFR, uric acid level and the abundance of Bacteroides. The correlation between Bacteroides and PINT scores remained significant after adjustment for multiple factors (β = -0.07181, p &lt; 0.05). Changes of bacterial diversity and a low abundance of gut Bacteroides were correlated with elevated PINT scores in the Japanese population. This correlation may represent a new therapeutic option for SFN.

## Oral microbiota associated with gingiva of healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis cases.
 21.08.2022, _NA Hussein, ZS Soliman, MF Edrees_


Oral microbes coexist with each other in a symbiotic relationship or as commensals in healthy body. Teeth and oral cavity harbor diverse community of fungi and bacteria. This study focused on bacterial and fungal component of gingiva, where the last occupy little attention. In addition to study the antimicrobial activity of toothpastes, mouth washes and natural oils against microorganisms. Sixty swabs from outer surfaces of gingiva in healthy persons, as well as patients complaining of gingivitis and periodontitis were collected for fungal and bacterial analyses. Sensitivity of the isolated microorganisms to some pharmaceutical preparations and natural oils was also performed. Ten fungal and 9 bacterial species were identified. There is a highly significant variation in the frequency of Klebsiella pneumonia among healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis. Also, Candida tropicalis and cocci bacteria showed significant diversity among the three tested groups. Among pharmaceutical preparations (toothpastes and mouth washes) and natural oils, Paradontax, Hexitol and clove oil showed the best antimicrobial activity against tested fungal and bacterial strains. Although, minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) of clove oil were high compared to Paradontax and Hexitol, nevertheless, it is highly recommended as both antifungal and antibacterial agent against oral pathogenic microorganisms, because it is a natural compound and nearly devoid of side effects.

## Effects of extracellular vesicles derived from oral bacteria on osteoclast differentiation and activation.
 22.08.2022, _HY Kim, MK Song, Y Lim, JS Jang, SJ An, HH Kim, BK Choi_


Dysbiosis of the oral microbiota plays an important role in the progression of periodontitis, which is characterized by chronic inflammation and alveolar bone loss, and associated with systemic diseases. Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain various bioactive molecules and show diverse effects on host environments depending on the bacterial species. Recently, we reported that EVs derived from Filifactor alocis, a Gram-positive periodontal pathogen, had osteoclastogenic activity. In the present study, we analysed the osteoclastogenic potency and immunostimulatory activity of EVs derived from the Gram-negative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, the oral commensal bacterium Streptococcus oralis, and the gut probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri. Bacterial EVs were purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation using OptiPrep (iodixanol) reagent. EVs from P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and S. oralis increased osteoclast differentiation and osteoclstogenic cytokine expression in osteoclast precursors, whereas EVs from L. reuteri did not. EVs from P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and S. oralis preferentially activated Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) rather than TLR4 or TLR9, and induced osteoclastogenesis mainly through TLR2. The osteoclastogenic effects of EVs from P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were reduced by both lipoprotein lipase and polymyxin B, an inhibitor of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while the osteoclastogenic effects of EVs from S. oralis were reduced by lipoprotein lipase alone. These results demonstrate that EVs from periodontal pathogens and oral commensal have osteoclastogenic activity through TLR2 activation by lipoproteins and/or LPS.

## The Role of a Gut Microbial-Derived Metabolite, Trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO), in Neurological Disorders.
 20.08.2022, _SS Praveenraj, S Sonali, N Anand, HA Tousif, C Vichitra, M Kalyan, PV Kanna, KA Chandana, P Shasthara, AM Mahalakshmi, J Yang, SR Pandi-Perumal, MK Sakharkar, SB Chidambaram_


Trimethylamine lyases are expressed in a wide range of intestinal microbiota which metabolize dietary nutrients like choline, betaine, and L-carnitine to form trimethylamine (TMA). Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is an oxidative product of trimethylamine (TMA) catalyzed by the action of flavin monooxygenases (FMO) in the liver. Higher levels of TMAO in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been shown to contribute to the development of risk factors and actively promote the pathogenesis of metabolic, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases. The investigations on the harmful effects of TMAO in the development and progression of neurodegenerative and sleep disorders are summarized in this manuscript. Clinical investigations on the role of TMAO in predicting risk factors and prognostic factors in patients with neurological disorders are also summarized. It is observed that the mechanisms underlying TMAO-mediated pathogenesis include activation of inflammatory signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κβ), NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and MAPK/JNK in the periphery and brain. Data suggests that TMAO levels increase with age-related cognitive dysfunction and also induce mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuronal senescence, and synaptic damage in the brain. Further research into the relationships between dietary food consumption and gut microbiota-dependent TMAO levels could provide novel therapeutic options for neurological illnesses.

## The association between early-life gut microbiota and childhood respiratory diseases: a systematic review.
 21.08.2022, _CG Alcazar, VM Paes, Y Shao, C Oesser, A Miltz, TD Lawley, P Brocklehurst, A Rodger, N Field_


Data from animal models suggest a role of early-life gut microbiota in lung immune development, and in establishing susceptibility to respiratory infections and asthma in humans. This systematic review summarises the association between infant (ages 0-12 months) gut microbiota composition measured by genomic sequencing, and childhood (ages 0-18 years) respiratory diseases (ie, respiratory infections, wheezing, or asthma). Overall, there was evidence that low α-diversity and relative abundance of particular gut-commensal bacteria genera (Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, and Roseburia) are associated with childhood respiratory diseases. However, results were inconsistent and studies had important limitations, including insufficient characterisation of bacterial taxa to species level, heterogeneous outcome definitions, residual confounding, and small sample sizes. Large longitudinal studies with stool sampling during the first month of life and shotgun metagenomic approaches to improve bacterial and fungal taxa resolution are needed. Standardising follow-up times and respiratory disease definitions and optimising causal statistical approaches might identify targets for primary prevention of childhood respiratory diseases.

## Effect of probiotic supplementation on plasma metabolite profile after Roux-Y gastric bypass: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

There is evidence that metabolic profile changes after Roux-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), especially due to modifications in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, previous studies have suggested that probiotics can modify the microbiome and produce metabolites important for metabolic health maintenance. In this sense, the aim of this study was to verify the influence of probiotic supplementation on the plasma metabolite profile after RYGB.
