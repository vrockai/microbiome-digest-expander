Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) affects a significant proportion of patients receiving antibiotics. We sought to understand if differences in the gut microbiome would influence the development of AAD. We administered a 3-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate to 30 healthy adult volunteers, and analyzed their stool microbiome, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, at baseline and up to 4 weeks post antibiotic administration. Lower levels of gut Ruminococcaceae were significantly and consistently observed from baseline until day 7 in participants who developed AAD. Overall, participants who developed AAD experienced a greater decrease in microbial diversity. The probability of AAD could be predicted based on qPCR-derived levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii at baseline. Our findings suggest that a lack of gut Ruminococcaceae influences development of AAD. Quantification of F. prausnitzii in stool prior to antibiotic administration may help identify patients at risk of AAD, and aid clinicians in devising individualized treatment regimens to minimize such adverse effects.

The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) remains obscure. Recently, the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis's role in MDD has an increasing attention. However, the specific mechanism of the multi-level effects of gut microbiota on host metabolism, immunity, and brain structure is unclear. Multi-omics approaches based on the analysis of different body fluids and tissues using a variety of analytical platforms have the potential to provide a deeper understanding of MGB axis disorders. Therefore, the data of metagenomics, metabolomic, inflammatory factors, and MRI scanning are collected from the two groups including 24 drug-naïve MDD patients and 26 healthy controls (HCs). Then, the correlation analysis is performed in all omics. The results confirmed that there are many markedly altered differences, such as elevated Actinobacteria abundance, plasma IL-1β concentration, lipid, vitamin, and carbohydrate metabolism disorder, and diminished grey matter volume (GMV) of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the MDD patients. Notably, three kinds of discriminative bacteria, Ruminococcus bromii, Lactococcus chungangensis, and Streptococcus gallolyticus have an extensive correlation with metabolome, immunology, GMV, and clinical symptoms. All three microbiota are closely related to IL-1β and lipids (as an example, phosphoethanolamine (PEA)). Besides, Lactococcus chungangensis is negatively related to the GMV of left IFG. Overall, this study demonstrate that the effects of gut microbiome exert in MDD is multifactorial.

Several approaches to manipulate the gut microbiome for improving the activity of cancer immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are currently under evaluation. Here, we show that oral supplementation with the polyphenol-rich berry camu-camu (CC, Myrciaria dubia) in mice shifted gut microbial composition, which translated into antitumor activity and a stronger anti-PD-1 response. We identified castalagin, an ellagitannin, as the active compound in CC. Oral administration of castalagin enriched for bacteria associated with efficient immunotherapeutic responses (Ruminococcaceae and Alistipes) and improved the CD8+/Foxp3+CD4+ ratio within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, castalagin induced metabolic changes, resulting in an increase in taurine conjugated bile acids. Oral supplementation of castalagin following fecal microbiota transplantation from ICI-refractory patients into mice supported anti-PD-1 activity. Finally, we found that castalagin binds to Ruminococcus bromii and promoted an anticancer response. Altogether, our results identify castalagin as a polyphenol that acts as a prebiotic to circumvent anti-PD-1 resistance.

## Genome-Resolved Metagenomics Reveals Distinct Phosphorus Acquisition Strategies between Soil Microbiomes.
 11.01.2022, _X Wu, C Rensing, D Han, KQ Xiao, Y Dai, Z Tang, W Liesack, J Peng, Z Cui, F Zhang_


Enhancing soil phosphate solubilization is a promising strategy for agricultural sustainability, while little is known about the mechanisms of how microorganisms cope with differing phosphorus availability. Using a combination of genome-resolved metagenomics and amplicon sequencing, we investigated the microbial mechanisms involved in phosphorus cycling under three agricultural treatments in a wheat-maize rotation system and two natural reforestation treatments. Available soil phosphorus was the key factor shaping bacterial and fungal community composition and function across our agricultural and reforestation sites. Membrane-bound quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (PQQGDH) and exopolyphosphatases (PPX) governed microbial phosphate solubilization in agroecosystems. In contrast, genes encoding glycerol-3-phosphate transporters (ugpB, ugpC, and ugpQ) displayed a significantly greater abundance in the reforestation soils. The gcd gene encoding PQQGDH was found to be the best determinant for bioavailable soil phosphorus. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliated with Cyclobacteriaceae and Vicinamibacterales were obtained from agricultural soils. Their MAGs harbored not only gcd but also the pit gene encoding low-affinity phosphate transporters. MAGs obtained from reforestation soils were affiliated with Microtrichales and Burkholderiales. These contain ugp genes but no gcd, and thereby are indicative of a phosphate transporter strategy. Our study demonstrates that knowledge of distinct microbial phosphorus acquisition strategies between agricultural and reforestation soils could help in linking microbial processes with phosphorus cycling. IMPORTANCE The soil microbiome is the key player regulating phosphorus cycling processes. Identifying phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and utilizing them for release of recalcitrant phosphate that is bound to rocks or minerals have implications for improving crop nutrient acquisition and crop productivity. In this study, we combined functional metagenomics and amplicon sequencing to analyze microbial phosphorus cycling processes in natural reforestation and agricultural soils. We found that the phosphorus acquisition strategies significantly differed between these two ecosystems. A microbial phosphorus solubilization strategy dominated in the agricultural soils, while a microbial phosphate transporter strategy was observed in the reforestation soils. We further identified microbial taxa that contributed to enhanced phosphate solubilization in the agroecosystem. These microbes are predicted to be beneficial for the increase in phosphate bioavailability through agricultural practices.

An increasing number of studies now produce multiple omics measurements that require using sophisticated computational methods for analysis. While each omics data can be examined separately, jointly integrating multiple omics data allows for deeper understanding and insights to be gained from the study. In particular, data integration can be performed horizontally, where biological entities from multiple omics measurements are mapped to common reactions and pathways. However, data integration remains a challenge due to the complexity of the data and the difficulty in interpreting analysis results.

## Aristotle: stratified causal discovery for omics data.
 16.01.2022, _M Mansouri, S Khakabimamaghani, L Chindelevitch, M Ester_


There has been a simultaneous increase in demand and accessibility across genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data, known as omics data. This has encouraged widespread application of omics data in life sciences, from personalized medicine to the discovery of underlying pathophysiology of diseases. Causal analysis of omics data may provide important insight into the underlying biological mechanisms. Existing causal analysis methods yield promising results when identifying potential general causes of an observed outcome based on omics data. However, they may fail to discover the causes specific to a particular stratum of individuals and missing from others.

A proportion of patients surviving acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection develop post-acute COVID syndrome (long COVID (LC)) lasting longer than 12 weeks. Here, we studied individuals with LC compared to age- and gender-matched recovered individuals without LC, unexposed donors and individuals infected with other coronaviruses. Patients with LC had highly activated innate immune cells, lacked naive T and B cells and showed elevated expression of type I IFN (IFN-β) and type III IFN (IFN-λ1) that remained persistently high at 8 months after infection. Using a log-linear classification model, we defined an optimal set of analytes that had the strongest association with LC among the 28 analytes measured. Combinations of the inflammatory mediators IFN-β, PTX3, IFN-γ, IFN-λ2/3 and IL-6 associated with LC with 78.5-81.6% accuracy. This work defines immunological parameters associated with LC and suggests future opportunities for prevention and treatment.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious respiratory virus which is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is increasingly clear that recovered individuals, even those who had mild COVID-19, can suffer from persistent symptoms for many months after infection, a condition referred to as "long COVID", post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, or post COVID-19 condition. However, despite the plethora of research on COVID-19, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of these long-term effects.
