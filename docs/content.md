## Effect of Electronic Health Record Reminders for Routine Immunizations and Immunizations Needed for Chronic Medical Conditions.
 15.12.2021, _AB Stephens, CS Wynn, AM Hofstetter, C Kolff, O Pena, E Kahn, B Dasgupta, K Natarajan, DK Vawdrey, MM Lane, L Robbins-Milne, R Ramakrishnan, S Holleran, MS Stockwell_


Immunization reminders in electronic health records (EHR) provide clinical decision support (CDS) that can reduce missed immunization opportunities. Little is known about using CDS rules from a regional immunization information system (IIS) to power local EHR immunization reminders.

Araruama Lagoon is an environment characterized by high salt concentrations. The low raining and high evaporation rates in this region favored the development of many salty ponds around the lagoon. In order to reveal the microbial composition of this system, we performed a 16S rRNA gene survey. Among archaea, most clones were related to uncultured environmental Euryarchaeota. In lagoon water, we found some clones related to Methanomicrobia and Methanothermococcus groups, while in the saline pond water members related to the genus Haloarcula were detected. Bacterial community was dominated by clones related to Gamma-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Synechococcus in lagoon water, while Salinibacter ruber relatives dominated in saline pond. We also detected the presence of Alpha-proteobacteria, Pseudomonas-like bacteria and Verrucomicrobia. Only representatives of the genus Ralstonia were cosmopolitan, being observed in both systems. The detection of a substantial number of clones related to uncultured archaea and bacteria suggest that the hypersaline waters of Araruama harbor a pool of novel prokaryotic phylotypes, distinct from those observed in other similar systems. We also observed clones related to halophilic genera of cyanobacteria that are specific for each habitat studied. Additionally, two bacterioplankton molecular markers with ecological relevance were analyzed, one is linked to nitrogen fixation (nifH) and the other is linked to carbon fixation by bacterial photosynthesis, the protochlorophyllide genes, revealing a specific genetic distribution in this ecosystem. This is the first study of the biogeography and community structure of microbial assemblages in Brazilian tropical hypersaline environments. This work is directed towards a better understanding of the free-living prokaryotic diversity adapted to life in hypersaline waters.

## Characteristics and Outcomes of Ventricular Tachycardia and Premature Ventricular Contractions Ablation in Patients with Prior Mitral Valve Surgery.

Data regarding ventricular tachycardia (VT) or premature ventricular complex (PVC) ablation following mitral valve surgery (MVS) is limited. Catheter ablation (CA) can be challenging given perivalvular substrate in the setting of mitral annuloplasty or prosthetic valves.

## Factors influencing the microbial composition of human milk.

Aside from nutritional components, human milk is rich in microorganisms. Through breastfeeding these microorganisms are introduced to the infant gut where they may transiently or persistently colonize it. Therefore, the human milk microbiota may be an important factor which shapes the infant gut microbiota further influencing infant health and disease. In the current review we aim to give a brief updated insight into the putative origin of the human milk microbiota, its constituents and the possible factors that shape it. Understanding the factors that determine the human milk microbiota composition and function will aid developing optimal postnatal feeding and intervention strategies to reduce the risk of communicable and noncommunicable diseases.

## Ageing and rejuvenation models reveal changes in key microbial communities associated with healthy ageing.
 15.12.2021, _J Shin, JR Noh, D Choe, N Lee, Y Song, S Cho, EJ Kang, MJ Go, SK Ha, DH Chang, JH Kim, YH Kim, KS Kim, H Jung, MH Kim, BH Sung, SG Lee, DH Lee, BC Kim, CH Lee, BK Cho_


The gut microbiota is associated with diverse age-related disorders. Several rejuvenation methods, such as probiotic administration and faecal microbiota transplantation, have been applied to alter the gut microbiome and promote healthy ageing. Nevertheless, prolongation of the health span of aged mice by remodelling the gut microbiome remains challenging.

## The economical lifestyle of CPR bacteria in groundwater allows little preference for environmental drivers.

The highly diverse Cand. Patescibacteria are predicted to have minimal biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, which hinders understanding of how their populations differentiate in response to environmental drivers or host organisms. Their mechanisms employed to cope with oxidative stress are largely unknown. Here, we utilized genome-resolved metagenomics to investigate the adaptive genome repertoire of Patescibacteria in oxic and anoxic groundwaters, and to infer putative host ranges.
