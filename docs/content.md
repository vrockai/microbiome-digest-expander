This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Latent antibiotic resistance genes are abundant, diverse, and mobile in human, animal, and environmental microbiomes.
 10.03.2023, _JS Inda-Díaz, D Lund, M Parras-Moltó, A Johnning, J Bengtsson-Palme, E Kristiansson_


_Animals, Humans, Drug Resistance, Microbial, Microbiota, Metagenome, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Databases, Factual_
Bacterial communities in humans, animals, and the external environment maintain a large collection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, few of these ARGs are well-characterized and thus established in existing resistance gene databases. In contrast, the remaining latent ARGs are typically unknown and overlooked in most sequencing-based studies. Our view of the resistome and its diversity is therefore incomplete, which hampers our ability to assess risk for promotion and spread of yet undiscovered resistance determinants.

Early-life microbial colonization of the skin may modulate the immune system and impact the development of atopic dermatitis (AD) and allergic diseases later in life. To address this question, we assessed the association between the skin microbiome and AD, skin barrier integrity and allergic diseases in the first year of life. We further explored the evolution of the skin microbiome with age and its possible determinants, including delivery mode.

## Microbiome in urological diseases: Axis crosstalk and bladder disorders.
 11.03.2023, _HW Choi, KW Lee, YH Kim_


_Female, Humans, Urinary Bladder, Urinary Bladder Diseases, Urologic Diseases, Kidney, Microbiota_
Since the identification of the human urinary microbiome, numerous studies have characterized this microbial community and improved our knowledge of its association with urinary diseases. This association between urinary diseases and microbiota is not confined to the urinary microbiota; it is interconnected with the microbiota of other organs. The gastrointestinal, vaginal, kidney, and bladder microbiota all affect urinary diseases because they work with their respective organs to control the growth and operation of the immune, metabolic, and nervous systems through dynamic bidirectional communication along the bladder-centered axis. Therefore, disturbances in the microbial communities may result in the emergence of urinary diseases. In this review, we describe the increasing and intriguing evidence of complicated and critical relationships that may contribute to the development and progression of urinary diseases through disruption of the microbiota in various organs.

## Human microbiome variance is underestimated.
 08.03.2023, _F Shanahan, TS Ghosh, PW O'Toole_


Most of the variance in the human microbiome remains unexplained. Although an extensive list of individual lifestyles shaping the microbiome has been identified, important gaps in knowledge persist. Most human microbiome data are from individuals living in socioeconomically developed countries. This may have skewed the interpretation of microbiome variance and its relationship to health and disease. Moreover, striking under-representation of minority groups in microbiome studies is a missed opportunity to assess context, history and the changing nature of the microbiome in relation to the risk of disease. Therefore, we focus here on areas of recent progress - ageing and ethnicity - both of which contribute to microbiome variance with particular lessons for the promise of microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

## Population-level impacts of antibiotic usage on the human gut microbiome.

The widespread usage of antimicrobials has driven the evolution of resistance in pathogenic microbes, both increased prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and their spread across species by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). However, the impact on the wider community of commensal microbes associated with the human body, the microbiome, is less well understood. Small-scale studies have determined the transient impacts of antibiotic consumption but we conduct an extensive survey of ARGs in 8972 metagenomes to determine the population-level impacts. Focusing on 3096 gut microbiomes from healthy individuals not taking antibiotics we demonstrate highly significant correlations between both the total ARG abundance and diversity and per capita antibiotic usage rates across ten countries spanning three continents. Samples from China were notable outliers. We use a collection of 154,723 human-associated metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) to link these ARGs to taxa and detect HGT. This reveals that the correlations in ARG abundance are driven by multi-species mobile ARGs shared between pathogens and commensals, within a highly connected central component of the network of MAGs and ARGs. We also observe that individual human gut ARG profiles cluster into two types or resistotypes. The less frequent resistotype has higher overall ARG abundance, is associated with certain classes of resistance, and is linked to species-specific genes in the Proteobacteria on the periphery of the ARG network.

A high rate of COVID-19 vaccination is critical to reduce morbidity and mortality related to infection and to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the factors that influence vaccine confidence can inform policies and programs aimed at vaccine promotion. We examined the impact of health literacy on COVID-19 vaccine confidence among a diverse sample of adults living in two major metropolitan areas.

## Milk glycan metabolism by intestinal bifidobacteria: insights from comparative genomics.
 03.03.2023, _AA Arzamasov, AL Osterman_


Bifidobacteria are early colonizers of the human neonatal gut and provide multiple health benefits to the infant, including inhibiting the growth of enteropathogens and modulating the immune system. Certain Bifidobacterium species prevail in the gut of breastfed infants due to the ability of these microorganisms to selectively forage glycans present in human milk, specifically human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and N-linked glycans. Therefore, these carbohydrates serve as promising prebiotic dietary supplements to stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria in the guts of children suffering from impaired gut microbiota development. However, the rational formulation of milk glycan-based prebiotics requires a detailed understanding of how bifidobacteria metabolize these carbohydrates. Accumulating biochemical and genomic data suggest that HMO and N-glycan assimilation abilities vary remarkably within the Bifidobacterium genus, both at the species and strain levels. This review focuses on the delineation and genome-based comparative analysis of differences in respective biochemical pathways, transport systems, and associated transcriptional regulatory networks, providing a foundation for genomics-based projection of milk glycan utilization capabilities across a rapidly growing number of sequenced bifidobacterial genomes and metagenomic datasets. This analysis also highlights remaining knowledge gaps and suggests directions for future studies to optimize the formulation of milk-glycan-based prebiotics that target bifidobacteria.

COVID-19 pandemic-related building restrictions heightened drinking water microbiological safety concerns post-reopening due to the unprecedented nature of commercial building closures. Starting with phased reopening (i.e., June 2020), we sampled drinking water for 6 months from three commercial buildings with reduced water usage and four occupied residential households. Samples were analyzed using flow cytometry and full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing along with comprehensive water chemistry characterization. Prolonged building closures resulted in 10-fold higher microbial cell counts in the commercial buildings [(2.95 ± 3.67) × 105 cells mL-1] than in residential households [(1.11 ± 0.58) × 104 cells mL-1] with majority intact cells. While flushing reduced cell counts and increased disinfection residuals, microbial communities in commercial buildings remained distinct from those in residential households on the basis of flow cytometric fingerprinting [Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (dBC) = 0.33 ± 0.07] and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (dBC = 0.72 ± 0.20). An increase in water demand post-reopening resulted in gradual convergence in microbial communities in water samples collected from commercial buildings and residential households. Overall, we find that the gradual recovery of water demand played a key role in the recovery of building plumbing-associated microbial communities as compared to short-term flushing after extended periods of reduced water demand.
