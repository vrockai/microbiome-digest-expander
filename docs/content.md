## Health beneficial effects of resistant starch on diabetes and obesity via regulation of gut microbiota: a review.
 30.06.2020, _H Liu, M Zhang, Q Ma, B Tian, C Nie, Z Chen, J Li_


Resistant starch (RS) is well known to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Recently, attention has been paid to gut microbiota which mediates the RS's impact on T2DM and obesity, while a mechanistic understanding of how RS prevents T2DM and obesity through gut microbiota is not clear yet. Therefore, this review aims at exploring the underlying mechanisms of it. RS prevents T2DM and obesity through gut microbiota by modifying selective microbial composition to produce starch-degrading enzymes, promoting the production of intestinal metabolites, and improving gut barrier function. Therefore, RS possessing good functional features can be used to increase the fiber content of healthier food. Furthermore, achieving highly selective effects on gut microbiota based on the slight differences of RS's chemical structure and focusing on the effects of RS on strain-levels are essential to manipulate the microbiota for human health.

## Inflammation in Mental Disorders: Is the Microbiota the Missing Link?
 27.06.2020, _S Ouabbou, Y He, K Butler, M Tsuang_


Research suggests that inflammation is important in the pathophysiology of mental disorders. In addition, a growing body of evidence has led to the concept of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. To understand the potential interactions, we begin by exploring the liaison between the immune system and mental disorders, then we describe the evidence that the microbiota impact the immune response in the developing brain. Next, we review the literature that has documented microbiome alterations in major mental disorders. We end with a summary of therapeutic applications, ranging from psycho-biotics to immunomodulatory drugs that could affect the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and potential treatments to alleviate the adverse effects of antipsychotics. We conclude that there is promising evidence to support the position that the microbiota plays an important role in the immunological pathophysiology of mental disorders with an emphasis on psychotic disorders and mood disorders. However, more research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms.

## Changes of the human skin microbiota upon chronic exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollutants.
 30.06.2020, _MHY Leung, X Tong, P Bastien, F Guinot, A Tenenhaus, BMR Appenzeller, RJ Betts, S Mezzache, J Li, N Bourokba, L Breton, C Clavaud, PKH Lee_


Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are of environmental and public health concerns and contribute to adverse skin attributes such as premature skin aging and pigmentary disorder. However, little information is available on the potential roles of chronic urban PAH pollutant exposure on the cutaneous microbiota. Given the roles of the skin microbiota have on healthy and undesirable skin phenotypes and the relationships between PAHs and skin properties, we hypothesize that exposure of PAHs may be associated with changes in the cutaneous microbiota. In this study, the skin microbiota of over two hundred Chinese individuals from two cities in China with varying exposure levels of PAHs were characterized by bacterial and fungal amplicon and shotgun metagenomics sequencing.

## Lizard gut microbiome changes with temperature and is associated with heat tolerance.
 27.06.2020, _AH Moeller, K Ivey, MB Cornwall, K Herr, J Rede, EN Taylor, AR Gunderson_


Vertebrates harbor trillions of microorganisms in the gut, collectively termed the gut microbiota, which affect a wide range of host functions. Recent experiments in lab-reared vertebrates have shown that changes in environmental temperature can induce shifts in the gut microbiota, and in some cases these gut-microbiota shifts have been shown to affect host thermal physiology. However, there is a lack of information about the effects of temperature on the gut microbiota of wild-caught vertebrates. Moreover, in ectotherms, which are particularly vulnerable to changing temperature regimes, the extent to which microbiota composition is shaped by temperature and associated with host thermal tolerance has not been investigated. To address these issues, we monitored the gut-microbiota composition of wild-caught Western Fence Lizards (sp, Sceloporus occidentalis) experimentally exposed to a cool-to-warm temperature transition. Comparing experimentally exposed and control lizards indicated that warm temperatures altered and destabilized the composition of the S. occidentalis gut microbiota. Warming drove a significant reduction in the relative abundances of a clade of Firmicutes, a significant increase in the rate of compositional turnover in the gut microbiota within individual lizards, and increases in the abundances of bacteria from predicted pathogenic clades. In addition, the composition of the microbiota was significantly associated with the thermal tolerance of lizards measured at the end of the experiment. These results suggest that temperature can alter the lizard gut microbiota, with potential implications for the physiological performance and fitness of natural populations.Importance All animals harbor gut microbial communities that affect their hosts in numerous ways, motivating investigations of the factors that shape the gut microbiota and the consequences of gut-microbiota variation for host traits. In this study, we test the effects of increases in environmental temperatures on the gut microbiota of fence lizards, a vertebrate ectotherm threatened by warming climates. By monitoring lizards and their gut microbes during an experimental temperature treatment, we show that the warming altered and destabilized the lizard gut microbiota. Moreover, measuring thermal performance of lizard hosts at the end of the experiment indicated that the composition of the gut microbiota was associated with host thermal tolerance. These results indicate that warming temperatures can alter the gut microbiota of vertebrate ectotherms, and suggest relationships between variation in the gut microbiota and the thermal physiology of natural host populations.

Chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has led to population declines and extinctions of frog species around the world. While it is known that symbiotic skin bacteria can play a protective role against pathogens, it is not known how these defensive bacteria are integrated into the bacterial community on amphibian skin. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, culturing and Bd inhibition bioassays to characterize the communities of skin bacteria on three Neotropical frog species that persist in a Bd-infected area in Panama and determined the abundance and integration of anti-Bd bacteria into the community. We found that the two treefrog species had a similar bacterial community structure, which differed from the more diverse community found on the terrestrial frog. Co-occurrence networks also revealed differences between frog species such that the treefrogs had a significantly higher number of culturable Bd-inhibitory OTUs with high centrality scores compared with the terrestrial frog. We found that culture-dependent OTUs captured between 21 and 39% of the total relative abundance revealed in culture-independent communities. Our results suggest different ecological strategies occurring within skin antifungal communities on host species that have not succumbed to Bd infections in the wild.

## Bacterial diversity associated with the abdomens of naturally Plasmodium-infected and non-infected Nyssorhynchus darlingi.
 29.06.2020, _TMP Oliveira, SS Sanabani, MAM Sallum_


The bacterial community present in the abdomen in Anophelinae mosquitoes can influence mosquito susceptibility to Plasmodium infection. Little is known about the bacteria associated with Nyssorhynchus darlingi, a primary malaria vector in the Amazon basin. We investigated the abdominal bacterial community compositions of naturally Plasmodium-infected (P-positive, n = 9) and non-infected (P-negative, n = 7) Ny. darlingi from the Brazilian Amazon region through massive parallel sequencing of the bacterial V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene.

## Evaluating the impact of domestication and captivity on the horse gut microbiome.

The mammal gut microbiome, which includes host microbes and their respective genes, is now recognized as an essential second genome that provides critical functions to the host. In humans, studies have revealed that lifestyle strongly influences the composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiome. We hypothesized that these trends in humans may be paralleled in mammals subjected to anthropogenic forces such as domestication and captivity, in which diets and natural life histories are often greatly modified. We investigated fecal microbiomes of Przewalski's horse (PH; Equus ferus przewalskii), the only horses alive today not successfully domesticated by humans, and herded, domestic horse (E. f. caballus) living in adjacent natural grasslands. We discovered PH fecal microbiomes hosted a distinct and more diverse community of bacteria compared to domestic horses, which is likely partly explained by different plant diets as revealed by trnL maker data. Within the PH population, four individuals were born in captivity in European zoos and hosted a strikingly low diversity of fecal microbiota compared to individuals born in natural reserves in France and Mongolia. These results suggest that anthropogenic forces can dramatically reshape equid gastrointestinal microbiomes, which has broader implications for the conservation management of endangered mammals.

## A genomic view of trophic and metabolic diversity in clade-specific Lamellodysidea sponge microbiomes.
 26.06.2020, _S Podell, JM Blanton, A Oliver, MA Schorn, V Agarwal, JS Biggs, BS Moore, EE Allen_


Marine sponges and their microbiomes contribute significantly to carbon and nutrient cycling in global reefs, processing and remineralizing dissolved and particulate organic matter. Lamellodysidea herbacea sponges obtain additional energy from abundant photosynthetic Hormoscilla cyanobacterial symbionts, which also produce polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) chemically similar to anthropogenic pollutants of environmental concern. Potential contributions of non-Hormoscilla bacteria to Lamellodysidea microbiome metabolism and the synthesis and degradation of additional secondary metabolites are currently unknown.

## Functional Associations and Resilience in Microbial Communities.
 30.06.2020, _ML Avila-Jimenez, G Burns, Z He, J Zhou, A Hodson, JL Avila-Jimenez, D Pearce_


Microbial communities have inherently high levels of metabolic flexibility and functional redundancy, yet the structure of microbial communities can change rapidly with environmental perturbation. To understand whether such changes observed at the taxonomic level translate into differences at the functional level, we analyzed the structure of taxonomic and functional gene distribution across Arctic and Antarctic locations. Taxonomic diversity (in terms of alpha diversity and species richness) differed significantly with location. However, we found that functional genes distributed evenly across bacterial networks and that this functional distribution was also even across different geographic locations. For example, on average 15% of the functional genes were related to carbon cycling across all bacterial networks, slightly over 21% of the genes were stress-related and only 0.5% of the genes were linked to carbon degradation functions. In such a distribution, each bacterial network includes all of the functional groups distributed following the same proportions. However, the total number of functional genes that is included in each bacterial network differs, with some clusters including many more genes than others. We found that the proportion of times a specific gene must occur to be linked to a specific cluster is 8%, meaning the relationship between the total number of genes in the cluster and the number of genes per function follows a linear pattern: smaller clusters require a gene to appear less frequently to get fixed within the cluster, while larger clusters require higher gene frequencies. We suggest that this mechanism of functional association between equally rare or equally abundant genes could have implications for ecological resilience, as non-dominant genes also associate in fully functioning ecological networks, potentially suggesting that there are always pre-existing functional networks available to exploit new ecological niches (where they can become dominant) as they emerge; for example, in the case of rapid or sudden environmental change. Furthermore, this pattern did not correlate with taxonomic distribution, suggesting that bacteria associate based on functionality and this is independent of its taxonomic position. Our analyses based on ecological networks also showed no clear evidence of recent environmental impact on polar marine microbial communities at the functional level, unless all communities analyzed have changed exactly in the same direction and intensity, which is unlikely given we are comparing areas changing at different rates.

## Reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance genes in retail raw milk.
 30.06.2020, _J Liu, Y Zhu, M Jay-Russell, DG Lemay, DA Mills_


It has been estimated that at least 3% of the USA population consumes unpasteurized (raw) milk from animal sources, and the demand to legalize raw milk sales continues to increase. However, consumption of raw milk can cause foodborne illness and be a source of bacteria containing transferrable antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the microbiome and antibiotic resistome in both raw and processed milk, we systematically analyzed 2034 retail milk samples including unpasteurized milk and pasteurized milk via vat pasteurization, high-temperature-short-time pasteurization, and ultra-pasteurization from the United States using complementary culture-based, 16S rRNA gene, and metagenomic sequencing techniques.
