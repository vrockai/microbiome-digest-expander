Gingivitis-the inflammation of the gums-is a reversible stage of periodontal disease. It is caused by dental plaque formation due to poor oral hygiene. However, gingivitis susceptibility involves a complex set of interactions between the oral microbiome, oral metabolome and the host. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of the oral microbiome and its interactions with the salivary metabolome during experimental gingivitis in a cohort of 41 systemically healthy participants. We use Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC), which is a multi-way generalization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that can model the variability in the response due to subjects, variables and time. Using the modelled responses, we identified microbial subcommunities with similar dynamics that connect to the magnitude of the gingivitis response. By performing high level integration of the predicted metabolic functions of the microbiome and salivary metabolome, we identified pathways of interest that describe the changing proportions of Gram-positive and Gram-negative microbiota, variation in anaerobic bacteria, biofilm formation and virulence.

## Establishing human microbial observatory programs in low- and middle-income countries.
 19.09.2024, _JI Gordon, MJ Barratt, MC Hibberd, M Rahman, T Ahmed_


Studies of the human microbiome are progressing rapidly but have largely focused on populations living in high-income countries. With increasing evidence that the microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases that affect infants, children, and adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and with profound and rapid ongoing changes occurring in our lifestyles and biosphere, understanding the origins of and developing microbiome-directed therapeutics for treating a number of global health challenges requires the development of programs for studying human microbial ecology in LMICs. Here, we discuss how the establishment of long-term human microbial observatory programs in selected LMICs could provide one timely approach.

## Dynamics of the microbiome and volatile organic compounds during fermentation and aging of soy sauce.
 20.09.2024, _Y Mizuno, T Yoshimura, K Sawada, K Tsuge, Y Nagano, Y Yoshizaki, M Goto, G Kobayashi_


A comprehensive analysis of the microbiome and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the moromi of soy sauce during fermentation and aging was conducted under industrial production. Microbiome analysis using next-generation sequencing revealed the presence and dynamics of microorganisms other than Aspergillus, Tetragenococcus, Zygosaccharomyces, and Wickerhamiella, which were used as starters. The bacterial community of the moromi on the first day of this process was rich in diversity. Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Kurthia, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus, and Macrococcus that grew during koji making were relatively dominant. However, as the fermentation progressed, only Tetragenococcus became dominant in the bacterial communities. In contrast, the fungal community was simple at the beginning of fermentation and aging, with Aspergillus present almost exclusively. After adding Zygosaccharomyces rouxii on day 42, the fungal community changed significantly. At the end of fermentation and aging, the fungal community diversified, with Millerozyma, Wickerhamiella, Yamadazyma, and Saccharomycopsis becoming dominant. The analysis of VOC showed that the VOC profile changed during fermentation and aging, and that the VOC profile changed significantly after adding Z. rouxii. The correlation analysis between the microbiome and VOC showed that Wickerhamiella, Millerozyma, Debaryomyces, Yamadazyma, and Candida had a significant positive correlation with alcohols, esters, and phenols produced in the later stage of fermentation and aging, indicating that not only Z. rouxii but also various fungi may contribute to the formation of the complex aroma profile of soy sauce.

## Pseudomonas fluorescens Inoculation Enhances Salix matsudana Growth by Modifying Phyllosphere Microbiomes, Surpassing Nitrogen Fertilization.
 20.09.2024, _Q Li, Y He, J Feng, Y He, S Zhang_


The enhancement of plant growth by soil fertilization and microbial inoculation involves different mechanisms, particularly by altering the phyllosphere microbiome. This study investigated how nitrogen (N) fertilization, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain R124 inoculation and their combined effects influence the growth of different-aged Salix matsudana cuttings by modulating N dynamics within the phyllosphere microbiome. Results showed that P. fluorescens inoculation was significantly more effective than N fertilization alone, enhancing biomass, plant nutrient uptake, soil nutrient content and root development by 90.51%, 18.18%, 72.74% and 126.20%, respectively. Crucially, the inoculation notably shifted the beta-diversity of the phyllosphere microbial community, with K-strategy fungi enhancing plant N fixation and subsequent plant growth. Cuttings from middle-aged forests displayed more robust growth than those from young-aged, associated with a varied impact on phyllosphere fungi, notably increasing the relative abundance of Myriangiales in young (76.37%) and Capnodiales in middle-aged cuttings (42.37%), which improve phyllosphere stability and plant health. These findings highlight the effectiveness of microbial inoculation over N fertilization in promoting plant growth and provide valuable insights for the sustainable management of willow plantations at different stages of development.

## Deep insights into the assembly mechanisms, co-occurrence patterns, and functional roles of microbial community in wastewater treatment plants.
 20.09.2024, _ZY Wei, M Feng, DX Zhang, CY Jiang, Y Deng, ZJ Wang, K Feng, Y Song, N Zhou, YL Wang, SJ Liu_


The understanding of activated sludge microbial status and roles is imperative for improving and enhancing the performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, we conducted a deep analysis of activated sludge microbial communities across five compartments (inflow, effluent, and aerobic, anoxic, anaerobic tanks) over temporal scales, employing high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons and metagenome data. Clearly discernible seasonal patterns, exhibiting cyclic variations, were observed in microbial diversity, assembly, co-occurrence network, and metabolic functions. Notably, summer samples exhibited higher Î±-diversity and were distinctly separated from winter samples. Our analysis revealed that microbial community assembly is influenced by both stochastic processes (66%) and deterministic processes (34%), with winter samples demonstrating more random assembly compared to summer. Co-occurrence patterns were predominantly mutualistic, with over 96% positive correlations, and summer networks were more organized than those in winter. These variations were significantly correlated with temperature, total phosphorus and sludge volume index. However, no significant differences were found among microbial community across five compartments in terms of Î² diversity. A core community of keystone taxa was identified, playing key roles in eight nitrogen and eleven phosphorus cycling pathways. Understanding the assembly mechanisms, co-occurrence patterns, and functional roles of microbial communities is essential for the design and optimization of biotechnological treatment processes in WWTPs.

## Genomic profiling of Antarctic geothermal microbiomes using long-read, Hi-C, and single-cell techniques.

Geothermal features in Antarctica provide favorable conditions for diverse microorganisms, yet their genomic diversity remains poorly understood. Here, we present an integrated dataset comprising PacBio HiFi and Hi-C metagenomic sequencing, along with single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) from two high-altitude geothermal sites, Mount Melbourne and Mount Rittmann, in Antarctica. The long-read HiFi sequencing, coupled with Hi-C, enhances the understanding of microbiome diversity and functionality in this unique ecosystem by providing more complete and accurate genomic information. SAGs complement this by recovering rare microbial taxa and offering a strain-resolved perspective. This dataset aims to deepen our understanding of microbial evolution and ecology in Antarctic geothermal environments, and facilitate cross-comparison with other geothermal environments globally.
