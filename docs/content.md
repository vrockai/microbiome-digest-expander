## Immunity to commensal skin fungi promotes psoriasiform skin inflammation.

Under steady-state conditions, the immune system is poised to sense and respond to the microbiota. As such, immunity to the microbiota, including T cell responses, is expected to precede any inflammatory trigger. How this pool of preformed microbiota-specific T cells contributes to tissue pathologies remains unclear. Here, using an experimental model of psoriasis, we show that recall responses to commensal skin fungi can significantly aggravate tissue inflammation. Enhanced pathology caused by fungi preexposure depends on Th17 responses and neutrophil extracellular traps and recapitulates features of the transcriptional landscape of human lesional psoriatic skin. Together, our results propose that recall responses directed to skin fungi can directly promote skin inflammation and that exploration of tissue inflammation should be assessed in the context of recall responses to the microbiota.

## Current knowledge on the human eye microbiome: a systematic review of available amplicon and metagenomic sequencing data.
 30.06.2020, _H Delbeke, S Younas, I Casteels, M Joossens_


Insights in the ocular surface microbiome are still at an early stage and many more questions remain unanswered compared with other human-associated microbial communities. The current knowledge on the human microbiome changed our viewpoint on bacteria and human health and significantly enhanced our understanding of human pathophysiology. Also in ocular medicine, microbiome research might impact treatment. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on ocular microbiome research with a particular focus on potential confounding factors and their effects on microbiome composition. Moreover, we present the ocular surface core microbiome based on current available data and defined it as genera present in almost half of the published control cohorts with a relative abundance of at least 1%.

## Blood Bacterial Profiles Associated with HIV Infection and Immune Recovery.
 30.06.2020, _S Serrano-Villar, S Sanchez-Carrillo, A Talavera-Rodríguez, B Lelouvier, C Gutiérrez, A Vallejo, F Servant, JI Bernadino, V Estrada, N Madrid, MJ Gosalbes, O Bisbal, M de Lagarde, J Martínez-Sanz, R Ron, S Herrera, S Moreno, M Ferrer_


HIV infection impairs mucosal immunity and leads to bacterial translocation, fueling chronic inflammation and disease progression. While this is well established, questions remain about the compositional profile of the translocated bacteria, and to what extent it is influenced by ART. Using 16S rDNA targeted sequencing and shotgun proteomics, we show that HIV increases bacterial translocation from the gut to the blood. HIV increased α-diversity in the blood, which was dominated by aerobic bacteria belonging to Micrococcaceae (Actinobacteria) and Pseudomonadaceae (Proteobacteria) families, and the number of circulating bacterial proteins was also increased. Forty-eight weeks of ART attenuated this phenomenon. We found that enrichment with Lactobacillales order, and depletion of Actinobacteria class and Moraxellaceae and Corynebacteriacae families, were significantly associated with greater immune recovery and correlated with several inflammatory markers. Our findings suggest that the molecular crosstalk between the host and the translocated bacterial products could influence ART-mediated immune recovery.

## Sex-Specific Associations between Gut Prevotellaceae and Host Genetics on Adiposity.
 25.06.2020, _A Cuevas-Sierra, JI Riezu-Boj, E Guruceaga, FI Milagro, JA Martínez_


The gut microbiome has been recognized as a tool for understanding adiposity accumulation and for providing personalized nutrition advice for the management of obesity and accompanying metabolic complications. The genetic background is also involved in human energy homeostasis. In order to increase the value of nutrigenetic dietary advice, the interplay between genetics and microbiota must be investigated. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate interactive associations between gut microbiota composition and 95 obesity-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) searched in the literature. Oral mucosa and fecal samples from 360 normal weight, overweight and obese subjects were collected. Next generation genotyping of these 95 SNPs and fecal 16S rRNA sequencing were performed. A genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed with 10 SNPs statistically or marginally associated with body mass index (BMI). Several microbiome statistical analyses at family taxonomic level were applied (LEfSe, Canonical Correspondence Analysis, MetagenomeSeq and Random Forest), and Prevotellaceae family was found in all of them as one of the most important bacterial families associated with BMI and GRS. Thus, in this family it was further analyzed the interactive association between BMI and GRS with linear regression models. Interestingly, women with higher abundance of Prevotellaceae and higher GRS were more obese, compared to women with higher GRS and lower abundance of Prevotellaceae. These findings suggest relevant interrelationships between Prevotellaceae and the genetic background that may determine interindividual BMI differences in women, which opens the way to new precision nutrition-based treatments for obesity.

## The microbiome in inflammatory bowel diseases: from pathogenesis to therapy.
 30.06.2020, _S Liu, W Zhao, P Lan, X Mou_


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has become a global disease with accelerating incidence worldwide in the 21st century while its accurate etiology remains unclear. In the past decade, gut microbiota dysbiosis has consistently been associated with IBD. Although many IBD-associated dysbiosis have not been proven to be a cause or an effect of IBD, it is often hypothesized that at least some of alteration in microbiome is protective or causative. In this article, we selectively reviewed the hypothesis supported by both association studies in human and pathogenesis studies in biological models. Specifically, we reviewed the potential protective bacterial pathways and species against IBD, as well as the potential causative bacterial pathways and species of IBD. We also reviewed the potential roles of some members of mycobiome and virome in IBD. Lastly, we covered the current status of therapeutic approaches targeting microbiome, which is a promising strategy to alleviate and cure this inflammatory disease.

## MetaRibo-Seq measures translation in microbiomes.
 30.06.2020, _BJ Fremin, H Sberro, AS Bhatt_


No method exists to measure large-scale translation of genes in uncultured organisms in microbiomes. To overcome this limitation, we develop MetaRibo-Seq, a method for simultaneous ribosome profiling of tens to hundreds of organisms in microbiome samples. MetaRibo-Seq was benchmarked against gold-standard Ribo-Seq in a mock microbial community and applied to five different human fecal samples. Unlike RNA-Seq, Ribo-Seq signal of a predicted gene suggests it encodes a translated protein. We demonstrate two applications of this technique: First, MetaRibo-Seq identifies small genes, whose identification until now has been challenging. For example, MetaRibo-Seq identifies 2,091 translated, previously unannotated small protein families from five fecal samples, more than doubling the number of small proteins predicted to exist in this niche. Second, the combined application of RNA-Seq and MetaRibo-Seq identifies differences in the translation of transcripts. In summary, MetaRibo-Seq enables comprehensive translational profiling in microbiomes and identifies previously unannotated small proteins.
