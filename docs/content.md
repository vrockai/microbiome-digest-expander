## Gut Microbial Trimethylamine is Elevated in Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis and Contributes to Ethanol-Induced Liver Injury in Mice.
 29.01.2022, _RN Helsley, T Miyata, A Kadam, V Venkateshwari, N Sangwan, EC Huang, R Banerjee, AL Brown, KK Fung, W Massey, C Neumann, O Danny, LJ Osborn, RC Schugar, MR McMullen, A Bellar, KL Poulsen, A Kim, V Pathak, M Mrdjen, JT Anderson, B Willard, CJ McClain, M Mitchell, AJ McCullough, S Radaeva, B Barton, G Szabo, S Dasarathy, JC Garcia-Garcia, DM Rotroff, DS Allende, Z Wang, SL Hazen, LE Nagy, JM Brown_


There is mounting evidence that microbes resident in the human intestine contribute to diverse alcohol-associated liver diseases (ALD) including the most deadly form known as alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). However, mechanisms by which gut microbes synergize with excessive alcohol intake to promote liver injury are poorly understood. Furthermore, whether drugs that selectively target gut microbial metabolism can improve ALD has never been tested. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantify the levels of microbe and host choline co-metabolites in healthy controls and AH patients, finding elevated levels of the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) in AH. In subsequent studies, we treated mice with non-lethal bacterial choline TMA lyase (CutC/D) inhibitors to blunt gut microbe-dependent production of TMA in the context of chronic ethanol administration. Indices of liver injury were quantified by complementary RNA sequencing, biochemical, and histological approaches. In addition, we examined the impact of ethanol consumption and TMA lyase inhibition on gut microbiome structure via 16S rRNA sequencing. We show the gut microbial choline metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) is elevated in AH patients and correlates with reduced hepatic expression of the TMA oxygenase flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). Provocatively, we find that small molecule inhibition of gut microbial CutC/D activity protects mice from ethanol-induced liver injury. CutC/D inhibitor-driven improvement in ethanol-induced liver injury is associated with distinct reorganization of the gut microbiome and host liver transcriptome. The microbial metabolite TMA is elevated in patients with AH, and inhibition of TMA production from gut microbes can protect mice from ethanol-induced liver injury.

## Intestinal gluconeogenesis shapes gut microbiota, fecal and urine metabolome in mice with gastric bypass surgery.
 30.01.2022, _J Vily-Petit, A Barataud, C Zitoun, A Gautier-Stein, M Serino, G Mithieux_


Intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN), gastric bypass (GBP) and gut microbiota positively regulate glucose homeostasis and diet-induced dysmetabolism. GBP modulates gut microbiota, whether IGN could shape it has not been investigated. We studied gut microbiota and microbiome in wild type and IGN-deficient mice, undergoing GBP or not, and fed on either a normal chow (NC) or a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. We also studied fecal and urine metabolome in NC-fed mice. IGN and GBP had a different effect on the gut microbiota of mice fed with NC and HFHS diet. IGN inactivation increased abundance of Deltaproteobacteria on NC and of Proteobacteria such as Helicobacter on HFHS diet. GBP increased abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria on NC-fed WT mice and of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria on HFHS-fed WT mice. The combined effect of IGN inactivation and GBP increased abundance of Actinobacteria on NC and the abundance of Enterococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae on HFHS diet. A reduction was observed in the amounf of short-chain fatty acids in fecal (by GBP) and in both fecal and urine (by IGN inactivation) metabolome. IGN and GBP, separately or combined, shape gut microbiota and microbiome on NC- and HFHS-fed mice, and modify fecal and urine metabolome.

## Fungal endophytes vary by species, tissue type, and life cycle stage in intertidal macroalgae.
 28.01.2022, _G Bonthond, A Barilo, RJ Allen, M Cunliffe, SA Krueger-Hadfield_


Whereas fungal symbionts of terrestrial plants are among the most widespread and well-studied symbioses, relatively little is known about fungi that are associated with macroalgae. To fill the gap in marine fungal taxonomy, we combined simple culture methods with amplicon sequencing to characterize the fungal communities associated with three brown (Sargassum muticum, Pelvetia canaliculata, Himanthalia elongata) and two red (Mastocarpus stellatus, Chondrus crispus) macroalgae from one intertidal zone. In addition to characterizing novel fungal diversity, we tested three hypotheses: fungal diversity and community composition vary (i) among species distributed at different tidal heights, (ii) among tissue types (apices, mid-thallus, and stipe), and (iii) among 'isomorphic' C. crispus life cycle stages. Almost 70% of our reads were classified as Ascomycota, 29% as Basidiomycota, and 1% that could not be classified to phylum. Thirty fungal isolates were obtained, 18 of which were also detected with amplicon sequencing. Fungal communities differed by host and tissue type. Interestingly, P. canaliculata, a fucoid at the extreme high intertidal, did not show differences in fungal diversity across the thallus. As found in filamentous algal endophytes, fungal diversity varied among the three life cycle stages in C. crispus. Female gametophytes were also compositionally more dispersed as compared to the less variable tetrasporophytes and male gametophytes. We demonstrate the power of combining relatively simple cultivation and sequencing approaches to characterize and study macroalgal-fungal associations and highlight the need to understand the role of fungi in near-shore marine ecosystems.

## Soil microbial community development across a 32-year coastal wetland restoration time series and the relative importance of environmental factors.
 26.01.2022, _KM Abbott, T Quirk, LM Fultz_


Soil microbes play key roles in ecosystem functioning through processes such as organic matter decomposition, nutrient and carbon cycling, and regulating vegetation structure and productivity. Coastal marshes are situated at the confluence of terrestrial and marine ecosystems; thus, their soils support abundant and diverse microbiota which facilitate globally important biogeochemical processes including nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas fluxes. With coastal marsh ecosystems threatened by relative sea level rise, subsidence, and development, mitigation for the loss of marshes is becoming commonplace. Despite the widespread implementation of marsh construction projects, little is known about the development and variability of microbial communities in created marshes. For this study, we tested the hypothesis that microbial community composition differs across created marshes of different ages and between created and natural marshes. We also hypothesized that the microbial community would be correlated with soil properties including soil organic carbon and nitrogen content, which were predicted to increase with marsh age. To test these hypotheses, we determined dominant microbial groups and environmental characteristics from six constructed marshes ranging in age from 0 to 32 years old, as well as an adjacent natural marsh. Our results revealed that microbial biomass estimates increased with marsh age except for the high elevation 20-year old marsh, yet each marsh contained a distinct microbial community composition. Across marshes, microbial community composition was significantly related to soil C:N ratio with an increase in total microbial abundance and actinomycetes and GM+ bacteria with an increase in soil C to N ratio. Additionally, shifts in dominant microbial groups were associated with differences in vegetation, elevation, and marsh age. The natural marsh community grouped more closely with younger rather than older marshes suggesting age is less important than environmental conditions. This study shows that microbial communities are not homogenized across restoration sites and do not necessarily converge to be similar to natural marshes over time. Local biotic and environmental conditions were correlated with microbial compositions, yet in seemingly similar conditions, microbial groups also differed. The effect of differences in microbial compositions on ecological functions are yet to be fully understood.

## Emerging investigator series: microplastic sources, fate, toxicity, detection, and interactions with micropollutants in aquatic ecosystems - a review of reviews.
 26.01.2022, _M Ateia, G Ersan, MG Alalm, DC Boffito, T Karanfil_


Hundreds of review studies have been published focusing on microplastics (MPs) and their environmental impacts. With the microbiota colonization of MPs being firmly established, MPs became an important carrier for contaminants to step inside the food web all the way up to humans. Thus, the continuous feed of MPs into the ecosystem has sparked a multitude of scientific concerns about their toxicity, characterization, and interactions with microorganisms and other contaminants. The reports of common subthemes have agreed about many findings and research gaps but also showed contradictions about others. To unravel these equivocal conflicts, we herein compile all the major findings and analyze the paramount discrepancies among these review papers. Furthermore, we systematically reviewed all the highlights, research gaps, concerns, and future needs. The covered focus areas of MPs' literature include the sources, occurrence, fate, existence, and removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), toxicity, interaction with microbiota, sampling, characterization, data quality, and interaction with other co-contaminants. This study reveals that many mechanisms of MPs' behavior in aquatic environments like degradation and interaction with microbiota are yet to be comprehended. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical need to standardize methods and parameters for MP characterization to improve the comparability and reproducibility of the incoming research.

## Alternating Dual-Collision Energy Scanning Mass Spectrometry Approach: Discovery of Novel Microbial Bile-Acid Conjugates.
 27.01.2022, _QF Zhu, YZ Wang, N An, JD Hao, PC Mei, YL Bai, YN Hu, PR Bai, YQ Feng_


Bile acids (BAs) are a type of gut microbiota-host cometabolites with abundant structural diversity, and they play critical roles in maintaining host-microbiota homeostasis. In this study, we developed a new N-(4-aminomethylphenyl) pyridinium (AMPP) derivatization-assisted alternating dual-collision energy scanning mass spectrometry (AMPP-dual-CE MS) method for the profiling of BAs derived from host-gut microbiota cometabolism in mice. Using the proposed method, we discovered two new types of amino acid conjugations (alanine conjugation and proline conjugation) and acetyl conjugation with host BAs, for the first time, from mouse intestine contents and feces. Additionally, we also determined and identified nine new leucine- and phenylalanine-conjugated BAs. These findings broaden our knowledge of the composition of the BA pool and provide insight into the mechanism of host-gut microbiota cometabolism of BAs.
