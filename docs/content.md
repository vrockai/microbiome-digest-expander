Adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic autoinflammatory disease, characterised by fever, arthritis, and skin rash, and joint involvement is one of its clinical manifestations. The aims of this work were to assess joint involvement, to describe main patterns of involvement, and associated clinical characteristics. In this work, we aimed at assessing the joint involvement in AOSD by using MRI, to describe main patterns and associated clinical characteristics. In addition, we aimed at assessing the global transcriptomic profile of synovial tissues in AOSD to elucidate possible pathogenic pathways involved. We also evaluated the global transcriptomic profile of synovial tissues to elucidate possible pathogenic pathways involved in the disease. Thus, AOSD patients, who underwent to MRI exam on joints, were assessed to describe patterns of joint involvement and associated clinical characteristics. Some synovial tissues were collected for RNA-sequencing purposes. The most common MRI finding was the presence of synovitis on 60.5%, mainly in peripheral affected joints, with low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-fat-saturated weighted and STIR images. Bone oedema and MRI-bone erosions were reported on 34.9% and 25.6% MRI exams, respectively. Patients with MRI-bone erosions showed a higher prevalence of splenomegaly, a more frequent chronic disease course, lower levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and ferritin. In AOSD synovial tissues, a hyper-expression of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and TNF pathways was shown together with ferritin genes. In conclusion, in AOSD patients, the most common MRI-finding was the presence of synovitis, characterised by intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-fat-saturated weighted and STIR images. MRI-bone erosions and bone oedema were also observed. In AOSD synovial tissues, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF pathways together with ferritin genes resulted to be hyper-expressed.

## Updated Treatment for Acne: Targeted Therapy Based on Pathogenesis.
 11.06.2021, _I Kurokawa, AM Layton, R Ogawa_


Previous approaches to acne management have focused on the four main factors implicated in acne, namely, androgen-mediated sebogenesis (considered integral to acne), hyperkeratinization, colonization with Cutibacterium acnes, and inflammation related to both innate and adaptive mechanisms. Recent advances have facilitated potential novel approaches to acne management, as the pathophysiology and the immunological aspects related to acne and wound healing have evolved. Particular targets that have been shown to be closely involved in acne pathophysiology and wound healing include interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Biological antibodies targeting IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23, and TNFα could provide novel approaches for treating severe acne and related disorders. Acne is primarily a disease associated with sebogenesis. Monosaturated free acids are important components. Insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) promotes the proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes and IL-1β. Research into the microbiome may also provide insights into potential future therapeutic options for acne. Scars, both atrophic and hypertrophic, are common sequelae to acne. Risk factors associated with the development of acne scars include genetic, systemic, local, and lifestyle factors. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to play a crucial role in the development of acne-induced hypertrophic scars. Treatment for extensive inflammatory keloid scarring is limited. Surgery and postoperative radiotherapy are two possible options. Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), IGF-1, and B cells are found in keloid or hypertrophic scar tissues. Biological antibodies targeting these cytokines may be a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of this type of scar in the future. Future treatment for acne should embrace approaches that target the main etiological factors of acne. In particular, specific emphasis on aggressive treatment in the acute inflammatory phase to reduce the likelihood of scarring and other clinical sequelae, such as pigmentary changes would be highly desirable. Treatment for established acne-induced sequelae should also be considered.

## Cellular and molecular mediators of lymphangiogenesis in inflammatory bowel disease.
 14.06.2021, _DKW Ocansey, B Pei, X Xu, L Zhang, CV Olovo, F Mao_


Recent studies reporting the intricate crosstalk between cellular and molecular mediators and the lymphatic endothelium in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) suggest altered inflammatory cell drainage and lymphatic vasculature, implicating the lymphatic system as a player in the occurrence, development, and recurrence of intestinal diseases. This article aims to review recent data on the modulatory functions of cellular and molecular components of the IBD microenvironment on the lymphatic system, particularly lymphangiogenesis. It serves as a promising therapeutic target for IBD management and treatment. The interaction with gut microbiota is also explored.
