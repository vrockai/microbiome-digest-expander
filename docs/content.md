Antibiotics disrupt normal gut microbiota and cause dysbiosis, leading to a reduction in intestinal epithelial barrier function. Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, which is known as "leaky gut", results in increased intestinal permeability and contributes to the development or exacerbation of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. We have previously reported on a murine model of intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction associated with dysbiosis induced by the administration of ampicillin and vancomycin. Saireito, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, is often used to treat autoimmune disorders including ulcerative colitis; the possible mechanism of action and its efficacy, however, remains unclear. In this study, we examined the efficacy of Saireito in our animal model for leaky gut associated with dysbiosis. C57BL/6 mice were fed a Saireito diet for the entirety of the protocol (day1-28). To induce colitis, ampicillin and vancomycin were administered in drinking water for the last seven consecutive days (day22-28). As previously demonstrated, treatment with antibiotics caused fecal occult bleeding, cecum enlargement with black discoloration, colon inflammation with epithelial cell apoptosis, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Oral administration of Saireito significantly improved antibiotics-induced fecal occult bleeding and cecum enlargement by suppressing inflammation in the colon. Furthermore, Saireito treatment ensured the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier by suppressing apoptosis and inducing cell adhesion proteins including ZO-1, occludin, and E-cadherin in intestinal epithelial cells, which in turn decreased intestinal epithelial permeability. Moreover, the reduced microbial diversity seen in the gut of mice treated with antibiotics was remarkably improved with the administration of Saireito. In addition, Saireito altered the composition of gut microbiota in these mice. These results suggest that Saireito alleviates leaky gut caused by antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Our findings provide a potentially new therapeutic strategy for antibiotic-related gastrointestinal disorders.

## The Microbial Community and Functional Potential in the Midland Basin Reveal a Community Dominated by Both Thiosulfate and Sulfate-Reducing Microorganisms.
 13.06.2022, _K Tinker, D Lipus, J Gardiner, M Stuckman, D Gulliver_


The Permian Basin is the highest producing oil and gas reservoir in the United States. Hydrocarbon resources in this region are often accessed by unconventional extraction methods, including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Despite the importance of the Permian Basin, there is no publicly available microbiological data from this region. We completed an analysis of Permian produced water samples to understand the dynamics present in hydraulically fractured wells in this region. We analyzed produced water samples taken from 10 wells in the Permian region of the Midland Basin using geochemical measurements, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and metagenomic sequencing. Compared to other regions, we found that Permian Basin produced water was characterized by higher sulfate and lower total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations, with a median of 1,110 mg/L and 107,000 mg/L. Additionally, geochemical measurements revealed the presence of frac hits, or interwell communication events where an established well is affected by the pumping of fracturing fluid into a new well. The occurrence of frac hits was supported by correlations between the microbiome and the geochemical parameters. Our 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified a produced water microbiome characterized by anaerobic, halophilic, and sulfur reducing taxa. Interestingly, sulfate and thiosulfate reducing taxa including Halanaerobium, Orenia, Marinobacter, and Desulfohalobium were the most prevalent microbiota in most wells. We further investigated the metabolic potential of microorganisms in the Permian Basin with metagenomic sequencing. We recovered 15 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from seven different samples representing 6 unique well sites. These MAGs corroborated the high presence of sulfate and thiosulfate reducing genes across all wells, especially from key taxa including Halanaerobium and Orenia. The observed microbiome composition and metabolic capabilities in conjunction with the high sulfate concentrations demonstrate a high potential for hydrogen sulfide production in the Permian Basin. Additionally, evidence of frac hits suggests the possibility for the exchange of microbial cells and/or genetic information between wells. This exchange would increase the likelihood of hydrogen sulfide production and has implications for the oil and gas industry. IMPORTANCE The Permian Basin is the largest producing oil and gas region in the United States and plays a critical role supplying national energy needs. Previous work in other basins has demonstrated that the geochemistry and microbiology of hydrocarbon regions can have a major impact on well infrastructure and production. Despite that, little work has been done to understand the complex dynamics present in the Permian Basin. This study characterizes and analyzes 10 unique wells and one groundwater sample in the Permian Basin using geochemical and microbial techniques. Across all wells we found a high number of classic and thiosulfate reducers, suggesting that hydrogen sulfide production may be especially prevalent in the Permian Basin. Additionally, our analysis revealed a biogeochemical signal impacted by the presence of frac hits, or interwell communication events where an established well is affected by the pumping of fracturing fluid into a new well. This information can be utilized by the oil and gas industry to improve oil recovery efforts and minimize commercial and environmental costs.

## Performance of the TaqMan COVID-19 Pooling Kit for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic and symptomatic populations.

Clinical evidence for asymptomatic cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reinforced the significance of effective surveillance testing programs. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays are considered the 'gold standard' for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. However, the labor and resource requirements can be prohibitive with respect to large testing volumes associated with the pandemic. Pooled testing algorithms may serve to increase testing capacity with more efficient resource utilization. Due to the lack of carefully curated cohorts, there is limited evidence for the applicability of RT-PCR pooling in asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. In this study, we compared the analytical sensitivity of the TaqMan™ SARS-CoV-2 Pooling Assay to detect one positive sample in a pool of five anterior nares swabs in symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts at an institute of higher education. Positive pools were deconvoluted and each individual sample was retested using the TaqPath™ COVID-19 Combo Kit. Both assays target the open reading frame (ORF) 1ab, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) gene of the strain that originated in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Qualitative results demonstrated absolute agreement between pooled and deconvoluted samples in both cohorts. Independent t-test performed on Ct shifts supported an insignificant difference between cohorts with p-values of 0.306 (Orf1ab), 0.147 (N), and 0.052 (S). All negative pools were correctly reported as negative. Pooled PCR testing up to five samples is a valid method for surveillance testing of students and staff in a university setting, especially when the prevalence is expected to be low.
