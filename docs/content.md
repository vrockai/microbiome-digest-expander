This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## [Surgical treatment for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a five-year single-center experience of 421 cases].
 18.01.2023, _FY Liu, Q Ji, YL Wang, JM Chen, LL Dong, WJ Ding, H Lai, CS Wang_


Objectives: To examine the short-term and mid-term effects of surgical treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in one center. Methods: The perioperative data and short-term follow-up outcomes of 421 patients with obstructive HCM who received surgical treatment at Department of Cardiac Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University from January 2017 to December 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 207 males and 214 females, aged (56.5±11.7) years (range: 19 to 78 years). Preoperative New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification included 45 cases of class Ⅱ, 328 cases in class Ⅲ, and 48 cases in class Ⅳ. Fifty-eight patients were diagnosed with latent obstructive HCM and 257 patients had moderate or more mitral regurgitation with 56 patients suffering from intrinsic mitral valve diseases. All procedures were completed by a multidisciplinary team, including professional echocardiologists involving in preoperative planning for proper miitral valve management strategies and intraoperative monitoring. A total of 338 patients underwent septal myectomy alone, and 59 patients underwent mitral valve surgery along with myectomy. A single transaortic approach was used in 355 patients, and a right atrial-atrial septal/atrial sulcus approach was used in 51 other patients. Long-handled minimally invasive surgical instruments were wsed for the procedures. Student t test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, χ2 test or Fisher exact test were used to compare the data before and after surgery. Results: The aortic cross-clamping time of septal myectomy alone was (34.3±8.5) minutes (range: 21 to 94 minutes). Eighteen patients had intraoperative adverse events and underwent immediate reoperation, including residual obstruction (10 patients), left ventricular free wall rupture (4 patients), ventricular septal perforation (3 patients), and aortic valve perforation (1 patient). Four patients died during hospitalization, and 11 patients developed complete atrioventricular block requiring permanent pacemaker implantation. After discharge, 384 (92.1%) patients received a follow-up visit with a median duration of 9 months. All follow-up patients survived with significantly improved NYHA classifications: 216 patients in class Ⅰ and 168 patients in class Ⅱ (χ2=662.73, P&lt;0.01 as compared to baseline). At 6 months after surgery, follow-up echocardiography showed that the thickness of the ventricular septum ((13.6±2.5) mm vs. (18.2±3.0) mm, t=23.51, P&lt;0.01) and the peak left ventricular outflow tract gradient ((12.0±6.3) mmHg vs. (93.4±19.8) mmHg, 1 mmHg=0.133 kPa, t=78.29, P&lt;0.01) were both significantly lower than baseline values. Conclusion: The construction of the surgical team (including echocardiography experts), proper mitral valve management strategies, identification and management of sub-mitral-valve abnormalities, and application of long-handled minimally invasive surgical instruments are important for the successful implementation of septal myectomy with satisfactory short-and medium-term outcomes.

The infant gut microbiota affects childhood health. This pioneer microbiota may be vulnerable to antibiotic exposures, but could be supported by prebiotic oligosaccharides found in breast milk and some infant formulas. We sought to characterize the effects of several exposures on the neonatal gut microbiota, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and infant/maternal antimicrobial exposures. We profiled the stool microbiota of 1023 one-month-old infants from the KOALA Birth Cohort using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We quantified 15 HMOs in breast milk from the mothers of 220 infants, using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both breastfeeding and antibiotic exposure decreased gut microbial diversity, but each was associated with contrasting shifts in microbiota composition. Other factors associated with microbiota composition included C-section, homebirth, siblings, and exposure to animals. Neither infant exposure to oral antifungals nor maternal exposure to antibiotics during pregnancy were associated with infant microbiota composition. Four distinct groups of breast milk HMO compositions were evident, corresponding to maternal Secretor status and Lewis group combinations defined by the presence/absence of certain fucosylated HMOs. However, we found the strongest evidence for microbiota associations between two non-fucosylated HMOs: 6'-sialyllactose (6'-SL) and lacto-N-hexaose (LNH), which were associated with lower and higher relative abundances of Bifidobacterium, respectively. Among 111 exclusively formula-fed infants, the GOS-supplemented formula was associated with a lower relative abundance of Clostridium perfringens. In conclusion, the gut microbiota is sensitive to some prebiotic and antibiotic exposures during early infancy and understanding their effects could inform future strategies for safeguarding a health-promoting infant gut microbiota.

## Joint Analysis of Microbial and Immune Cell Abundance in Liver Cancer Tissue Using a Gene Expression Profile Deconvolution Algorithm Combined With Foreign Read Remapping.
 16.07.2022, _D Ai, Y Xing, Q Zhang, Y Wang, X Liu, G Liu, LC Xia_

Recent transcriptomics and metagenomics studies showed that tissue-infiltrating immune cells and bacteria interact with cancer cells to shape oncogenesis. This interaction and its effects remain to be elucidated. However, it is technically difficult to co-quantify immune cells and bacteria in their respective microenvironments. To address this challenge, we herein report the development of a complete a bioinformatics pipeline, which accurately estimates the number of infiltrating immune cells using a novel Particle Swarming Optimized Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR) algorithm, and the number of infiltrating bacterial using foreign read remapping and the GRAMMy algorithm. It also performs systematic differential abundance analyses between tumor-normal pairs. We applied the pipeline to a collection of paired liver cancer tumor and normal samples, and we identified bacteria and immune cell species that were significantly different between tissues in terms of health status. Our analysis showed that this dual model of microbial and immune cell abundance had a better differentiation (84%) between healthy and diseased tissue. Caldatribacterium sp., Acidaminococcaceae sp., Planctopirus sp., Desulfobulbaceae sp.,Nocardia farcinica as well as regulatory T cells (Tregs), resting mast cells, monocytes, M2 macrophases, neutrophils were identified as significantly different (Mann Whitney Test, FDR&lt; 0.05). Our open-source software is freely available from GitHub at https://github.com/gutmicrobes/PSO-SVR.git.

## SPCIS: Standardized Plant Community with Introduced Status database.

The movement of plant species across the globe exposes native communities to new species introductions. While introductions are pervasive, two aspects of variability underlie patterns and processes of biological invasions at macroecological scales. First, only a portion of introduced species become invaders capable of substantially impacting ecosystems. Second, species that do become invasive at one location may not be invasive in others; impacts depend on invader abundance and recipient species and conditions. Accounting for these phenomena is essential to accurately understand the patterns of plant invasion and explain the idiosyncratic results reflected in the literature on biological invasions. The lack of community-level richness and the abundance of data spanning broad scales and environmental conditions have until now hindered our understanding of invasions at a macroecological scale. To address this limitation, we leveraged quantitative surveys of plant communities in the USA and integrated and harmonized nine datasets into the Standardized Plant Community with Introduced Status (SPCIS) database. The database contains 14,056 unique taxa identified within 83,391 sampling units, of which 52.6% have at least one introduced species. The SPCIS database includes comparable information on plant species occurrence, abundance, and native status across the 50 U.S. States and Puerto Rico. SPCIS can be used to answer macro-scale questions about native plant communities and interactions with invasive plants. There are no copyright restrictions on the data, and we ask the users of this dataset to cite this paper, the respective paper(s) corresponding to the dataset sampling design (all references are provided in Data S1: Metadata S1: Class II-B-2), and the references described in Data S1: Metadata S1: Class III-B-4 as applicable to the dataset being utilized.

Allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis detects the relative abundance of alleles at heterozygous loci as a proxy for cis-regulatory variation, which affects the personal transcriptome and proteome. This study describes the development and application of an ASE analysis pipeline on a unique cohort of 87 well phenotyped and RNA sequenced patients from the Maastricht Cardiomyopathy Registry with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a complex genetic disorder with a remaining gap in explained heritability. Regulatory processes for which ASE is a proxy might explain this gap. We found an overrepresentation of known DCM-associated genes among the significant results across the cohort. In addition, we were able to find genes of interest that have not been associated with DCM through conventional methods such as genome-wide association or differential gene expression studies. The pipeline offers RNA sequencing data processing, individual and population level ASE analyses as well as group comparisons and several intuitive visualizations such as Manhattan plots and protein-protein interaction networks. With this pipeline, we found evidence supporting the case that cis-regulatory variation contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity of DCM. Additionally, our results highlight that ASE analysis offers an additional layer to conventional genomic and transcriptomic analyses for candidate gene identification and biological insight.

## Expression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase increases non-polar lipid accumulation in Nannochloropsis oceanica.
 18.01.2023, _C Südfeld, A Kiyani, K Wefelmeier, RH Wijffels, MJ Barbosa, S D'Adamo_


_Glycerol, Oils, Genetic Engineering, Glycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase, Stramenopiles, Microalgae, Biomass, Phosphates_
Microalgae are considered a suitable production platform for high-value lipids and oleochemicals. Several species including Nannochloropsis oceanica produce large amounts of essential [Formula: see text]-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which are integral components of food and feed and have been associated with health-promoting effects. N. oceanica can further accumulate high contents of non-polar lipids with chemical properties that render them a potential replacement for plant oils such as palm oil. However, biomass and lipid productivities obtained with microalgae need to be improved to reach commercial feasibility. Genetic engineering can improve biomass and lipid productivities, for instance by increasing carbon flux to lipids. Here, we report the overexpression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) in N. oceanica during favorable growth conditions as a strategy to increase non-polar lipid content. Transformants overproducing either an endogenous (NoGPAT) or a heterologous (Acutodesmus obliquus GPAT) GPAT enzyme targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum had up to 42% and 51% increased non-polar lipid contents, respectively, compared to the wild type. Biomass productivities of transformant strains were not substantially impaired, resulting in lipid productivities that were increased by up to 37% and 42% for NoGPAT and AoGPAT transformants, respectively. When exposed to nutrient stress, transformants and wild type had similar lipid contents, suggesting that GPAT enzyme exerts strong flux control on lipid synthesis in N. oceanica under favorable growth conditions. NoGPAT transformants further accumulated PUFAs in non-polar lipids, reaching a total of 6.8% PUFAs per biomass, an increase of 24% relative to the wild type. Overall, our results indicate that GPAT is an interesting target for engineering of lipid metabolism in microalgae, in order to improve non-polar lipid and PUFAs accumulation in microalgae.
