 26.02.2022, _C Mekadim, HK Skalnikova, J Cizkova, V Cizkova, A Palanova, V Horak, J Mrazek_


The microbiome alterations are associated with cancer growth and may influence the immune system and response to therapy. Particularly, the gut microbiome has been recently shown to modulate response to melanoma immunotherapy. However, the role of the skin microbiome has not been well explored in the skin tumour microenvironment and the link between the gut microbiome and skin microbiome has not been investigated in melanoma progression. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine associations between dysbiosis in the skin and gut microbiome and the melanoma growth using MeLiM porcine model of melanoma progression and spontaneous regression.

The emergence and diffusion of strains of pathogenic bacteria resistant to antibiotics constitutes a real public health challenge. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) can be carried by both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, including commensal bacteria from the human microbiota, which require special monitoring in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.

Gut microbiota is a primary driver of inflammation in the colon and is linked to early colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Thus, a novel and noninvasive microbiome-based model could promote screening in patients at average risk for CRC. Nevertheless, the relevance and effectiveness of microbial biomarkers for noninvasive CRC screening remains unclear, and researchers lack the data to distinguish CRC-related gut microbiome biomarkers from those of other common gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Microbiome-based classification distinguishes patients with CRC from normal participants and excludes other CRC-relevant diseases (e.g., GI bleed, adenoma, bowel diseases, and postoperative). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 92.2%. Known associations with oral pathogenic features, benefits-generated features, and functional features of CRC were confirmed using the model. Our optimised prediction model was established using large-scale experimental population-based data and other sequence-based faecal microbial community data. This model can be used to identify the high-risk groups and has the potential to become a novel screening method for CRC biomarkers because of its low false-positive rate (FPR) and good stability. KEY POINTS: • A total of 5744 CRC and non-CRC large-scale faecal samples were sequenced, and a model was constructed for CRC discrimination on the basis of the relative abundance of taxonomic and functional features. • This model could identify high-risk groups and become a novel screening method for CRC biomarkers because of its low FPR and good stability. • The association relationship of oral pathogenic features, benefits-generated features, and functional features in CRC was confirmed by the study.

## Gut Microbiota Regulate Pancreatic Growth, Exocrine Function and Gut Hormones.
 25.02.2022, _K Girdhar, M Soto, Q Huang, L Orliaguet, C Cederquist, B Sundaresh, J Hu, M Figura, A Raisingani, EE Canfora, E Dirice, S Fujisaka, GH Goossens, EE Blaak, RN Kulkarni, CR Kahn, E Altindis_


Growing evidence indicates an important link between gut microbiota, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Alterations in exocrine pancreatic function are also widely present in patients with diabetes and obesity. To examine this interaction, C57BL/6J mice were fed either a chow diet, high-fat diet (HFD) or HFD plus oral vancomycin or metronidazole to modify the gut microbiome. HFD alone leads to a 40% increase in pancreas weight, decreased glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY levels, and increased glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide in the plasma. Quantitative proteomics identified 138 host proteins in fecal samples of these mice, of which 32 were significantly changed by HFD. The most significant of these were the pancreatic enzymes. These changes in amylase and elastase were reversed by antibiotic treatment. These alterations could be reproduced by transferring gut microbiota from donor C57BL/6J mice to germ-free. By contrast, antibiotics had no effect on pancreatic size or exocrine function in C57BL/6J mice fed a chow diet. Further, one week vancomycin administration significantly increased amylase and elastase levels in obese prediabetic men. Thus, the alterations in gut microbiota in obesity can alter pancreatic growth, exocrine function and gut endocrine function, and may contribute to the alterations observed in patients with obesity and diabetes.

Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily a respiratory infection, mounting evidence suggests that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is involved in the disease, with gut barrier dysfunction and gut microbiota alterations being related to disease severity. Whether these alterations persist and are related to long-term respiratory dysfunction remains unknown.

## Gut microbiota and BMI throughout childhood: the role of firmicutes, bacteroidetes, and short-chain fatty acid producers.
 26.02.2022, _TA Houtman, HA Eckermann, H Smidt, C de Weerth_


Childhood obesity is a risk factor for numerous health conditions. A critical factor in the etiology of obesity appears to be the gut microbiota, which is the microbial community that resides in the human gut. The ratio of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (F/B) and gut bacterial genera that produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) have been suggested to contribute to obesity. The current study investigated (1) whether differences in F/B ratio can be observed in infancy and childhood in relation to zBMI in healthy children, and (2) whether an innovative proxy measure adds evidence to a relationship between SCFA producers and the etiology of obesity. Stool samples were collected at five time points, and zBMI was assessed at eight time points throughout the first 12 years of life. Our confirmatory analyses with Bayesian multilevel models showed no relationship between the F/B ratio and zBMI. Also, a proxy measure constructed from known SCFA producers was unrelated to zBMI throughout the first 12 years of life. Exploratory analyses using multilevel and random forest models suggest that the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were independently negatively associated with zBMI from infancy through childhood, and the SCFA producing genera Subdoligranulum and Alistipes were negatively related to future BMI in childhood.

## Vedolizumab and Extraintestinal Manifestations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
 11.10.2021, _J Hanzel, C Ma, NV Casteele, R Khanna, V Jairath, BG Feagan_


_Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized, Gastrointestinal Agents, Humans, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Quality of Life, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha_
In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, inflammation is not limited to the digestive tract. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), which affect up to 50% of patients, can substantially impair quality of life. EIMs may parallel luminal disease activity or have an independent course. They most commonly involve the musculoskeletal system (e.g., peripheral or axial arthritis) and skin (e.g., erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum). Less commonly, the hepatobiliary tract (e.g., primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC]) and the eye (e.g., episcleritis, scleritis, and uveitis) are involved. Although the pathophysiology of EIMs is poorly understood, they are likely either manifestations of a primary systemic immune disease with variable expression amongst organs, or secondary phenomena to bowel inflammation. Additional pathophysiologic mechanisms may include aberrant lymphocyte homing mediated by ectopic expression of gut-specific chemokines and adhesion molecules, cross-reactivity between microbial and self-antigens, autoantibodies against epitopes shared by the intestine and extraintestinal tissues, elevated serum concentrations of cytokines, and alterations in innate immunity. Many EIMs independent of intestinal disease activity can be successfully treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. The efficacy of vedolizumab-a monoclonal antibody targeting the α4β7 integrin-for the treatment of EIMs is uncertain, but data are emerging from post hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series. Vedolizumab may be effective in treating EIMs related to luminal disease activity (e.g., type 1 peripheral arthritis and erythema nodosum) but has not shown biochemical improvement in PSC. Its postulated role in the development of de novo EIMs is heavily confounded by the high proportion of patients previously exposed to TNF antagonists; new EIMs could result from TNF antagonist treatment cessation rather than being caused by vedolizumab. A common limitation of clinical studies is the lack of multidisciplinary involvement in the diagnosis and monitoring of EIMs, which may lead to misdiagnosis and overreporting. Future studies should rigorously measure EIMs in parallel with objective measures of luminal disease activity to provide more robust data on the relative efficacy of new drugs, especially as increasing numbers of gut-selective compounds enter clinical development.

## Role of Inflammaging on the Reproductive Function and Pregnancy.
 19.01.2022, _A Zavatta, F Parisi, C Mandò, C Scaccabarozzi, VM Savasi, I Cetin_


During female lifetime and pregnancy, inflammation and cellular senescence are implicated in physiological processes, from ovulation and menstruation, to placental homeostasis and delivery. Several lifestyles, nutritional, and environmental insults, as well as long-lasting pregestational inflammatory diseases may lead to detrimental effects in promoting and sustaining a chronic excessive inflammatory response and inflammaging, which finally contribute to the decay of fertility and pregnancy outcome, with a negative effect on placental function, fetal development, and future health risk profile in the offspring. Maladaptation to pregnancy and obstetric disease may in turn increase maternal inflammaging in a feedback loop, speeding up aging processes and outbreak of chronic diseases. Maternal inflammaging may also impact, through transgenerational effects, on future adult health. Hence, efficacious interventions should be implemented by physicians and healthcare professionals involved in prevention activities to reduce the modifiable factors contributing to the inflammaging process in order to improve public health.

## Impact of antibiotics on the human microbiome and consequences for host health.
 25.02.2022, _DV Patangia, C Anthony Ryan, E Dempsey, R Paul Ross, C Stanton_


It is well established that the gut microbiota plays an important role in host health and is perturbed by several factors including antibiotics. Antibiotic-induced changes in microbial composition can have a negative impact on host health including reduced microbial diversity, changes in functional attributes of the microbiota, formation, and selection of antibiotic-resistant strains making hosts more susceptible to infection with pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile. Antibiotic resistance is a global crisis and the increased use of antibiotics over time warrants investigation into its effects on microbiota and health. In this review, we discuss the adverse effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota and thus host health, and suggest alternative approaches to antibiotic use.

## An experimental test of disease resistance function in the skin-associated bacterial communities of three tropical amphibian species.

Variation in the structure of host-associated microbial communities has been correlated with the occurrence and severity of disease in diverse host taxa, suggesting a key role of the microbiome in pathogen defense. However, whether these correlations are typically a cause or consequence of pathogen exposure remains an open question, and requires experimental approaches to disentangle. In amphibians, infection by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) alters the skin microbial community in some host species, whereas in other species, the skin microbial community appears to mediate infection dynamics. In this study, we completed experimental Bd exposures in three species of tropical frogs (Agalychnis callidryas, Dendropsophus ebraccatus, Craugastor fitzingeri) that were sympatric with Bd at the time of the study. For all three species, we identified key taxa within the skin bacterial communities that were linked to Bd infection dynamics. We also measured higher Bd infection intensities in D. ebraccatus and C. fitzingeri that were associated with higher mortality in C. fitzingeri. Our findings indicate that microbially-mediated pathogen resistance is a complex trait that can vary within and across host species, and suggest that symbiont communities that have experienced prior selection for defensive microbes may be less likely to be disturbed by pathogen exposure.

Domesticated horses live under different conditions compared with their extinct wild ancestors. While housed, medicated and kept on a restricted source of feed, the microbiota of domesticated horses is hypothesized to be altered. We assessed the fecal microbiome of 57 domestic and feral horses from different locations on three continents, observing geographical differences. A higher abundance of eukaryota (p &lt; 0.05) and viruses (p &lt; 0.05) and lower of archaea (p &lt; 0.05) were found in feral animals when compared with domestic ones. The abundance of genes coding for microbe-produced enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in feral animals regardless of the geographic origin. Differences in the fecal resistomes between both groups of animals were also noted. The domestic/captive horse microbiomes were enriched in genes conferring resistance to tetracycline, likely reflecting the use of this antibiotic in the management of these animals. Our data showed an impoverishment of the fecal microbiome in domestic horses with diet, antibiotic exposure and hygiene being likely drivers. The results offer a view of the intestinal microbiome of horses and the impact of domestication or captivity, which may uncover novel targets for modulating the microbiome of horses to enhance animal health and well-being.

## Long-term effect of epigenetic modification in plant-microbe interactions: modification of DNA methylation induced by plant growth-promoting bacteria mediates promotion process.
 25.02.2022, _C Chen, M Wang, J Zhu, Y Tang, H Zhang, Q Zhao, M Jing, Y Chen, X Xu, J Jiang, Z Shen_


Soil microbiomes are considered a cornerstone of the next green revolution, and plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are critical for microbiome engineering. However, taking plant-beneficial microorganisms from discovery to agricultural application remains challenging, as the mechanisms underlying the interactions between beneficial strains and plants in native soils are still largely unknown. Increasing numbers of studies have indicated that strains introduced to manipulate microbiomes are usually eliminated in soils, while others have reported that application of PGPB as inocula significantly improves plant growth. This contradiction suggests the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying microbe-induced growth promotion.

## Modulation of the Wheat Seed-Borne Bacterial Community by Herbaspirillum seropedicae RAM10 and Its Potential Effects for Tryptophan Metabolism in the Root Endosphere.
 11.01.2022, _P Carril, J Cruz, C di Serio, G Pieraccini, S Ait Bessai, R Tenreiro, C Cruz_


Plants and their associated microbiota share ecological and evolutionary traits that are considered to be inseparably woven. Their coexistence foresees the use of similar metabolic pathways, leading to the generation of molecules that can cross-regulate each other's metabolism and ultimately influence plant phenotype. However, the extent to which the microbiota contributes to the overall plant metabolic landscape remains largely unexplored. Due to their early presence in the seed, seed-borne endophytic bacteria can intimately colonize the plant's endosphere while conferring a series of phytobeneficial services to their host. Understanding the dynamics of these endophytic communities is a crucial step toward the formulation of microbial inoculants that can modulate the functionality of the plant-associated microbiota for improved plant fitness. In this work, wheat (Triticum aestivum) roots non-inoculated and inoculated with the bacterium Herbaspirillum seropedicae strain RAM10 were analyzed to explore the impact of inoculant-endophyte-wheat interrelationships on the regulation of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism in the endosphere environment. Root inoculation with H. seropedicae led to phylum-specific changes in the cultivable seed-borne endophytic community. This modulation shifted the metabolic potential of the community in light of its capacity to modulate the levels of key Trp-related metabolites involved in both indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis and in the kynurenine pathway. Our results support a mode of action of H. seropedicae relying on a shift in both the composition and functionality of the seed-borne endophytic community, which may govern important processes such as root growth. We finally provide a conceptual framework illustrating that interactions among roots, inoculants, and seed-borne endophytes are critical to fine-tuning the levels of IAA in the endosphere. Understanding the outcomes of these interactions is a crucial step toward the formulation of microbial inoculants based on their joint action with seed-borne endophytic communities to promote crop growth and health in a sustainable manner.

## Plant organ and sampling time point determine the taxonomic structure of microbial communities associated to apple plants in the orchard environment.
 26.02.2022, _CMO Longa, L Antonielli, E Bozza, C Sicher, I Pertot, M Perazzolli_


Plant-associated microbial communities interact with their host and are important components of the biodiversity of natural and agro-ecosystems. Scarce knowledge is available on the establishment of plant microbiota in perennial woody plants. In this work the variability in bacterial and fungal communities in aboveground organs was analysed in leaves, bark, flowers and fruits on three apple cultivars (Gala, Fuji and Golden), in order to understand changes of the microbiota community structure from orchard planting to the first year of fruit production. Our results indicate that Proteobacteria, Bacterioidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmiculites were the dominant bacterial phyla across all samples. The majority of fungal sequences were assigned to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The bacterial genera Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas, and the fungal genera Aureobasidium and Filobasidium, represented a major component of the aboveground microbiota. Different parts of the apple plant harboured a specific microbiota and the effect of plant organ on the bacterial and fungal taxonomic structure exceeded the influence of sampling time and plant genotype. This work highlights the specificity of the microbiota associated with aboveground apple organs, changes of the microbiota composition during the plant development from orchard planting to the first year of fruit production, and the negligible effects of apple cultivar.

## Major Biological Control Strategies for Plant Pathogens.
 26.02.2022, _MA Pandit, J Kumar, S Gulati, N Bhandari, P Mehta, R Katyal, CD Rawat, V Mishra, J Kaur_


Food security has become a major concern worldwide in recent years due to ever increasing population. Providing food for the growing billions without disturbing environmental balance is incessantly required in the current scenario. In view of this, sustainable modes of agricultural practices offer better promise and hence are gaining prominence recently. Moreover, these methods have taken precedence currently over chemical-based methods of pest restriction and pathogen control. Adoption of Biological Control is one such crucial technique that is currently in the forefront. Over a period of time, various biocontrol strategies have been experimented with and some have exhibited great success and promise. This review highlights the different methods of plant-pathogen control, types of plant pathogens, their modus operandi and various biocontrol approaches employing a range of microorganisms and their byproducts. The study lays emphasis on the use of upcoming methodologies like microbiome management and engineering, phage cocktails, genetically modified biocontrol agents and microbial volatilome as available strategies to sustainable agricultural practices. More importantly, a critical analysis of the various methods enumerated in the paper indicates the need to amalgamate these techniques in order to improve the degree of biocontrol offered by them.

 25.02.2022, _J Hong, U Karaoz, P de Valpine, W Fithian_


Microbiome datasets provide rich information about microbial communities. However, vast library size variations across samples present great challenges for proper statistical comparisons. To deal with these challenges, rarefaction is often used in practice as a normalization technique, although there has been debate whether rarefaction should ever be used. Conventional wisdom and previous work suggested that rarefaction should never be used in practice, arguing that rarefying microbiome data is statistically inadmissible. These discussions, however, have been confined to particular parametric models and simulation studies.

## Human Stool Preservation Impacts Taxonomic Profiles in 16S Metagenomics Studies.

Microbiotas play critical roles in human health, yet in most cases scientists lack standardized and reproducible methods from collection and preservation of samples, as well as the choice of omic analysis, up to the data processing. To date, stool sample preservation remains a source of technological bias in metagenomic sequencing, despite newly developed storage solutions. Here, we conducted a comparative study of 10 storage methods for human stool over a 14-day period of storage at fluctuating temperatures. We first compared the performance of each stabilizer with observed bacterial composition variation within the same specimen. Then, we identified the nature of the observed variations to determine which bacterial populations were more impacted by the stabilizer. We found that DNA stabilizers display various stabilizing efficacies and affect the recovered bacterial profiles thus highlighting that some solutions are more performant in preserving the true gut microbial community. Furthermore, our results showed that the bias associated with the stabilizers can be linked to the phenotypical traits of the bacterial populations present in the studied samples. Although newly developed storage solutions have improved our capacity to stabilize stool microbial content over time, they are nevertheless not devoid of biases hence requiring the implantation of standard operating procedures. Acknowledging the biases and limitations of the implemented method is key to better interpret and support true associated microbiome patterns that will then lead us towards personalized medicine, in which the microbiota profile could constitute a reliable tool for clinical practice.
