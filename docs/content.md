Research on the gut-brain axis has accelerated substantially over the course of the last years. Many reviews have outlined the important implications of understanding the relation of the gut microbiota with human brain function and behavior. One substantial drawback in integrating gut microbiome and brain data is the lack of integrative multivariate approaches that enable capturing variance in both modalities simultaneously. To address this issue, we applied a linked independent component analysis (LICA) to microbiota and brain connectivity data.We analyzed data from 58 healthy females (mean age = 21.5 years). Magnetic Resonance Imaging data were acquired using resting state functional imaging data. The assessment of gut microbial composition from feces was based on sequencing of the V4 16S rRNA gene region. We used the LICA model to simultaneously factorize the subjects' large-scale brain networks and microbiome relative abundance data into 10 independent components of spatial and abundance variation.LICA decomposition resulted in four components with non-marginal contribution of the microbiota data. The default mode network featured strongly in three components, whereas the two-lateralized fronto-parietal attention networks contributed to one component. The executive-control (with the default mode) network was associated to another component. We found that the abundance of Prevotella genus was associated with the strength of expression of all networks, whereas Bifidobacterium was associated with the default mode and frontoparietal-attention networks.We provide the first exploratory evidence for multivariate associative patterns between the gut microbiota and brain network connectivity in healthy humans considering the complexity of both systems.

We explored opportunities for personalized and predictive health care by collecting serial clinical measurements, health surveys, genomics, proteomics, autoantibodies, metabolomics, and gut microbiome data from 96 individuals who participated in a data-driven health coaching program over a 16-month period with continuous digital monitoring of activity and sleep. We generated a resource of &gt;20,000 biological samples from this study and a compendium of &gt;53 million primary data points for 558,032 distinct features. Multiomics factor analysis revealed distinct and independent molecular factors linked to obesity, diabetes, liver function, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, immunity, exercise, diet, and hormonal effects. For example, ethinyl estradiol, a common oral contraceptive, produced characteristic molecular and physiological effects, including increased levels of inflammation and impact on thyroid, cortisol levels, and pulse, that were distinct from other sources of variability observed in our study. In total, this work illustrates the value of combining deep molecular and digital monitoring of human health. A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

## A specific structure and high richness characterize intestinal microbiota of HIV-exposed seronegative individuals.
 06.12.2021, _TJ Lopera, JA Lujan, E Zurek, W Zapata, JC Hernandez, MA Toro, JF Alzate, NA Taborda, MT Rugeles, W Aguilar-Jimenez_


Intestinal microbiota facilitates food breakdown for energy metabolism and influences the immune response, maintaining mucosal homeostasis. Overall, HIV infection is associated with intestinal dysbiosis and immune activation, which has been related to seroconversion in HIV-exposed individuals. However, it is unclear whether microbiota dysbiosis is the cause or the effect of immune alterations and disease progression or if it could modulate the risk of acquiring the HIV infection. We characterize the intestinal microbiota and determine its association with immune regulation in HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (HESN), HIV-infected progressors (HIV+), and healthy control (HC) subjects. For this, feces and blood were collected. The microbiota composition of HESN showed a significantly higher alpha (p = 0.040) and beta diversity (p = 0.006) compared to HC, but no differences were found compared to HIV+. A lower Treg percentage was observed in HESN (1.77%) than HC (2.98%) and HIV+ (4.02%), with enrichment of the genus Butyrivibrio (p = 0.029) being characteristic of this profile. Moreover, we found that Megasphaera (p = 0.017) and Victivallis (p = 0.0029) also are enriched in the microbiota composition in HESN compared to HC and HIV+ subjects. Interestingly, an increase in Succinivibrio and Prevotella, and a reduction in Bacteroides genus, which is typical of HIV-infected individuals, were observed in both HESN and HIV+, compared to HC. Thus, HESNs have a microbiota profile, similar to that observed in HIV+, most likely because HESN are cohabiting with their HIV+ partners.

## Central role of intestinal epithelial glucocorticoid receptor in alcohol- and corticosterone-induced gut permeability and systemic response.
 06.12.2021, _PK Shukla, AS Meena, JF Pierre, R Rao_


Corticosterone, the stress hormone, exacerbates alcohol-associated tissue injury, but the mechanism involved is unknown. We examined the role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in corticosterone-mediated potentiation of alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction and systemic response. Hepatocyte-specific GR-deficient (GRΔHC ) and intestinal epithelial-specific GR-deficient (GRΔIEC ) mice were fed ethanol, combined with corticosterone treatment. Intestinal epithelial tight junction integrity, mucosal barrier function, microbiota dysbiosis, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, liver damage, and neuroinflammation were assessed. Corticosterone potentiated ethanol-induced epithelial tight junction disruption, mucosal permeability, and inflammatory response in GRΔHC mouse colon; these effects of ethanol and corticosterone were absent in GRΔIEC mice. Gut microbiota compositions in ethanol-fed GRΔHC and GRΔIEC mice were similar to each other. However, corticosterone treatment in ethanol-fed mice shifted the microbiota composition to distinctly different directions in GRΔHC and GRΔIEC mice. Ethanol and corticosterone synergistically elevated the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli and reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus in GRΔHC mice but not in GRΔIEC mice. In GRΔHC mice, corticosterone potentiated ethanol-induced endotoxemia and systemic inflammation, but these effects were absent in GRΔIEC mice. Interestingly, ethanol-induced liver damage and its potentiation by corticosterone were observed in GRΔHC mice but not in GRΔIEC mice. GRΔIEC mice were also resistant to ethanol- and corticosterone-induced inflammatory response in the hypothalamus. These data indicate that the intestinal epithelial GR plays a central role in alcohol- and corticosterone-induced gut barrier dysfunction, microbiota dysbiosis, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, liver damage, and neuroinflammation. This study identifies a novel target for potential therapeutic for alcohol-associated tissue injury.

## Proof-of-principle demonstration of endogenous circadian system and circadian misalignment effects on human oral microbiota.
 06.12.2021, _SL Chellappa, PA Engen, A Naqib, J Qian, N Vujovic, N Rahman, SJ Green, M Garaulet, A Keshavarzian, FAJL Scheer_


Circadian misalignment-the misalignment between the central circadian "clock" and behavioral and environmental cycles (including sleep/wake, fasting/eating, dark/light)-results in adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects. Potential underlying mechanisms for these adverse effects include alterations in the orogastrointestinal microbiota. However, it remains unknown whether human oral microbiota has endogenous circadian rhythms (i.e., independent of sleep/wake, fasting/eating, and dark/light cycles) and whether circadian misalignment influences oral microbiota community composition. Healthy young individuals [27.3 ± 2.3 years (18-35 years), 4 men and 2 women, body-mass index range: 18-28 kg/m2 ] were enrolled in a stringently controlled 14-day circadian laboratory protocol. This included a 32-h constant routine (CR) protocol (endogenous circadian baseline assessment), a forced desynchrony protocol with four 28-h "days" under ~3 lx to induce circadian misalignment, and a post-misalignment 40-h CR protocol. Microbiota assessments were performed on saliva samples collected every 4 h throughout both CR protocols. Total DNA was extracted and processed using high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. The relative abundance of specific oral microbiota populations, i.e., one of the five dominant phyla, and three of the fourteen dominant genera, exhibited significant endogenous circadian rhythms. Importantly, circadian misalignment dramatically altered the oral microbiota landscape, such that four of the five dominant phyla and eight of the fourteen dominant genera exhibited significant circadian misalignment effects. Moreover, circadian misalignment significantly affected the metagenome functional content of oral microbiota (inferred gene content analysis), as indicated by changes in specific functional pathways associated with metabolic control and immunity. Collectively, our proof-of-concept study provides evidence for endogenous circadian rhythms in human oral microbiota and show that even relatively short-term experimental circadian misalignment can dramatically affect microbiota community composition and functional pathways involved in metabolism and immune function. These proof-of-principle findings have translational relevance to individuals typically exposed to circadian misalignment, including night shift workers and frequent flyers.

## Gender Variations in the Oral Microbiomes of Elderly Patients with Initial Periodontitis.
 04.12.2021, _J Zhao, YH Zhou, YQ Zhao, Y Feng, F Yan, ZR Gao, Q Ye, Y Chen, Q Liu, L Tan, SH Zhang, J Hu, MA Dusenge, YZ Feng, Y Guo_


Periodontitis is a globally prevalent disease that imposes a functional and aesthetic burden on patients. The oral microbiome influences human health. The aim of this study was at assessing gender variation in the subgingival bacterial microbiome of elderly patients with initial periodontitis and to determine the causes of this variation. Twelve males and twenty females (range 50-68 years old) with initial periodontitis provided subgingival plaque samples. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, QIIME-based data processing, and statistical analyses were carried out using several different analytical approaches to detect differences in the oral microbiome between the two groups. Males had higher Chao1 index, observed species, and phylogenetic diversity whole tree values than females. Analysis of β-diversity indicated that the samples were reasonably divided by the gender. The linear discriminant analysis effect size showed that the most representative biomarkers were the genus Haemophilus in males, whereas the dominant bacteria in females were Campylobacter. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that predicting changes in the female oral microbiota may be related to the immune system and immune system diseases are the main factor in males. These data suggest that gender may be a differentiating factor in the microbial composition of subgingival plaques in elderly patients with initial periodontitis. These results could deepen our understanding of the role of gender in the oral microbiota present during initial periodontitis.

## Characterization of Esophageal Microbiota in Patients With Esophagitis and Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
 04.12.2021, _Z Jiang, J Wang, Z Shen, Z Zhang, S Wang_


Microbial imbalances have been well elucidated in esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, few studies address the microbiota in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophagitis (ES). We aimed to explore the association of esophageal microbiota with these patients. Esophageal tissues were obtained from healthy controls and ES and ESCC patients undergoing upper endoscopy. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was applied to analyze the microbiome. The α and β diversity differences were tested by Tukey test and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), respectively. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis was performed to assess taxonomic differences between groups. A total of 68 individuals were enrolled (control = 21, ES = 15, ESCC = 32). Microbial diversity was significantly different between the ESCC patients and healthy controls by Chao1 index, Shannon index, and PLS-DA. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria were the five dominant bacterial phyla among the three groups. Megamonas, Collinsella, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus_2 showed a significantly continuous decreasing trend from the control group to the ESCC group at the genus level. When compared with the control group, decreased Fusobacteria at phylum level and Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Curvibacter, and Blautia at genus level were detected. ESCC samples also displayed a striking reduction of Bacteroidetes, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, and Blautia in comparison with the ES patients. LEfSe analysis indicated a greater abundance of Streptococcus, Actinobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella in the ESCC group. Our study suggests a potential association between esophageal microbiome dysbiosis and ESCC and provides insights into potential screening markers for esophageal cancer.

## Gut microbiota-driven brain Aβ amyloidosis in mice requires microglia.
 03.12.2021, _HB Dodiya, HL Lutz, IQ Weigle, P Patel, J Michalkiewicz, CJ Roman-Santiago, CM Zhang, Y Liang, A Srinath, X Zhang, J Xia, M Olszewski, X Zhang, MJ Schipma, EB Chang, RE Tanzi, JA Gilbert, SS Sisodia_


We previously demonstrated that lifelong antibiotic (ABX) perturbations of the gut microbiome in male APPPS1-21 mice lead to reductions in amyloid β (Aβ) plaque pathology and altered phenotypes of plaque-associated microglia. Here, we show that a short, 7-d treatment of preweaned male mice with high-dose ABX is associated with reductions of Aβ amyloidosis, plaque-localized microglia morphologies, and Aβ-associated degenerative changes at 9 wk of age in male mice only. More importantly, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from transgenic (Tg) or WT male donors into ABX-treated male mice completely restored Aβ amyloidosis, plaque-localized microglia morphologies, and Aβ-associated degenerative changes. Transcriptomic studies revealed significant differences between vehicle versus ABX-treated male mice and FMT from Tg mice into ABX-treated mice largely restored the transcriptome profiles to that of the Tg donor animals. Finally, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor-mediated depletion of microglia in ABX-treated male mice failed to reduce cerebral Aβ amyloidosis. Thus, microglia play a critical role in driving gut microbiome-mediated alterations of cerebral Aβ deposition.

## Altered cervicovaginal microbiota in premenopausal ovarian cancer patients.
 02.12.2021, _A Morikawa, A Kawabata, K Shirahige, T Akiyama, A Okamoto, T Sutani_


Nearly three hundred thousand female patients are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the world annually, and this number shows an increasing trend. However, characteristic symptoms caused by ovarian cancer are so few that early diagnosis remains challenging, and an effective screening method has not yet been established. Here, we conducted a case-control study in Japan to analyze the association between cervicovaginal microbiome and ovarian cancer, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Analysis of DNA extracted from cervical smear samples revealed Lactobacillus-dominant and Lactobacillus-deficient, highly-diversified bacterial communities in premenopausal and postmenopausal healthy controls, respectively, as reported for vaginal microbiota previously. We found that cervicovaginal microbiota in ovarian cancer patients, regardless of their menopausal status, were frequently a diversified community and similar to those in healthy subjects at postmenopausal ages. The diverse microbiota was associated with the major histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, including serous ovarian cancer and ovarian clear cell cancer. The present study implies the potential of a cervicovaginal microbiome biomarker in screening ovarian cancer in premenopausal women.

## Social overcrowding impacts gut microbiota, promoting stress, inflammation, and dysglycemia.
 03.12.2021, _C Delaroque, M Chervy, AT Gewirtz, B Chassaing_


An array of chronic inflammatory diseases, including metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, are thought to be promoted by disturbance of the intestinal microbiota. Such diseases disproportionately impact low-income communities, which are frequently afflicted by chronic stress and increased density housing. Hence, we hypothesized that overcrowded housing might promote stress, microbiota dysbiosis, inflammation, and, consequently, metabolic diseases. We tested this hypothesis in a tractable murine model of social overcrowding (SOC), in which mice were housed at twice normal density. SOC moderately impacted behavior in some widely used assays (Open Field, Elevated Plus Maze and Light/Dark tests) and resulted in a stark increase in corticosterone levels. Such indices of stress were associated with mild chronic gut inflammation, hyperglycemia, elevations in colonic cytokines, and alterations in gut microbiota composition. All of these consequences of SOC were eliminated by broad spectrum antibiotics, while some (inflammation and hyperglycemia) were transmitted by microbiota transplantation from SOC mice to germfree mice housed at normal density. Altogether, these results suggest a central role for intestinal microbiota in driving stress, inflammation, and chronic diseases that are promoted by overcrowded housing.

Mutation occurs in the prostate cell genes, leading to abnormal prostate proliferation and ultimately cancer. Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers amongst men, and its prevalence worldwide increases relative to men's age. About 16% of the world's cancers are the result of microbes in the human body. Impaired population balance of symbiosis microbes in the human reproductive system is linked to PC development.

## Regulation of common neurological disorders by gut microbial metabolites.
 03.12.2021, _J Park, CH Kim_


The gut is connected to the CNS by immunological mediators, lymphocytes, neurotransmitters, microbes and microbial metabolites. A mounting body of evidence indicates that the microbiome exerts significant effects on immune cells and CNS cells. These effects frequently result in the suppression or exacerbation of inflammatory responses, the latter of which can lead to severe tissue damage, altered synapse formation and disrupted maintenance of the CNS. Herein, we review recent progress in research on the microbial regulation of CNS diseases with a focus on major gut microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and secondary bile acids. Pathological changes in the CNS are associated with dysbiosis and altered levels of microbial metabolites, which can further exacerbate various neurological disorders. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which these gut microbial metabolites regulate inflammatory diseases in the CNS are discussed. We highlight the similarities and differences in the impact on four major CNS diseases, i.e., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder, to identify common cellular and molecular networks governing the regulation of cellular constituents and pathogenesis in the CNS by microbial metabolites.

## The gut microbiota in retinal diseases.
 06.12.2021, _MA Bringer, PH Gabrielle, AM Bron, C Creuzot-Garcher, N Acar_


The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem that inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and consists of archaea, fungi, viruses, and bacteria, with bacteria being dominant. From birth onwards, it coevolves dynamically together with the host. The composition of the gut microbiota is under the influence of a complex interplay between both host and environmental factors. Scientific advances in the past few decades have shown that it is essential in maintaining homeostasis and tipping the balance between health and disease. In addition to its role in food digestion, the gut microbiota is implicated in regulating multiple physiological processes in the host gut mucosa and in distant organs such as the brain. Persistent imbalance between gut microbial communities, termed "dysbiosis," has been associated with several inflammatory and metabolic diseases as well as with central nervous system disorders. In this review, we present the state of the art of current knowledge on an emerging concept, the microbiota-retina axis, and the potential role of its disturbance in the development of retinopathies. We also describe several microbiota-targeting strategies that could constitute preventive and therapeutic tools for retinopathies.

## Microbe-based management for colorectal cancer.
 03.12.2021, _ZY Gao, Z Cui, YQ Yan, LJ Ning, ZH Wang, J Hong_


Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent, most lethal cancers in the world. Increasing evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiota is closely related to the pathogenesis and prognosis of CRC. The normal microbiota plays an essential role in maintaining gut barrier function and the immune microenvironment. Recent studies have identified carcinogenic bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) and Streptococcus gallolyticus (S. gallolyticus), as well as protective bacterial such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), as potential targets of CRC treatment. Gut microbiota modulation aims to restore gut dysbiosis, regulate the intestinal immune system and prevent from pathogen invasion, all of which are beneficial for CRC prevention and prognosis. The utility of probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation and dietary inventions to treat CRC makes them novel microbe-based management tools. In this review, we describe the mechanisms involved in bacteria-derived colorectal carcinogenesis and summarized novel bacteria-related therapies for CRC. In summary, we hope to facilitate clinical applications of intestinal bacteria for preventing and treating CRC.

## Novel Strategies for Inhibition of Bacterial Biofilm in Chronic Rhinosinusitis.
 02.12.2021, _A Shariati, S Vesal, A Khoshbayan, P Goudarzi, D Darban-Sarokhali, S Razavi, M Didehdar, Z Chegini_


An important role has been recently reported for bacterial biofilm in the pathophysiology of chronic diseases, such as Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS). CRS, affecting sinonasal mucosa, is a persistent inflammatory condition with a high prevalence around the world. Although the exact pathological mechanism of this disease has not been elicited yet, biofilm formation is known to lead to a more significant symptom burden and major objective clinical indicators. The high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has severely restricted the application of antibiotics in recent years. Furthermore, systemic antibiotic therapy, on top of its insufficient concentration to eradicate bacteria in the sinonasal biofilm, often causes toxicity, antibiotic resistance, and an effect on the natural microbiota, in patients. Thus, coming up with alternative therapeutic options instead of systemic antibiotic therapy is emphasized in the treatment of bacterial biofilm in CRS patients. The use of topical antibiotic therapy and antibiotic eluting sinus stents that induce higher antibiotic concentration, and decrease side effects could be helpful. Besides, recent research recognized that various natural products, nitric oxide, and bacteriophage therapy, in addition to the hindered biofilm formation, could degrade the established bacterial biofilm. However, despite these improvements, new antibacterial agents and CRS biofilm interactions are complicated and need extensive research. Finally, most studies were performed in vitro, and more preclinical animal models and human studies are required to confirm the collected data. The present review is specifically discussing potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of bacterial biofilm in CRS patients.
