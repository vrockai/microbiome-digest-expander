This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

The gut is the richest ecosystem of microbes in the human body and has great influence on our health. Despite many efforts, the set of microbes inhabiting this environment is not fully known, limiting our ability to identify microbial content and to research it. In this work, we combine new microbial metagenomic assembled genomes from 51,052 samples, with previously published genomes to produce a curated set of 241,118 genomes. Based on this set, we procure a new and improved human gut microbiome reference set of 3594 high quality species genomes, which successfully matches 83.65% validation samples' reads. This improved reference set contains 310 novel species, including one that exists in 19% of validation samples. Overall, this study provides a gut microbial genome reference set that can serve as a valuable resource for further research.

## Bacteria related to tick-borne pathogen assemblages in Ornithodoros cf. hasei (Acari: Argasidae) and blood of the wild mammal hosts in the Orinoquia region, Colombia.

Interest in research on soft ticks has increased in recent decades, leading to valuable insight into their role as disease vectors. The use of metagenomics-based analyses have helped to elucidate ecological factors involved in pathogen, vector, and host dynamics. To understand the main bacterial assemblages present in Ornithodoros cf. hasei and its mammalian hosts, 84 ticks and 13 blood samples from bat hosts (Chiroptera) were selected, and the 16S rRNA gene V4 region was sequenced in five pools (each one related to each host-tick pairing). Bacterial taxonomic assignment analyses were performed by comparing operational taxonomic units (OTUs) shared between ticks and their host blood. This analysis showed the presence of Proteobacteria (38.8%), Enterobacteriaceae (25%), Firmicutes (12.3%), and Actinobacteria (10.9%) within blood samples, and Rickettsiaceae (39%), Firmicutes (25%), Actinobacteria (13.1%), and Proteobacteria (9%) within ticks. Species related to potentially pathogenic genera were detected in ticks, such as Borrelia sp., Bartonella tamiae, Ehrlichia sp. and Rickettsia-like endosymbiont, and the presence of these organisms was found in all analyzed bat species (Cynomops planirostris, Molossus pretiosus, Noctilio albiventris), and O. cf. hasei. About 41-48.6% of bacterial OTUs (genera and species) were shared between ticks and the blood of bat hosts. Targeted metagenomic screening techniques allowed the detection of tick-associated pathogens for O. cf. hasei and small mammals for the first time, enabling future research on many of these pathogens.

## Antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis and autoimmune disease: A systematic review of preclinical studies.
 13.07.2022, _MM Gobbo, MB Bomfim, WY Alves, KC Oliveira, PP Corsetti, LA de Almeida_


Antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis is believed to be associated with the onset and development of autoimmune diseases. To evaluate microbiota's variations triggered by antibiotic therapy and its outcomes on autoimmune diseases, preclinical studies regarding these subjects were included in this review. The studies were selected on PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science from 2011 to 2021 by three researchers that extracted study data and risk of bias, which were verified by a further 3 independent researchers. The team assessed the strength of evidence across studies. Of the eligible studies, 17 showed an improvement of the studied disease after antibiotic therapy and 10 had a negative effect on the course of the condition. The ameliorating factors of the studied diseases were mostly seen when using an antibiotic cocktail. Male animals had a good outcome after therapy and, for all genders, the increase in IL-10 and Treg cells was often shown to ameliorate disease after the antibiotic intervention. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes appeared altered after the antibiotic intervention, leading to amelioration or worsening of the condition depending on the autoimmune disease. We identified that the number of autoimmune conditions approached leads to specific conclusions regarding the interventions, making it difficult to achieve an overall conclusion. Overall, even though pre-clinical studies must be translated to the human model, the studied aspects of gender, age, lineage and disease model substantially impact the outcomes that make for many intricacies that were not-established in the study of antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis and autoimmunity.

Consumption of fermented foods has grown worldwide due to the purported health benefits. It is thus critical to understand fermented foods microbiome that mainly influences the quality and safety of these foods. This study identified bacterial communities, including functional profiles of probiotics and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), in pickled vegetables commonly consumed in the Middle Eastern, African, and Asian sub-continent regions. Eighteen samples from six pickled vegetables were collected from local markets in Saudi Arabia and analyzed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Statistical analyses revealed significant distance and separate clustering of bacterial communities among the different pickle types. Species of Levilactobacillus namurensis, Lentilactobacillus buchneri, Lentilactobacillus parafarraginis, Lactiplantibacillus pentosus, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Leuconostoc carnosum, Weissella confuse were found in a range of dominance in most of the samples. Binning revealed 33 high-quality, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 4 MAGs representing putatively novel species of Lactobacillus, Alcanivorax, and Dichelobacter. Moreover, 285 ARGs and variants produce resistance against 20 classes of antibiotics were retrieved, mostly from Enterobacteriaceae contigs. The metagenomes harbored relatively high abundances of carbohydrate fermentation enzymes, as well as metabolic pathways for amino acid metabolism, cofactors and vitamins biosynthesis. Overall, by providing a comprehensive overview of bacterial communities and probiotic bacteria in pickled vegetables, the results suggest the need for more hygienic processing to avoid Enterobacteriaceae contamination and ARG spread.
