## Altered gut microbiota correlated with systemic inflammation in children with Kawasaki disease.
 06.09.2020, _J Chen, Y Yue, L Wang, Z Deng, Y Yuan, M Zhao, Z Yuan, C Tan, Y Cao_


Kawasaki disease (KD) is a multi-systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology that occurs mainly in children, and the disturbance of gut microbiota is generally believed to cause a hyperimmune reaction triggering KD. The aim of the study was to investigate the alterations in the fecal microbiota and assess its relationship with systemic inflammation. Totally 30 KD children were enrolled and followed up for 6 months, with another group of 30 age- and sex-matched healthy children as controls. Phylotype profiles of fecal microbial communities were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Serum inflammatory markers were detected by flow cytometer. We showed that KD children exhibited a significant reduction in fecal microbial diversity in the acute phase compared with the healthy controls. Enterococcus, Acinetobacter, Helicobacter, Lactococcus, Staphylococcus and Butyricimonas in acute KD children were significantly higher than the healthy children. Levels of systemic inflammation biomarkers, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and INF-γ, were significantly elevated in the acute KD children. Altered microbiota genera Enterococcus and Helicobacter abundances were shown to be correlated positively with IL-6, which were never previously reported in KD. This study suggested that gut microbiota alteration is closely associated with systemic inflammation, which provides a new perspective on the etiology and pathogenesis of KD.

## Lactose-reduced infant formula with added corn syrup solids is associated with a distinct gut microbiota in Hispanic infants.
 07.09.2020, _RB Jones, PK Berger, JF Plows, TL Alderete, J Millstein, J Fogel, SN Iablokov, DA Rodionov, AL Osterman, L Bode, MI Goran_


Infant formula feeding, compared with human milk, has been associated with development of a distinct infant gut microbiome, but no previous study has examined effects of formula with added sugars. This work examined differences in gut microbiota among 91 Hispanic infants who consumed human milk [at breast (BB) vs. pumped in bottle (BP)] and 2 kinds of infant formula [(traditional lactose-based (TF) vs. lactose-reduced with added sugar (ASF)]. At 1 and 6 months, infant stool was collected to characterize gut microbiota. At 6 months, mothers completed 24-hour dietary recalls and questionnaires to determine infant consumption of human milk (BB vs. BP) or formula (TF vs. ASF). Linear regression models were used to determine associations of milk consumption type and microbial features at 6 months. Infants in the formula groups exhibited a significantly more 'mature' microbiome than infants in the human milk groups with the most pronounced differences observed between the ASF vs. BB groups. In the ASF group, we observed reduced log-normalized abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae (TF-BB Mean Difference = -0.71, ASF-BB Mean Difference = -1.10), and increased abundance of Lachnospiraceae (TF-BB Mean Difference = +0.89, ASF-BB Mean Difference = +1.20). We also observed a higher Community Phenotype Index of propionate, most likely produced by Lachnospiraceae, in the ASF group (TF-BB Mean Difference = +0.27, ASF-BB Mean Difference = +0.36). This study provides the first evidence that consumption of infant formula with added sugar may have a stronger association than birth delivery mode, infant caloric intake, and maternal BMI on the infant's microbiome at 6 months of age.

## Microplastics negatively affect soil fauna but stimulate microbial activity: insights from a field-based microplastic addition experiment.
 02.09.2020, _D Lin, G Yang, P Dou, S Qian, L Zhao, Y Yang, N Fanin_


Microplastics are recognized as an emerging contaminant worldwide. Although microplastics have been shown to strongly affect organisms in aquatic environments, less is known about whether and how microplastics can affect different taxa within a soil community, and it is unclear whether these effects can cascade through soil food webs. By conducting a microplastic manipulation experiment, i.e. adding low-density polyethylene fragments in the field, we found that microplastic addition significantly affected the composition and abundance of microarthropod and nematode communities. Contrary to soil fauna, we found only small effects of microplastics on the biomass and structure of soil microbial communities. Nevertheless, structural equation modelling revealed that the effects of microplastics strongly cascade through the soil food webs, leading to the modification of microbial functioning with further potential consequences on soil carbon and nutrient cycling. Our results highlight that taking into account the effects of microplastics at different trophic levels is important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ecological impacts of microplastic pollution on soil functioning.

## Shared bicycle microbial community: a potential antibiotic-resistant bacteria warehouse.
 05.09.2020, _Y Wu, J Xie, J Li, J Zhao, S Qiao, Y Li, J Zeng_


Shared bicycle is an emerging form of public transportation in China and around the world. However, the bacterial community and drug-resistant microbiome on these bicycles have not been reported. Samples from 10 shared bicycles were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Nine samples collected from 90 shared bicycles in three different kinds of location (hospital, metro station, shopping mall) were used for full-length 16S rDNA gene analysis to figure out the bacterial composition of the shared bicycle. Samples from 32 shared bicycles were used to investigate culturable drug-resistant bacteria of the shared bicycle bacterial community. It was found that in the shared bicycle bacterial community, Bacillus was the most abundant bacteria, as determined by both SEM observation and full-length 16S rDNA gene analysis. For the analysis of drug-resistant bacteria, Bacillus showed the strongest drug resist ability. Moreover, the resistances to bacitracin and sulfamethoxazole were the most common among all types of bacteria. Our study provides an important reference for the prevention of the potential spread of drug-resistant bacteria through shared bicycles.

## Microbial carrying capacity and carbon biomass of plastic marine debris.
 03.09.2020, _S Zhao, ER Zettler, LA Amaral-Zettler, TJ Mincer_


Trillions of plastic debris fragments are floating at sea, presenting a substantial surface area for microbial colonization. Numerous cultivation-independent surveys have characterized plastic-associated microbial biofilms, however, quantitative studies addressing microbial carbon biomass are lacking. Our confocal laser scanning microscopy data show that early biofilm development on polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and glass substrates displayed variable cell size, abundance, and carbon biomass, whereas these parameters stabilized in mature biofilms. Unexpectedly, plastic substrates presented lower volume proportions of photosynthetic cells after 8 weeks, compared to glass. Early biofilms displayed the highest proportions of diatoms, which could influence the vertical transport of plastic debris. In total, conservative estimates suggest 2.1 × 1021 to 3.4 × 1021 cells, corresponding to about 1% of the microbial cells in the ocean surface microlayer (1.5 × 103 to 1.1 × 104 tons of carbon biomass), inhabit plastic debris globally. As an unnatural addition to sea surface waters, the large quantity of cells and biomass carried by plastic debris has the potential to impact biodiversity, autochthonous ecological functions, and biogeochemical cycles within the ocean.
