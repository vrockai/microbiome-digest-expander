The gut microbiome (GM) modulates body weight/composition and gastrointestinal functioning; therefore, approaches targeting resident gut microbes have attracted considerable interest. Intermittent fasting (IF) and protein pacing (P) regimens are effective in facilitating weight loss (WL) and enhancing body composition. However, the interrelationships between IF- and P-induced WL and the GM are unknown. The current randomized controlled study describes distinct fecal microbial and plasma metabolomic signatures between combined IF-P (n = 21) versus a heart-healthy, calorie-restricted (CR, n = 20) diet matched for overall energy intake in free-living human participants (women = 27; men = 14) with overweight/obesity for 8 weeks. Gut symptomatology improves and abundance of Christensenellaceae microbes and circulating cytokines and amino acid metabolites favoring fat oxidation increase with IF-P (p &lt; 0.05), whereas metabolites associated with a longevity-related metabolic pathway increase with CR (p &lt; 0.05). Differences indicate GM and metabolomic factors play a role in WL maintenance and body composition. This novel work provides insight into the GM and metabolomic profile of participants following an IF-P or CR diet and highlights important differences in microbial assembly associated with WL and body composition responsiveness. These data may inform future GM-focused precision nutrition recommendations using larger sample sizes of longer duration. Trial registration, March 6, 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT04327141), based on a previous randomized intervention trial.

Environmental pollutants from different chemical families may reach the gut microbiome, where they can be metabolized and transformed. However, how our gut symbionts respond to the exposure to environmental pollution is still underexplored. In this observational, cohort study, we aim to investigate the influence of environmental pollution on the gut microbiome composition and potential activity by shotgun metagenomics. We select as a case study a population living in a highly polluted area in Campania region (Southern Italy), proposed as an ideal field for exposomic studies and we compare the fecal microbiome of 359 subjects living in areas with high, medium and low environmental pollution. We highlight changes in gut microbiome composition and functionality that were driven by pollution exposure. Subjects from highly polluted areas show higher blood concentrations of dioxin and heavy metals, as well as an increase in microbial genes related to degradation and/or resistance to these molecules. Here we demonstrate the dramatic effect that environmental xenobiotics have on gut microbial communities, shaping their composition and boosting the selection of strains with degrading capacity. The gut microbiome can be considered as a pivotal player in the environment-health interaction that may contribute to detoxifying toxic compounds and should be taken into account when developing risk assessment models. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT05976126.

## Porphyromonas gingivalis, a bridge between oral health and immune evasion in gastric cancer.
 30.05.2024, _M Muñoz-Medel, MP Pinto, L Goralsky, M Cáceres, F Villarroel-Espíndola, P Manque, A Pinto, B Garcia-Bloj, T de Mayo, JA Godoy, M Garrido, IN Retamal_


Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) is a gram-negative oral pathogen associated with chronic periodontitis. Previous studies have linked poor oral health and periodontitis with oral cancer. Severe cases of periodontal disease can result in advanced periodontitis, leading to tissue degradation, tooth loss, and may also correlate with higher gastric cancer (GC) risk. In fact, tooth loss is associated with an elevated risk of cancer. However, the clinical evidence for this association remains inconclusive. Periodontitis is also characterized by chronic inflammation and upregulation of members of the Programmed Death 1/PD1 Ligand 1 (PD1/PDL1) axis that leads to an immunosuppressive state. Given that chronic inflammation and immunosuppression are conditions that facilitate cancer progression and carcinogenesis, we hypothesize that oral P. gingivalis and/or its virulence factors serve as a mechanistic link between oral health and gastric carcinogenesis/GC progression. We also discuss the potential impact of P. gingivalis' virulence factors (gingipains, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and fimbriae) on inflammation and the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in GC which are part of the current standard of care for advanced stage patients.

## Integrating uterine microbiome and metabolome to advance the understanding of the uterine environment in dairy cows with metritis.
 30.05.2024, _S Casaro, JG Prim, TD Gonzalez, F Cunha, RS Bisinotto, RC Chebel, JEP Santos, CD Nelson, SJ Jeon, RC Bicalho, JP Driver, KN Galvão_


Metritis is a prevalent uterine disease that affects the welfare, fertility, and survival of dairy cows. The uterine microbiome from cows that develop metritis and those that remain healthy do not differ from calving until 2 days postpartum, after which there is a dysbiosis of the uterine microbiome characterized by a shift towards opportunistic pathogens such as Fusobacteriota and Bacteroidota. Whether these opportunistic pathogens proliferate and overtake the uterine commensals could be determined by the type of substrates present in the uterus. The objective of this study was to integrate uterine microbiome and metabolome data to advance the understanding of the uterine environment in dairy cows that develop metritis. Holstein cows (n = 104) had uterine fluid collected at calving and at the day of metritis diagnosis. Cows with metritis (n = 52) were paired with cows without metritis (n = 52) based on days after calving. First, the uterine microbiome and metabolome were evaluated individually, and then integrated using network analyses.

Dairy buffaloes are typically fed a high-forage, low-quality diet with high fiber. These conditions result in an inherent energy and protein inefficiency. In order to make full and rational use of feed resources and improve the production level and breeding efficiency of dairy buffaloes, the effects of various roughages on nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation parameters, and microorganisms in dairy buffaloes were studied in this experiment. Three ternary hybrid buffaloes, with an average body weight of 365 ± 22.1 kg, were selected and fitted with permanent rumen fistulas. They were fed six different diets, each consisting of 1 kg concentrate supplement and one of six types of roughage, including alfalfa hay (A diet), oat hay (O diet), whole corn silage (W diet), king grass (K diet), sugarcane shoot silage (S diet), and rice straw hay (R diet) according to an incomplete Latin square design of 3 × 6, respectively. The pre-feeding period of each period was 12 d. From day 13 to 15 was the official experimental period. During the prefeeding period, free feed intake for each roughage was determined, and during the experiment, the roughage was fed at 90% of the voluntary feed intake. Digestion and metabolism tests were carried out using the total manure collection method to determine the feed intake and fecal output of each buffalo, and to collect feed and fecal samples for chemical analysis. On day 15, rumen fluid samples were collected two hours after morning feeding to determine rumen fermentation parameters and bacterial 16 S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was performed. The results showed that DM and OM digestibility were greatest for the W diet and lowest for the S diet. The rumen pH of the O diet was significantly greater than that of the W diet. The concentration of rumen fluid NH3-N (mg/dL) increased with increased CP content. The concentration of total volatile fatty acids (mmol/L) in the rumen decreased with increased NDF content but increased with increased NFC content. The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Spirochaetes were 57.03-74.84%, 14.29-21.86%, and 0.44-1.43% in the different quality roughage groups. Bacteroidetes were mainly Prevotellaceae1 and Rikenellaceae RC_gut_group with relative abundances of 30.17-45.75% and 3.23-7.82%. The relative abundance of Patescibacteria and Spirochaetes decreased with increasing roughage quality. These results provide a theoretical and practical basis for evaluating the nutritional value of dairy buffalo feed, utilizing feed resources, matching rations, feeding scientifically, and protecting animal health.

The gut microbiota and their hosts profoundly affect each other's physiology and evolution. Identifying host-selected traits is crucial to understanding the processes that govern the evolving interactions between animals and symbiotic microbes. Current experimental approaches mainly focus on the model bacteria, like hypermutating Escherichia coli or the evolutionary changes of wild stains by host transmissions. A method called atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) may overcome the bottleneck of low spontaneous mutation rates while maintaining mild conditions for the gut bacteria.

Various animal taxa have specialized to living with social hosts. Depending on their level of specialization, these symbiotic animals are characterized by distinct behavioural, chemical, and morphological traits that enable close heterospecific interactions. Despite its functional importance, our understanding of the feeding ecology of animals living with social hosts remains limited. We examined how host specialization of silverfish co-habiting with ants affects several components of their feeding ecology. We combined stable isotope profiling, feeding assays, phylogenetic reconstruction, and microbial community characterization of the Neoasterolepisma silverfish genus and a wider nicoletiid and lepismatid silverfish panel where divergent myrmecophilous lifestyles are observed.

## Temperature-dependent differences in mouse gut motility are mediated by stress.
 28.05.2024, _A Han, C Hudson-Paz, BG Robinson, L Becker, A Jacobson, JA Kaltschmidt, JL Garrison, AS Bhatt, DM Monack_


Researchers have advocated elevating mouse housing temperatures from the conventional ~22 °C to the mouse thermoneutral point of 30 °C to enhance translational research. However, the impact of environmental temperature on mouse gastrointestinal physiology remains largely unexplored. Here we show that mice raised at 22 °C exhibit whole gut transit speed nearly twice as fast as those raised at 30 °C, primarily driven by a threefold increase in colon transit speed. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition differs between the two temperatures but does not dictate temperature-dependent differences in gut motility. Notably, increased stress signals from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at 22 °C have a pivotal role in mediating temperature-dependent differences in gut motility. Pharmacological and genetic depletion of the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone slows gut motility in stressed 22 °C mice but has no comparable effect in relatively unstressed 30 °C mice. In conclusion, our findings highlight that colder mouse facility temperatures significantly increase gut motility through hormonal stress pathways.

## Evaluation of microbiota-induced changes in biochemical, sensory properties and volatile profile of kombucha produced by reformed microbial community.
 30.05.2024, _H Kilmanoglu, A Yigit Cinar, MZ Durak_


Kombucha is a traditional beverage produced by a living culture known as SCOBY or "symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast". Culture-dependent production is essential for stable kombucha fermentation. The aim of this study was to design a microbial community and to determine the effect of that community on the flavor and chemical properties of kombucha. The fermentations were carried out using combinations of selected species including Pichia kudriavzevii, Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Dekkera bruxellensis, Komagataeibacter saccharivorans, Komagataeibacter xylinus, and Acetobacter papayae, which were previously isolated from kombucha. The effects of monocultures and cocultures on fermentation were investigated. The highest acetic acid producer was A. papayae, which has strong antioxidant properties. In the monoculture and coculture fermentations, aldehydes, acids, and esters were generally observed at the end of fermentation. This study confirms that microbiota reconstruction is a viable approach for achieving the production of kombucha with increased bioactive constituents and consumer acceptance.

## Microbial polyphenol metabolism is part of the thawing permafrost carbon cycle.

With rising global temperatures, permafrost carbon stores are vulnerable to microbial degradation. The enzyme latch theory states that polyphenols should accumulate in saturated peatlands due to diminished phenol oxidase activity, inhibiting resident microbes and promoting carbon stabilization. Pairing microbiome and geochemical measurements along a permafrost thaw-induced saturation gradient in Stordalen Mire, a model Arctic peatland, we confirmed a negative relationship between phenol oxidase expression and saturation but failed to support other trends predicted by the enzyme latch. To inventory alternative polyphenol removal strategies, we built CAMPER, a gene annotation tool leveraging polyphenol enzyme knowledge gleaned across microbial ecosystems. Applying CAMPER to genome-resolved metatranscriptomes, we identified genes for diverse polyphenol-active enzymes expressed by various microbial lineages under a range of redox conditions. This shifts the paradigm that polyphenols stabilize carbon in saturated soils and highlights the need to consider both oxic and anoxic polyphenol metabolisms to understand carbon cycling in changing ecosystems.

Biological nitrogen fixation is a fundamental process sustaining all life on earth. While distribution and diversity of N2-fixing soil microbes have been investigated by numerous PCR amplicon sequencing of nitrogenase genes, their comprehensive understanding has been hindered by lack of de facto standard protocols for amplicon surveys and possible PCR biases. Here, by fully leveraging the planetary collections of soil shotgun metagenomes along with recently expanded culture collections, we evaluated the global distribution and diversity of terrestrial diazotrophic microbiome.

Antibiotics and microplastics are two major aquatic pollutants that have been associated to antibiotic resistance selection in the environment and are considered a risk to human health. However, little is known about the interaction of these pollutants at environmental concentrations and the response of the microbial communities in the plastisphere to sub-lethal antibiotic pollution. Here, we describe the bacterial dynamics underlying this response in surface water bacteria at the community, resistome and mobilome level using a combination of methods (next-generation sequencing and qPCR), sequencing targets (16S rRNA gene, pre-clinical and clinical class 1 integron cassettes and metagenomes), technologies (short and long read sequencing), and assembly approaches (non-assembled reads, genome assembly, bacteriophage and plasmid assembly).

## Exploring potential polysaccharide utilization loci involved in the degradation of typical marine seaweed polysaccharides by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
 28.05.2024, _B Yu, Z Lu, S Zhong, KL Cheong_


Research on the mechanism of marine polysaccharide utilization by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron has drawn substantial attention in recent years. Derived from marine algae, the marine algae polysaccharides could serve as prebiotics to facilitate intestinal microecological balance and alleviate colonic diseases. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, considered the most efficient degrader of polysaccharides, relates to its capacity to degrade an extensive spectrum of complex polysaccharides. Polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), a specialized organization of a collection of genes-encoded enzymes engaged in the breakdown and utilization of polysaccharides, make it possible for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to metabolize various polysaccharides. However, there is still a paucity of comprehensive studies on the procedure of polysaccharide degradation by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.

Recent studies have reported the identity and functions of key anaerobes involved in the degradation of organic matter (OM) in deep (&gt; 1000 m) sulfidic marine habitats. However, due to the lack of available isolates, detailed investigation of their physiology has been precluded. In this study, we cultivated and characterized the ecophysiology of a wide range of novel anaerobes potentially involved in OM degradation in deep (2000 m depth) sulfidic waters of the Black Sea.
