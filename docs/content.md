Bacterial symbionts bring a wealth of functions to the associations they participate in, but by doing so, they endanger the genes and genomes underlying these abilities. When bacterial symbionts become obligately associated with their hosts, their genomes are thought to decay towards an organelle-like fate due to decreased homologous recombination and inefficient selection. However, numerous associations exist that counter these expectations, especially in marine environments, possibly due to ongoing horizontal gene flow. Despite extensive theoretical treatment, no empirical study thus far has connected these underlying population genetic processes with long-term evolutionary outcomes. By sampling marine chemosynthetic bacterial-bivalve endosymbioses that range from primarily vertical to strictly horizontal transmission, we tested this canonical theory. We found that transmission mode strongly predicts homologous recombination rates, and that exceedingly low recombination rates are associated with moderate genome degradation in the marine symbionts with nearly strict vertical transmission. Nonetheless, even the most degraded marine endosymbiont genomes are occasionally horizontally transmitted and are much larger than their terrestrial insect symbiont counterparts. Therefore, horizontal transmission and recombination enable efficient natural selection to maintain intermediate symbiont genome sizes and substantial functional genetic variation.

## Gut Microbiota and Dysbiosis in Alzheimer's Disease: Implications for Pathogenesis and Treatment.
 23.08.2020, _S Liu, J Gao, M Zhu, K Liu, HL Zhang_


Understanding how gut flora influences gut-brain communications has been the subject of significant research over the past decade. The broadening of the term "microbiota-gut-brain axis" from "gut-brain axis" underscores a bidirectional communication system between the gut and the brain. The microbiota-gut-brain axis involves metabolic, endocrine, neural, and immune pathways which are crucial for the maintenance of brain homeostasis. Alterations in the composition of gut microbiota are associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. Although a causal relationship between gut dysbiosis and neural dysfunction remains elusive, emerging evidence indicates that gut dysbiosis may promote amyloid-beta aggregation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Illustration of the mechanisms underlying the regulation by gut microbiota may pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for AD. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of gut microbiota and their dysregulation in the pathogenesis of AD. Novel insights into the modification of gut microbiota composition as a preventive or therapeutic approach for AD are highlighted.

## Sustaining the growth of Pinaceae trees under nutrient-limited edaphic conditions via plant-beneficial bacteria.
 26.08.2020, _A Puri, KP Padda, CP Chanway_


Lodgepole pine, a prominent Pinaceae tree species native to western North America, is well-known for its ability to thrive in highly disturbed and degraded areas. One such area is the Sub-Boreal Pine-Spruce xeric-cold (SBPSxc) region in British Columbia, Canada, which is characterized by weakly-developed, parched soils that lack an organic forest floor and essential plant-available nutrients. We hypothesized that plant growth-promoting bacteria could play a significant role in sustaining the growth of lodgepole pine trees in the SBPSxc region. Testing this hypothesis, we evaluated plant growth-promoting abilities of six endophytic bacterial strains previously isolated from lodgepole pine trees growing in this region. These bacterial strains significantly enhanced the length and biomass of their natural host (lodgepole pine) as well as a foreign host (hybrid white spruce) in a 540-day long greenhouse trial. This growth stimulation could be linked to the diverse plant growth-promoting (PGP) abilities detected in these strains using in vitro assays for inorganic/organic phosphate-solubilization, siderophore production IAA production, ACC deaminase activity, lytic enzymes (chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, protease, and cellulase) activity, ammonia production and catalase activity. ACC deaminase activity was also detected in vivo for all strains using ethylene-sensitive plants-canola and tomato. Notably, strains belonging to the Burkholderiaceae family (HP-S1r, LP-R1r and LP-R2r) showed the greatest potential in all PGP assays and enhanced pine and spruce seedling length and biomass by up to 1.5-fold and 4-fold, respectively. Therefore, such bacterial strains with multifarious PGP abilities could be crucial for survival and growth of lodgepole pine trees in the SBPSxc region and could potentially be utilized as bioinoculant for Pinaceae trees in highly disturbed and nutrient-poor ecosystems.

## Soil properties, bacterial and fungal community compositions and the key factors after 5-year continuous monocropping of three minor crops.
 27.08.2020, _P Yang, Y Luo, Y Gao, X Gao, J Gao, P Wang, B Feng_


Minor grain crops are widely cultivated in northwest China and played important roles in local economic. Soil microbes play a central role in ecological function and biological stability and related to soil quality. In order to uncover the soil microbial composition differences and the factors under 5-year continuous monocropping of three minor crops (Proso millet, Common bean and Common buckwheat) in Guan-Zhong Plain, six soil nutrimental parameters, soil pH, soil moisture content, and four soil enzyme activities were analyzed and soil microbial composition were sequenced. The results showed that after 5-years of continuous monocropping, different cover crops influenced most of soil physicochemical properties, expect soil moisture content (P &lt; 0.05), the available nutrients were significant higher in proso millet soil, and the pH was significantly higher in common buckwheat soil. soil ALP, catalase and urease activities were significantly different between soils (P&lt; 0.01), in which soil catalase activities were significantly lower and soil ALP and urease activities were significantly higher than that of proso millet and common buckwheat. A total of 171439 sequences, 9468 OTUs and 29 phylum for bacteria, 128920 sequences, 544 OTUs and 27 phylum for fungi were obtained. In addition, no significantly difference obtained in diversity and richness between soils (P &lt; 0.05). According to relative abundance, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria were the dominant bacterial phylum in all samples, moreover, the relative abundance of Caldiserica was significantly different between soils (P &lt; 0.05). Ascomycota (79.04%-90.21%) was dominant phylum in fungal community and phylum Phragmoplastophyta (P &lt; 0.01) and Glomeromycota (P &lt; 0.05) were significantly different between soils. Redundancy analysis indicated that available nutrients Nitrogen and Potassium are the strongest predictors in both bacterial and fungal community. In conclusion, different cover crops influenced soil nutrient properties, soil pH and soil microbial composition, and continuous monocropping decreased soil fertility condition. Moreover, Common bean and Common buckwheat were more sensitive to monocropping treatment.

## Bacteria and Archaea Communities in Cerrado Natural Pond Sediments.
 23.08.2020, _R Silveira, MRSS Silva, T de Roure Bandeira de Mello, EACC Alvim, NCS Marques, RH Kruger, MM da Cunha Bustamante_


Natural ponds in the Brazilian Cerrado harbor high biodiversity but are still poorly studied, especially their microbial assemblage. The characterization of the microbial community in aquatic environments is fundamental for understanding its functioning, particularly under the increasing pressure posed by land conversion and climate change. Here, we aim to characterize the structure (abundance, richness, and diversity) and composition of the Bacteria and Archaea in the sediment of two natural ponds belonging to different basins that primarily differ in size and depth in the Cerrado. Sediment samples were collected in the dry and rainy seasons and the transition periods between both. The structure and composition of Bacteria and Archaea were assessed by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. We identified 45 bacterial and four archaeal groups. Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria dominated the bacterial community, while Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota dominated the archaeal community. Seasonal fluctuations in the relative abundance of microbial taxa were observed, but pond characteristics were more determinant to community composition differences. Microbial communities are highly diverse, and local variability could partially explain the microbial structure's main differences. Functional predictions based in 16S rRNA gene accessed with Tax4Fun indicated an enriched abundance of predicted methane metabolism in the deeper pond, where higher abundance of methanogenic archaea Methanocella, Methanosaeta, and Methanomicrobiaceae was detected. Our dataset encompasses the more comprehensive survey of prokaryotic microbes in Cerrado's aquatic environments. Here, we present basic and essential information about composition and diversity, for initial insights into the ecology of Bacteria and Archaea in these environments.
