Isometric training is used in sport, conventional physical activity and rehabilitation. Understandably, there is a great deal of research related to its effect on performance. It is known that the length of the muscle at the moment of contraction is a determinant of strength levels. In the literature we find research on isometric training in short muscle lengths, although it has not been studied in maximally shortened positions or the acute effects that occur after its application. Ballistic stretching (BS) is also popular in sport. Their execution involves actively reaching maximally shortened muscle positions. So far, isometric training has not been compared with protocols involving ballistic stretching. Considering the above, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of BS and voluntary isometric contraction at maximal shortening (VICAMS) on range of motion, strength and vertical jump.

## Legume-supplemented feed for children hospitalised with severe malnutrition: a phase II trial.

Children hospitalised with severe malnutrition have high mortality and readmission rates post-discharge. Current milk-based formulations target restoring ponderal growth but not the modification of gut barrier integrity or microbiome which increases the risk of gram-negative sepsis and poor outcomes. We propose that legume-based feeds rich in fermentable carbohydrates will promote better gut health and improve overall outcomes. We conducted an open-label phase II trial at Mbale and Soroti Regional Referral Hospitals, Uganda, involving 160 children aged 6 months to 5 years with severe malnutrition (mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt; 11·5 cm and/or nutritional oedema). Children were randomised to a lactose-free, chickpea-enriched legume paste feed (LF) (n 80) v. WHO standard F75/F100 feeds (n 80). Co-primary outcomes were change in MUAC and mortality to day 90. Secondary outcomes included weight gain (&gt; 5 g/kg/d), de novo development of diarrhoea, time to diarrhoea and oedema resolution. Day 90 MUAC increase was marginally lower in LF v. WHO arm (1·1 cm (interquartile range (IQR) 1·1) v. 1·4 cm (IQR 1·40), P = 0·09); day 90 mortality was similar (11/80 (13·8 %) v. 12/80 (15 %), respectively, OR 0·91 (95 % CI 0·40, 2·07), P = 0·83). There were no differences in any of the other secondary outcomes. Owing to initial poor palatability of the LF, ten children switched to WHO feeds. Per-protocol analysis indicated a trend to lower day 90 mortality and readmission rates in the LF (6/60 (10 %) and 2/60(3 %)) v. WHO feeds (12/71(17·5 %) and 4/71(6 %)). Further refinement of LF and clinical trials are warranted, given the poor outcomes in children with severe malnutrition.

## Synthesis of current pediatric urinary microbiome research.
 04.07.2024, _LM Jeries, TA Sysoeva, L Karstens, MS Kelly_


The human urinary bladder hosts a complex microbial community of low biomass referred to as the urobiome. While the composition of the urobiome has been investigated in adults for over a decade now, only a few studies have considered the presence and composition of the urobiome in children. It is critical to explore how the urobiome develops throughout the life span and how it changes in the presence of various health conditions. Therefore, we set to review the available data on pediatric urobiome composition and its development with age and disease. In addition, we focused on identifying and reporting specific gaps in our knowledge of the pediatric urobiome that we hope will be addressed by future studies in this swiftly developing field with fast-improving methods and consensus.

## Diet-microbiome interactions promote enteric nervous system resilience following spinal cord injury.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in numerous systemic dysfunctions, including intestinal dysmotility and enteric nervous system (ENS) atrophy. The ENS has capacity to recover following perturbation, yet intestinal pathologies persist. With emerging evidence demonstrating SCI-induced alterations to gut microbiome composition, we hypothesized that microbiome modulation contributes to post-injury enteric recovery. Here, we show that intervention with the dietary fiber, inulin, prevents SCI-induced ENS atrophy and dysmotility in mice. While SCI-associated microbiomes and specific injury-sensitive gut microbes are not sufficient to modulate intestinal dysmotility after injury, intervention with microbially-derived short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites prevents ENS dysfunctions in injured mice. Notably, inulin-mediated resilience is dependent on IL-10 signaling, highlighting a critical diet-microbiome-immune axis that promotes ENS resilience post-injury. Overall, we demonstrate that diet and microbially-derived signals distinctly impact ENS survival after traumatic spinal injury and represent a foundation to uncover etiological mechanisms and future therapeutics for SCI-induced neurogenic bowel.
