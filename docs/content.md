The fungal component of the human gut microbiome, also known as the mycobiome, plays a vital role in intestinal ecology and human health. However, the overall structure of the gut mycobiome as well as the inter-individual variations in fungal composition remains largely unknown. In this study, we collected a total of 3363 fungal sequencing samples from 16 cohorts across three continents, including 572 newly profiled samples from China.

Zhou et al. study nicely traces a significant topic in COVID-19 infection: the persistence of the virus within the intestinal tract. Many pathological mechanisms have been noted in the current literature about the mode of infection and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. Nevertheless, there are still many concerns about this: only some things seem well understood. We present a different point of view by illustrating the importance of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disorders.

## Caution regarding the specificities of pan-cancer microbial structure.
 15.08.2023, _A Gihawi, CS Cooper, DS Brewer_


_Humans, Reproducibility of Results, Microbiota, Machine Learning, Neoplasms_
Results published in an article by Poore et al. (Nature. 2020;579:567-574) suggested that machine learning models can almost perfectly distinguish between tumour types based on their microbial composition using machine learning models. Whilst we believe that there is the potential for microbial composition to be used in this manner, we have concerns with the paper that make us question the certainty of the conclusions drawn. We believe there are issues in the areas of the contribution of contamination, handling of batch effects, false positive classifications and limitations in the machine learning approaches used. This makes it difficult to identify whether the authors have identified true biological signal and how robust these models would be in use as clinical biomarkers. We commend Poore et al. on their approach to open data and reproducibility that has enabled this analysis. We hope that this discourse assists the future development of machine learning models and hypothesis generation in microbiome research.

## Gut microbial beta-glucuronidase: a vital regulator in female estrogen metabolism.
 14.08.2023, _S Hu, Q Ding, W Zhang, M Kang, J Ma, L Zhao_


A growing amount of evidence has supported that gut microbiota plays a vital role in the reproductive endocrine system throughout a woman's whole life, and gut microbial β-glucuronidase (gmGUS) is a key factor in regulating host estrogen metabolism. Moreover, estrogen levels also influence the composition as well as the diversity of gut microbiota. In normal condition, the gmGUS-estrogen crosstalk maintains body homeostasis of physiological estrogen level. Once this homeostasis is broken, the estrogen metabolism will be disturbed, resulting in estrogen-related diseases, such as gynecological cancers, menopausal syndrome, etc. together with gut microbial dysbiosis, which may accelerate these pathological processes. In this review, we highlight the regulatory role of gmGUS on the physical estrogen metabolism and estrogen-related diseases, summarize the present evidence of the interaction between gmGUS and estrogen metabolism, and unwrap the potential mechanisms behind them. Finally, gmGUS may become a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of estrogen-induced diseases. Regulating gmGUS activity or transplanting gmGUS-producing microbes shows promise for treating estrogen-related diseases.

## Three specific gut bacteria in the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer: a concerted effort.
 10.08.2023, _D Gong, AG Adomako-Bonsu, M Wang, J Li_


_Humans, Colorectal Neoplasms, Escherichia coli, Bacteria, Rectum_
Colorectal cancer (CRC), which develops from the gradual evolution of tubular adenomas and serrated polyps in the colon and rectum, has a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate. In addition to genetics, lifestyle, and chronic diseases, intestinal integrity and microbiota (which facilitate digestion, metabolism, and immune regulation) could promote CRC development. For example, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, genotoxic Escherichia coli (pks+ E. coli), and Fusobacterium nucleatum, members of the intestinal microbiota, are highly correlated in CRC. This review describes the roles and mechanisms of these three bacteria in CRC development. Their interaction during CRC initiation and progression has also been proposed. Our view is that in the precancerous stage of colorectal cancer, ETBF causes inflammation, leading to potential changes in intestinal ecology that may provide the basic conditions for pks+ E. coli colonization and induction of oncogenic mutations, when cancerous intestinal epithelial cells can further recruit F. nucleatum to colonise the lesion site and F. nucleatum may contribute to CRC advancement by primarily the development of cancer cells, stemization, and proliferation, which could create new and tailored preventive, screening and therapeutic interventions. However, there is the most dominant microbiota in each stage of CRC development, not neglecting the possibility that two or even all three bacteria could be engaged at any stage of the disease. The relationship between the associated gut microbiota and CRC development may provide important information for therapeutic strategies to assess the potential use of the associated gut microbiota in CRC studies, antibiotic therapy, and prevention strategies.

## The enhancement in toxic potency of oxidized functionalized polyethylene-microplastics in mice gut and Caco-2 cells.
 17.08.2023, _J Wang, H Tian, Y Shi, Y Yang, F Yu, H Cao, L Gao, M Liu_


Microplastics (MPs) are inevitably oxidized in the environment, however, to date, no studies have discussed the biological toxicity of oxidized polyethylene (Ox-PE) MPs. In this study, oxidized low-density polyethylene (Ox-LDPE), a representative Ox-PE, was prepared using a selective oxidation method. The difference in toxicity between LDPE-MPs and Ox-LDPE-MPs were evaluated in C57BL/6 mice and Caco-2 cells. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses revealed that some hydrocarbon-containing groups were transformed into carboxyl and ketone groups during selective oxidation. In vivo experiment results showed that LDPE-MPs and Ox-LDPE-MPs exists in the intestinal (duodenum and colon) of mice, and Ox-LDPE-MPs caused more severe intestinal histological changes, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response. The gut microbiota data showed that the relative abundance of Lactobacillus decreased significantly in the LDPE-MP- and Ox-LDPE-MP-exposed groups (P &lt; 0.05). The predicted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway suggested that exposure to LDPE-MPs or Ox-LDPE-MPs inhibited glycan biosynthesis and metabolism in the flora (P &lt; 0.05). In vitro experiment results showed that selective oxidation to LDPE promoted its uptake by cells and aggravated adverse effects on cells, including reduced cell viability, damaged cell membrane, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial depolarization. The major mechanism of the increased toxicity of Ox-LDPE-MPs may be its easier accumulation and the ionic effect of oxygen-containing functional groups. Overall, these findings provide insights on the differences in toxicity between LDPE-MPs and Ox-LDPE-MPs. They also provide new perspectives for understanding the biohazards of MPs, which are necessary to accurately assess the potential environmental and health risks of these plastic pollutants.

## Macroevolutionary constraints on global microbial diversity.
 11.08.2023, _FJ Fishman, JT Lennon_


Biologists have long sought to quantify the number of species on Earth. Often missing from these efforts is the contribution of microorganisms, the smallest but most abundant form of life on the planet. Despite recent large-scale sampling efforts, estimates of global microbial diversity span many orders of magnitude. It is important to consider how speciation and extinction over the last 4 billion years constrain inventories of biodiversity. We parameterized macroevolutionary models based on birth-death processes that assume constant and universal speciation and extinction rates. The models reveal that richness beyond 1012 species is feasible and in agreement with empirical predictions. Additional simulations suggest that mass extinction events do not place hard limits on modern-day microbial diversity. Together, our study provides independent support for a massive global-scale microbiome while shedding light on the upper limits of life on Earth.

## Evolutionary dynamics on sequential temporal networks.
 19.08.2023, _A Sheng, A Li, L Wang_


Population structure is a well-known catalyst for the evolution of cooperation and has traditionally been considered to be static in the course of evolution. Conversely, real-world populations, such as microbiome communities and online social networks, frequently show a progression from tiny, active groups to huge, stable communities, which is insufficient to be captured by constant structures. Here, we propose sequential temporal networks to characterize growing networked populations, and we extend the theory of evolutionary games to these temporal networks with arbitrary structures and growth rules. We derive analytical rules under which a sequential temporal network has a higher fixation probability for cooperation than its static counterpart. Under neutral drift, the rule is simply a function of the increment of nodes and edges in each time step. But if the selection is weak, the rule is related to coalescence times on networks. In this case, we propose a mean-field approximation to calculate fixation probabilities and critical benefit-to-cost ratios with lower calculation complexity. Numerical simulations in empirical datasets also prove the cooperation-promoting effect of population growth. Our research stresses the significance of population growth in the real world and provides a high-accuracy approximation approach for analyzing the evolution in real-life systems.

_Genomics, Proteomics, Computer Simulation, Microbiota, Algorithms_
Cellular omics such as single-cell genomics, proteomics, and microbiomics allow the characterization of tissue and microbial community composition, which can be compared between conditions to identify biological drivers. This strategy has been critical to revealing markers of disease progression, such as cancer and pathogen infection. A dedicated statistical method for differential variability analysis is lacking for cellular omics data, and existing methods for differential composition analysis do not model some compositional data properties, suggesting there is room to improve model performance. Here, we introduce sccomp, a method for differential composition and variability analyses that jointly models data count distribution, compositionality, group-specific variability, and proportion mean-variability association, being aware of outliers. sccomp provides a comprehensive analysis framework that offers realistic data simulation and cross-study knowledge transfer. Here, we demonstrate that mean-variability association is ubiquitous across technologies, highlighting the inadequacy of the very popular Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. We show that sccomp accurately fits experimental data, significantly improving performance over state-of-the-art algorithms. Using sccomp, we identified differential constraints and composition in the microenvironment of primary breast cancer.

## Metagenome sequencing and 103 microbial genomes from ballast water and sediments.
 14.08.2023, _Z Xue, Y Han, W Tian, W Zhang_


_Archaea, Bacteria, Genome, Microbial, Metagenome, Metagenomics, Microbiota_
The great threat of microbes carried by ballast water calls for figuring out the species composition of the ballast-tank microbial community, where the dark, cold, and anoxic tank environment might select special taxa. In this study, we reconstructed 103 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 102 bacteria and one archaea, from four vessels on international voyages. Of these MAGs, 60 were 'near complete' (completeness &gt;90%), 34 were &gt;80% complete, and nine were &gt;75% complete. Phylogenomic analysis revealed that over 70% (n = 74) of these MAGs represented new taxa at different taxonomical levels, including one order, three families, 12 genera, and 58 species. The species composition of these MAGs was most consistent with the previous reports, with the most abundant phyla being Proteobacteria (n = 69), Bacteroidota (n = 17), and Actinobacteriota (n = 7). These draft genomes provided novel data on species diversity and function in the ballast-tank microbial community, which will facilitate ballast water and sediments management.
