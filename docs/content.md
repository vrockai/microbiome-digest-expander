Although recent studies have indicated that intestinal microbiota dweller are involved in the pathogenesis of allergy rhinitis (AR), the influence of gut microbiota on AR adult has not been fully elucidated yet. Hence, we carried out this study to uncover the distinctive bacterial taxa that differentiate allergy rhinitis patients from healthy individuals. Feces samples from thirty three AR patients and thirty one healthy individuals were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

## Diagnosis and treatment of nerve injury following venipuncture - A report of two cases.
 21.07.2021, _IJ Kim, H Cho, MS Yi, YH Park, S Kim, DK Kim, HY Shin_


Venipuncture is one of the one of the most commonly performed, minimally-invasive procedures; however, it may lead to peripheral nerve injury. Here, we describe the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of two self-reported cases of nerve injury during venipuncture with the aim of drawing attention to possible needle-related nerve injuries.

## National surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities to dalbavancin, telavancin, tedizolid, eravacycline, omadacycline and other comparator antibiotics and serotype distribution of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in adults: results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART) programme in 2017-2020.

This study aimed to investigate the trends in serotypes and in vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae causing adult invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) to dalbavancin, telavancin, tedizolid, eravacycline, omadacycline and other comparator antibiotics from 2017 to 2020, following implementation of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Maternal cecal microbiota transfer rescues early-life antibiotic-induced enhancement of type 1 diabetes in mice.
 21.07.2021, _XS Zhang, YS Yin, J Wang, T Battaglia, K Krautkramer, WV Li, J Li, M Brown, M Zhang, MH Badri, AJS Armstrong, CM Strauch, Z Wang, I Nemet, N Altomare, JC Devlin, L He, JT Morton, JA Chalk, K Needles, V Liao, J Mount, H Li, KV Ruggles, RA Bonneau, MG Dominguez-Bello, F Bäckhed, SL Hazen, MJ Blaser_


Early-life antibiotic exposure perturbs the intestinal microbiota and accelerates type 1 diabetes (T1D) development in the NOD mouse model. Here, we found that maternal cecal microbiota transfer (CMT) to NOD mice after early-life antibiotic perturbation largely rescued the induced T1D enhancement. Restoration of the intestinal microbiome was significant and persistent, remediating the antibiotic-depleted diversity, relative abundance of particular taxa, and metabolic pathways. CMT also protected against perturbed metabolites and normalized innate and adaptive immune effectors. CMT restored major patterns of ileal microRNA and histone regulation of gene expression. Further experiments suggest a gut-microbiota-regulated T1D protection mechanism centered on Reg3γ, in an innate intestinal immune network involving CD44, TLR2, and Reg3γ. This regulation affects downstream immunological tone, which may lead to protection against tissue-specific T1D injury.

## Ejaculation Disorders in Male Patients With Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Prevalence.
 21.07.2021, _D Pizzol, M Trott, I Grabovac, L Yang, Y Barnett, C Parris, DT McDermott, N Veronese, A Kronbichler, RA Ghayda, P Soysal, L Jacob, MA Tully, A Koyanagi, CT Law, C Kaya, N Thirumavalavan, A Loeb, A Garolla, S Park, JI Shin, PC Ilie, L Smith_


Ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD) and erectile dysfunction after cancer treatment are clinically important complications, but their exact prevalence by various kinds of cancer site and type of treatment is unknown. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the available evidence and provide pooled estimates for prevalence of EjD and erectile dysfunction in relation to all cancer sites and identify characteristics associated with EjD in cancer patients.
