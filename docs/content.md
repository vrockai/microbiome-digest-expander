Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Although microbes besides Helicobacter pylori may also contribute to gastric carcinogenesis, wild-type germ-free (GF) mouse models investigating the role of human gastric microbiota in the process are not yet available. We aimed to evaluate the histopathological features of GF mouse stomachs transplanted with gastric microbiota from patients with different gastric disease states and their relationships with the microbiota.

## Disturbed microbial ecology in Alzheimer's disease: evidence from the gut microbiota and fecal metabolome.
 13.08.2021, _J Xi, D Ding, H Zhu, R Wang, F Su, W Wu, Z Xiao, X Liang, Q Zhao, Z Hong, H Fu, Q Xiao_


Gut microbiota (GMB) alteration has been reported to influence the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis through immune, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. This study aims to investigate metabolic output of the dysbiosis of GMB in AD pathogenesis. In this study, the fecal microbiota and metabolome from 21 AD participants and 44 cognitively normal control participants were measured. Untargeted GMB taxa was analyzed through 16S ribosomal RNA gene profiling based on next-generation sequencing and fecal metabolites were quantified by using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS).

Resistant starch type-2 (RS2), can mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the impact of the RS2 on the gut microbiota community in these patients. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of enriched RS2 cookies on the gut microbiome in HD patients.

## Coral microbiome manipulation elicits metabolic and genetic restructuring to mitigate heat stress and evade mortality.

Beneficial microorganisms for corals (BMCs) ameliorate environmental stress, but whether they can prevent mortality and the underlying host response mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we conducted omics analyses on the coral Mussismilia hispida exposed to bleaching conditions in a long-term mesocosm experiment and inoculated with a selected BMC consortium or a saline solution placebo. All corals were affected by heat stress, but the observed "post-heat stress disorder" was mitigated by BMCs, signified by patterns of dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation, lipid maintenance, and coral host transcriptional reprogramming of cellular restructuration, repair, stress protection, and immune genes, concomitant with a 40% survival rate increase and stable photosynthetic performance by the endosymbiotic algae. This study provides insights into the responses that underlie probiotic host manipulation. We demonstrate that BMCs trigger a dynamic microbiome restructuring process that instigates genetic and metabolic alterations in the coral host that eventually mitigate coral bleaching and mortality.

## Metapangenomics reveals depth-dependent shifts in metabolic potential for the ubiquitous marine bacterial SAR324 lineage.
 16.08.2021, _D Boeuf, JM Eppley, DR Mende, RR Malmstrom, T Woyke, EF DeLong_


Oceanic microbiomes play a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle and are central to the transformation and recycling of carbon and energy in the ocean's interior. SAR324 is a ubiquitous but poorly understood uncultivated clade of Deltaproteobacteria that inhabits the entire water column, from ocean surface waters to its deep interior. Although some progress has been made in elucidating potential metabolic traits of SAR324 in the dark ocean, very little is known about the ecology and the metabolic capabilities of this group in the euphotic and twilight zones. To investigate the comparative genomics, ecology, and physiological potential of the SAR324 clade, we examined the distribution and variability of key genomic features and metabolic pathways in this group from surface waters to the abyss in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, one of the largest biomes on Earth.

## Genes, environment, and developmental timing: New insights from translational approaches to understand early origins of respiratory diseases.
 13.08.2021, _MJ Gutierrez, GF Perez, JL Gomez, CE Rodriguez-Martinez, JA Castro-Rodriguez, G Nino_


Over the past decade, "omics" approaches have advanced our understanding of the molecular programming of the airways in humans. Several studies have identified potential molecular mechanisms that contribute to early life epigenetic reprogramming, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, microRNAs, and the homeostasis of the respiratory mucosa (epithelial function and microbiota). Current evidence supports the notion that early infancy is characterized by heightened susceptibility to airway genetic reprogramming in response to the first exposures in life, some of which can have life-long consequences. Here, we summarize and analyze the latest insights from studies that support a novel epigenetic paradigm centered on human maturational and developmental programs including three cardinal elements: genes, environment, and developmental timing. The combination of these factors is likely responsible for the functional trajectory of the respiratory system at the molecular, functional, and clinical levels.

## Contribution of Biotransformations Carried Out by the Microbiota, Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes, and Transport Proteins to the Biological Activities of Phytochemicals Found in the Diet.
 13.08.2021, _A Boronat, J Rodriguez-Morató, G Serreli, M Fitó, RF Tyndale, M Deiana, R de la Torre_


The consumption of dietary phytochemicals has been associated with several health benefits and relevant biological activities. It is postulated that biotransformations of these compounds regulated by the microbiota, Phase I/II reactions, transport proteins, and deconjugating enzymes contribute not only to their metabolic clearance but also, in some cases, to their bioactivation. A number of factors (age, genetics, sex, physiopathological conditions, and the interplay with other dietary phytochemicals) modulating metabolic activities are important sources and contributors to the interindividual variability observed in clinical studies evaluating the biological activities of phytochemicals. In this review, we discuss all the processes that can affect the bioaccessibility and beneficial effects of these bioactive compounds. Herein, we argue that the role of these factors must be further studied to correctly understand and predict the effects observed following the intake of phytochemicals. This is, in particular, with regard to in vitro investigations, which have shown great inconsistency with preclinical and clinical studies. The complexity of in vivo metabolic activity and biotransformation should therefore be considered in the interpretation of results in vitro and their translation to human physiopathology.

## The power and potential of BIOMAP to elucidate host-microbiome interplay in skin inflammatory diseases.

The two most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases are atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. The underpinnings of the remarkable degree of clinical heterogeneity of AD and psoriasis are poorly understood and, as a consequence, disease onset and progression are unpredictable and the optimal type and time-point for intervention are as yet unknown. The BIOMAP project is the first IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative) project dedicated to investigating the causes and mechanisms of AD and psoriasis and to identify potential biomarkers responsible for the variation in disease outcome. The consortium includes 7 large pharmaceutical companies and 25 non-industry partners including academia. Since there is mounting evidence supporting an important role for microbial exposures and our microbiota as factors mediating immune polarization and AD and psoriasis pathogenesis, an entire work package is dedicated to the investigation of skin and gut microbiome linked to AD or psoriasis. The large collaborative BIOMAP project will enable the integration of patient cohorts, data and knowledge in unprecedented proportions. The project has a unique opportunity with a potential to bridge and fill the gaps between current problems and solutions. This review highlights the power and potential of BIOMAP project in the investigation of microbe-host interplay in AD and psoriasis.

## Colliding and Interacting Microbiomes and Microbial Communities and Consequences for Human Health.
 14.08.2021, _S Mills, RP Ross_


Living "things" coexist with microorganisms, known as the microbiota/microbiome that provides essential physiological functions to its host. Despite this reliance the microbiome is malleable and can be altered by several factors including birth-mode, age, antibiotics, nutrition, and disease. In this minireview, we consider how other microbiomes and microbial communities impact the host microbiome and the host through the concept of microbiome collisions (initial exposures) and interactions. Interactions include changes in host microbiome composition and functionality and/or host responses. Understanding the impact of other microbiomes and microbial communities on the microbiome and host are important considering the decline in human microbiota diversity in the developed world - paralleled by the surge of non-communicable, inflammatory-based diseases. Thus, surrounding ourselves with rich and diverse beneficial microbiomes and microbial communities to collide and interact with should help to diminish the loss in microbial diversity and protect from certain diseases. In the same vein, our microbiomes not only influence our health but potentially the health of those close to us. We also consider strategies for enhanced host microbiome collisions and interactions through the surrounding environment that ensure increased microbiome diversity and functionality contributing to enhanced symbiotic return to the host in terms of health benefit.

## Tralokinumab in atopic dermatitis.
 14.08.2021, _A Wollenberg, S Weidinger, M Worm, T Bieber_


Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent eczematous lesions and intense pruritus, and it can have marked negative impact on those affected. Pathophysiologically, AD is complex with genetic predisposition and environmental provocation being important contributors. Mechanistically these can promote epidermal barrier dysfunction, skin microbiome abnormalities and a skewed immune response which is predominantly type-2 immunity-based. Our increased understanding of the immunological processes involved highlight a key role for interleukin-13 (IL-13). This mini-review evaluates tralokinumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits IL-13. Based on dose-finding study results, tralokinumab 300 mg every two weeks (Q2W) subcutaneously (SC) was investigated in three pivotal phase III clinical trials in adults with moderate-to-severe AD not adequately controlled on topical corticosteroids alone. Tralokinumab was significantly superior to placebo regarding the proportion of patients achieving IGA 0/1 and EASI-75 at week 16 (primary endpoints), as well as improving scores for worst daily pruritus, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) (secondary endpoints). The week 16 response was sustained during follow-up, and treatment with tralokinumab was found to be well-tolerated with an overall frequency and severity of adverse events comparable to placebo.

## Skin Microbiome-The Next Frontier for Probiotic Intervention.
 12.08.2021, _IJ McLoughlin, EM Wright, JR Tagg, R Jain, JDF Hale_


The skin is the largest organ in the human body, and it orchestrates many functions that are fundamentally important for our survival. Although the skin might appear to present a relatively inhospitable or even hostile environment, a multitude of commensals and also some potentially pathogenic microorganisms have successfully adapted to survive and/or thrive within the diverse ecological niches created by the skin's topographical architecture. Dysbiosis within these microbial populations can result in the emergence and pathological progression of skin diseases. Unsurprisingly, this has led to a new focus of research both for the medical dermatology and cosmetic industries that is concerned with modulation of the skin microbiome to help address common microbially mediated or modulated conditions such as acne, body odour, and atopic dermatitis. This review presents an overview of our current understanding of the complex relationship of the skin with its microbiome and then introduces the concept of probiotic intervention for the management of microbial dysbiosis within the skin ecosystem.

## Pathogenic Mechanisms of Trimethylamine N-Oxide-induced Atherosclerosis and Cardiomyopathy.
 13.08.2021, _Y Zheng, JQ He_


Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut microbiota metabolite derived from trimethylamine-containing nutrient precursors such as choline, L-carnitine, and betaine, which are rich in many vegetables, fruits, nuts, dairy products, and meats. An increasing number of clinical studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between elevated plasma TMAO levels and adverse cardiovascular events. It is commonly agreed that TMAO acts as both an independent risk factor and a prognostic index for patients with cardiovascular disease. Although most animal (mainly rodent) data support the clinical findings, the mechanisms by which TMAO modulates the cardiovascular system are still not well understood. In this context, we provide an overview of the potential mechanisms underlying TMAO-induced cardiovascular disease at the cellular and molecular levels, with a focus on atherosclerosis. We also address the direct effects of TMAO on cardiomyocytes (a new and under-researched area) and finally propose TMAO as a potential biomarker and/or therapeutic target for diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease.

## Juvenile social defeat stress exposure favors in later onset of irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in male mice.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder. Traumatic stress during adolescence increases the risk of IBS in adults. The aim of this study was to characterize the juvenile social defeat stress (SDS)-associated IBS model in mice. Juvenile mice were exposed to an aggressor mouse for 10 min once daily for 10 consecutive days. Behavioral tests, visceral sensitivity, immune responses, and fecal bacteria in the colon were evaluated in 5 weeks after SDS exposure. Social avoidance, anxiety- and depression-like behavior, and visceral hypersensitivity were observed. Juvenile SDS exposure significantly increased the number of 5-HT-containing cells and calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive neurons in the colon. The gut microbiota was largely similar between the control and juvenile SDS groups. The alterations in fecal pellet output, bead expulsion time, plasma corticosterone concentration, and colonic 5-HT content in response to restraint stress were exacerbated in the juvenile SDS group compared with the control group. The combination of juvenile SDS and restraint stress increased the noradrenaline metabolite 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) content and MHPG/noradrenaline ratio in the amygdala when compared with restraint stress in control mice. These results suggest that juvenile SDS exposure results in later onset of IBS-like symptoms.

Plants live with diverse microbial communities which profoundly affect multiple facets of host performance, but if and how host development impacts the assembly, functions and microbial interactions of crop microbiomes are poorly understood. Here we examined both bacterial and fungal communities across soils, epiphytic and endophytic niches of leaf and root, and plastic leaf of fake plant (representing environment-originating microbes) at three developmental stages of maize at two contrasting sites, and further explored the potential function of phylloplane microbiomes based on metagenomics.

## 16S rRNA Gene Metabarcoding Indicates Species-Characteristic Microbiomes in Deep-Sea Benthic Foraminifera.
 14.08.2021, _IS Salonen, PM Chronopoulou, H Nomaki, D Langlet, M Tsuchiya, KA Koho_


Foraminifera are unicellular eukaryotes that are an integral part of benthic fauna in many marine ecosystems, including the deep sea, with direct impacts on benthic biogeochemical cycles. In these systems, different foraminiferal species are known to have a distinct vertical distribution, i.e., microhabitat preference, which is tightly linked to the physico-chemical zonation of the sediment. Hence, foraminifera are well-adapted to thrive in various conditions, even under anoxia. However, despite the ecological and biogeochemical significance of foraminifera, their ecology remains poorly understood. This is especially true in terms of the composition and diversity of their microbiome, although foraminifera are known to harbor diverse endobionts, which may have a significant meaning to each species' survival strategy. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to investigate the microbiomes of five different deep-sea benthic foraminiferal species representing differing microhabitat preferences. The microbiomes of these species were compared intra- and inter-specifically, as well as with the surrounding sediment bacterial community. Our analysis indicated that each species was characterized with a distinct, statistically different microbiome that also differed from the surrounding sediment community in terms of diversity and dominant bacterial groups. We were also able to distinguish specific bacterial groups that seemed to be strongly associated with particular foraminiferal species, such as the family Marinilabiliaceae for Chilostomella ovoidea and the family Hyphomicrobiaceae for Bulimina subornata and Bulimina striata. The presence of bacterial groups that are tightly associated to a certain foraminiferal species implies that there may exist unique, potentially symbiotic relationships between foraminifera and bacteria that have been previously overlooked. Furthermore, the foraminifera contained chloroplast reads originating from different sources, likely reflecting trophic preferences and ecological characteristics of the different species. This study demonstrates the potential of 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding in resolving the microbiome composition and diversity of eukaryotic unicellular organisms, providing unique in situ insights into enigmatic deep-sea ecosystems.

## Microbial Community Composition Controls Carbon Flux Across Litter Types in Early Phase of Litter Decomposition.
 14.08.2021, _ME Kroeger, MR DeVan, J Thompson, R Johansen, V Gallegos-Graves, D Lopez, A Runde, T Yoshida, B Munsky, S Sevanto, MBN Albright, J Dunbar_


Leaf litter decomposition is a major carbon input to soil, making it a target for increasing soil carbon storage through microbiome engineering. We expand upon previous findings to show with multiple leaf litter types that microbial composition can drive variation in carbon flow from litter decomposition and specific microbial community features are associated with synonymous patterns of carbon flow among litter types. Although plant litter type selects for different decomposer communities, within a litter type, microbial composition drives variation in the quantity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measured at the end of the decomposition period. Bacterial richness was negatively correlated with DOC quantity, supporting our hypothesis that across multiple litter types there are common microbial traits linked to carbon flow patterns. Variation in DOC abundance (i.e., high versus low DOC) driven by microbial composition is tentatively due to differences in bacterial metabolism of labile compounds, rather than catabolism of non-labile substrates such as lignin. The temporal asynchrony of metabolic processes across litter types may be a substantial impediment to discovering more microbial features common to synonymous patterns of carbon flow among litters. Overall, our findings support the concept that carbon flow may be programmed by manipulating microbial community composition. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

## Contribution of stochastic processes to the microbial community assembly on field-collected microplastics.
 14.08.2021, _Y Sun, M Zhang, C Duan, N Cao, W Jia, Z Zhao, C Ding, Y Huang, J Wang_


A growing body of evidence suggests that microplastics may be colonized with a unique microbiome, termed "plastisphere", in aquatic environments. However, the deep mechanisms (deterministic and/or stochastic processes) underlying the community assembly on microplastics are still poorly understood. Here, we took the estuary of Hangzhou Bay (Zhejiang, China) as an example, and examined the assembly mechanisms of bacterial communities in water and microplastic samples. Results from high-throughput sequencing showed that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla across all samples. Additionally, microorganisms from plastisphere and planktonic communities exhibited contrasting taxonomic compositions, with greater within-group variation for microplastic samples. The null model analysis indicated the plastisphere bacterial communities were dominantly driven by the stochastic process of drift (58.34%) and dispersal limitation (23.41%). The normalized stochasticity ratio (NST) also showed that the community assembly on microplastics was more stochastic (NST &gt; 50%). Based on the Sloan neutral community model, the migration rate for plastisphere communities (0.015) was significantly lower than that for planktonic communities (0.936), potentially suggesting it is the stochastic balance between loss and gain of bacteria (e.g., stochastic births and deaths) critically shaping the community assembly on microplastics and generating the specific niches. This study greatly enhanced our understanding of the ecological patterns of microplastic-associated microbial communities in aquatic environments. This article is protected by copyright.

## Simultaneous ribosome profiling of hundreds of microbes from the human microbiome.
 12.08.2021, _BJ Fremin, C Nicolaou, AS Bhatt_


Ribosome profiling enables sequencing of ribosome-bound fragments of RNA, revealing which transcripts are being translated as well as the position of ribosomes along mRNAs. Although ribosome profiling has been applied to cultured bacterial isolates, its application to uncultured, mixed communities has been challenging. We present MetaRibo-Seq, a protocol that enables the application of ribosome profiling directly to the human fecal microbiome. MetaRibo-Seq is a benchmarked method that includes several modifications to existing ribosome profiling protocols, specifically addressing challenges involving fecal sample storage, purity and input requirements. We also provide a computational workflow to quality control and trim reads, de novo assemble a reference metagenome with metagenomic reads, align MetaRibo-Seq reads to the reference, and assess MetaRibo-Seq library quality ( https://github.com/bhattlab/bhattlab_workflows/tree/master/metariboseq ). This MetaRibo-Seq protocol enables researchers in standard molecular biology laboratories to study translation in the fecal microbiome in ~5 d.

## Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: In-Depth Computational Approach Revealing Multiple Sulfur's Reduction Pathways and Hidden Li+ Storage Mechanisms for Extra Discharge Capacity.
 14.01.2021, _S Perez Beltran, PB Balbuena_


Like no other sulfur host material, polyacrylonitrile-derived sulfurized carbon (SPAN) promises improved electrochemical performance for lithium-sulfur batteries, based on its compatibility with carbonate solvents and ability to prevent self-discharge and shuttle effect. However, a complete understanding of the SPAN's lithiation mechanism is still missing because its structural features vary widely with synthesis conditions, and its electrochemical performance deviates from elemental sulfur. This study continues our research on the elucidation of the SPAN's structural characteristics and lithiation mechanisms via computational approaches. Our models reproduce most experimental data regarding carbon's graphitization level and conjugated ordering, sulfur-carbon covalent bonding, sulfur loading, and elemental composition. Our simulations emulate the discharge voltage observed in experiments for the first discharge, which reveals that sulfur follows multiple reduction pathways based on its interaction with the carbon backbone. Sulfur reduction takes place above 1.0 V vs Li/Li+ mostly in the SPAN-like material, with no long-chain lithium polysulfide formation. Below 1.0 V vs Li/Li+, the backbone's electrochemical activity occurs via multiple C-Li and N-Li interactions, mostly with edge carbon atoms and pyridinic nitrogen. Moreover, we identify Li+ binding sites throughout the graphitized backbone that might lead to prohibited energy costs for Li+ deintercalation, which may explain the irreversible capacity loss between the first and second discharges. This work improves understanding of lithiation mechanisms in sulfurized carbon, which is useful for rationally designing SPAN synthesis pathways tailored to increase sulfur loading and enhanced electrochemical performance.
