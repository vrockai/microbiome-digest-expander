## Fungal diversity in deep-sea sediments from Magellan seamounts environment of the western Pacific revealed by high-throughput Illumina sequencing.
 02.09.2020, _S Yang, W Xu, Y Gao, X Chen, ZH Luo_


There are lots of seamounts globally whose primary production is disproportionally greater than the surrounding areas. Compared to other deep-sea environments, however, the seamounts environment is relatively less explored for fungal diversity. In the present study, we explored the fungal community structure in deep-sea sediments from four different stations of the Magellan seamounts environment by using high-throughput sequencing of the ITS1 region. A total of 1,897,618 ITS1 sequences were obtained. Among these sequences, fungal ITS1 sequences could be clustered into 1,662 OTUs. The majority of these sequences belonged to Ascomycota. In the genera level, the most abundant genus was Mortierella (4.79%), which was reported as a common fungal genus in soil and marine sediments, followed by Umbelopsis (3.80%), Cladosporium (2.98%), Saccharomycopsis (2.53%), Aspergillus (2.42%), Hortaea (2.36%), Saitozyma (2.20%), Trichoderma (2.12%), Penicillium (2.11%), Russula (1.86%), and Verticillium (1.40%). Most of these recovered genera belong to Ascomycota. The Bray-Curtis analysis showed that there was 37 to 85% dissimilarity of fungal communities between each two sediment samples. The Principal coordinates analysis clearly showed variations in the fungal community among different sediment samples. These results suggested that there was a difference in fungal community structures not only among four different sampling stations but also for different layers at the same station. The depth and geographical distance significantly affect the fungal community, and the effect of depth and geographical distance on the structure of the fungal community in the Magellan seamounts is basically same. Most of the fungi were more or less related to plants, these plant parasitic/symbiotic/endophytic fungi constitute a unique type of seamounts environmental fungal ecology, different from other marine ecosystems.

## Microplastics negatively affect soil fauna but stimulate microbial activity: insights from a field-based microplastic addition experiment.
 02.09.2020, _D Lin, G Yang, P Dou, S Qian, L Zhao, Y Yang, N Fanin_


Microplastics are recognized as an emerging contaminant worldwide. Although microplastics have been shown to strongly affect organisms in aquatic environments, less is known about whether and how microplastics can affect different taxa within a soil community, and it is unclear whether these effects can cascade through soil food webs. By conducting a microplastic manipulation experiment, i.e. adding low-density polyethylene fragments in the field, we found that microplastic addition significantly affected the composition and abundance of microarthropod and nematode communities. Contrary to soil fauna, we found only small effects of microplastics on the biomass and structure of soil microbial communities. Nevertheless, structural equation modelling revealed that the effects of microplastics strongly cascade through the soil food webs, leading to the modification of microbial functioning with further potential consequences on soil carbon and nutrient cycling. Our results highlight that taking into account the effects of microplastics at different trophic levels is important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ecological impacts of microplastic pollution on soil functioning.

## Shared bicycle microbial community: a potential antibiotic-resistant bacteria warehouse.
 05.09.2020, _Y Wu, J Xie, J Li, J Zhao, S Qiao, Y Li, J Zeng_


Shared bicycle is an emerging form of public transportation in China and around the world. However, the bacterial community and drug-resistant microbiome on these bicycles have not been reported. Samples from 10 shared bicycles were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Nine samples collected from 90 shared bicycles in three different kinds of location (hospital, metro station, shopping mall) were used for full-length 16S rDNA gene analysis to figure out the bacterial composition of the shared bicycle. Samples from 32 shared bicycles were used to investigate culturable drug-resistant bacteria of the shared bicycle bacterial community. It was found that in the shared bicycle bacterial community, Bacillus was the most abundant bacteria, as determined by both SEM observation and full-length 16S rDNA gene analysis. For the analysis of drug-resistant bacteria, Bacillus showed the strongest drug resist ability. Moreover, the resistances to bacitracin and sulfamethoxazole were the most common among all types of bacteria. Our study provides an important reference for the prevention of the potential spread of drug-resistant bacteria through shared bicycles.

## Microbial carrying capacity and carbon biomass of plastic marine debris.
 03.09.2020, _S Zhao, ER Zettler, LA Amaral-Zettler, TJ Mincer_


Trillions of plastic debris fragments are floating at sea, presenting a substantial surface area for microbial colonization. Numerous cultivation-independent surveys have characterized plastic-associated microbial biofilms, however, quantitative studies addressing microbial carbon biomass are lacking. Our confocal laser scanning microscopy data show that early biofilm development on polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and glass substrates displayed variable cell size, abundance, and carbon biomass, whereas these parameters stabilized in mature biofilms. Unexpectedly, plastic substrates presented lower volume proportions of photosynthetic cells after 8 weeks, compared to glass. Early biofilms displayed the highest proportions of diatoms, which could influence the vertical transport of plastic debris. In total, conservative estimates suggest 2.1 × 1021 to 3.4 × 1021 cells, corresponding to about 1% of the microbial cells in the ocean surface microlayer (1.5 × 103 to 1.1 × 104 tons of carbon biomass), inhabit plastic debris globally. As an unnatural addition to sea surface waters, the large quantity of cells and biomass carried by plastic debris has the potential to impact biodiversity, autochthonous ecological functions, and biogeochemical cycles within the ocean.
