Recent evidence has linked the gut microbiome to host behavior via the gut-brain axis [1-3]; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. Here, we determined the links between host genetics, the gut microbiome and memory using the genetically defined Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse cohort, complemented with microbiome and metabolomic analyses in conventional and germ-free (GF) mice.

Inflammation is a major risk factor of morbidity and mortality in older adults. Although its precise etiology is unknown, low-grade inflammation in older adults is commonly associated with increased intestinal epithelial permeability (leaky gut) and abnormal (dysbiotic) gut microbiota. The increasing older population and lack of treatments to reduce aging-related microbiota dysbiosis, leaky gut and inflammation culminates on a rise in aging-related comorbidities, constituting a significant public health concern. Here we demonstrate that a human-origin probiotic cocktail containing 5-Lactobacillus and 5 Enterococcus strains isolated from healthy infant's gut prevents high-fat diet (HFD)-induced microbiota dysbiosis, leaky gut, inflammation, metabolic dysfunctions and physical function decline in older mice. Probiotic-modulated gut microbiota primarily reduced leaky gut by increasing tight junctions, which in turn reduced inflammation. Mechanistically, probiotics modulated microbiota in a way to increases bile salt hydrolase activity, which in turn increased taurine abundance in the gut that stimulated tight junctions and suppressed gut leakiness. Further, in Caenorhabditis elegans, taurine increased life span, reduced adiposity and leaky gut, and enhanced physical function. The results suggest that such probiotic therapies could prevent or treat aging-related leaky gut and inflammation in elderly.

This study describes the bacterial community composition within the intestinal ecosystem of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Sequences from intestinal samples from Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) farmed in New Zealand and rainbow trout farmed in Turkey were also included for comparative purposes. The results revealed that the most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were affiliated to the genus Mycoplasma, but were not specifically associated with any known species. Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that these OTUs represent potentially novel species within the genus Mycoplasma.

## Rapid Reconstitution of the Faecal Microbiome after Extended Diet-Induced Changes Indicate a Stable Gut Microbiome in Healthy Adult Dogs.
 18.04.2020, _D Allaway, R Haydock, ZN Lonsdale, OD Deusch, C O'Flynn, KR Hughes_


The gut microbiome has an important role in health, and diet represents a key lever for shaping the gut microbiome across all stages of life. Maternal milk consumption in neonates leads to long-term health effects, indicating pliability in the infant gut microbiome in response to diet can drive enduring change. The ability of diet to drive lasting change in the adult gut microbiome is less understood. We studied the effect of an extreme dietary shift on the faecal microbiome of 46 Labrador retriever dogs (mean age 4.6 years) over 11 months. Dogs were fed a nutritionally-complete commercially available, complex diet (CD) for a minimum of 5 weeks, followed by highly purified diets (PD) for 36 weeks and the initial CD for at least a further 4 weeks. Faecal samples were collected at regular intervals for DNA extraction. Analysing 16S rDNA genotypes and the metagenomes, we observed minor effects on microbial diversity; but significant changes in bacterial taxa and genetic potential when PD was fed. Specifically, metagenomics identified enrichment of quinone and GABA-related pathways on PD, providing insights into dietary effects on cross-feeding strategies impacting community structure. When dogs returned to CD, no significant differences were found with the initial time point. These findings are consistent with the gut microbiome being rapidly adaptable, but capable of being reconstituted when provided with similar diets. These data highlight that long term changes in the adult dog gut microbiome may only be achieved through long-term maintenance on a specified diet, rather than through feeding a transitionary diet.Importance Diet can influence the adult gut microbiome (the community of bacteria) with health implications, but the ability to create changes persisting beyond feeding of a diet is poorly understood. We investigated whether feeding highly purified diets to adult dogs for 36 weeks would alter bacterial populations sufficiently to result in persistent change following the dogs' return to a commercial diet. As expected, the microbiome changed when the purified diet was fed, but the original microbiome was reconstituted within weeks of the dogs returning to the commercial diet. The significance of these findings is in identifying an intrinsic stability of the host microbiome in healthy dogs, suggesting that dietary changes to support adult dog health through modifying the gut microbiome may only be achieved through maintenance on a specified diet, rather than through feeding transitionary diets.

## Harnessing rhizosphere microbiomes for drought-resilient crop production.
 17.04.2020, _FT de Vries, RI Griffiths, CG Knight, O Nicolitch, A Williams_


Root-associated microbes can improve plant growth, and they offer the potential to increase crop resilience to future drought. Although our understanding of the complex feedbacks between plant and microbial responses to drought is advancing, most of our knowledge comes from non-crop plants in controlled experiments. We propose that future research efforts should attempt to quantify relationships between plant and microbial traits, explicitly focus on food crops, and include longer-term experiments under field conditions. Overall, we highlight the need for improved mechanistic understanding of the complex feedbacks between plants and microbes during, and particularly after, drought. This requires integrating ecology with plant, microbiome, and molecular approaches and is central to making crop production more resilient to our future climate.

Among the bacterial genera that are employed for cheese production, Lactobacillus is a key taxon of high industrial relevance being commonly present in commercial starter cultures for dairy fermentations. Certain lactobacilli play a defining role in the development of the organoleptic features during the ripening stages of particular cheeses. We performed an in depth 16S rRNA gene-based microbiota analysis coupled with ITS-mediated Lactobacillus compositional profiling of 21 common Italian cheeses produced from raw milk in order to evaluate the ecological distribution of lactobacilli associated with this food matrix. Statistical analysis of the collected data revealed the existence of putative Lactobacillus Community State Types (LCSTs), which consist of clusters of Lactobacillus (sub)species. Each LCST is dominated by one or two taxa that appear to represent key stone elements of an elaborate network of positive and negative interactions with minor components of the cheese microbiota. The results obtained in this study reveal the existence of peculiar cheese microbiota assemblies that represent intriguing targets for further functional studies aimed at dissecting the species-specific role of bacteria in cheese manufacturing.Importance The microbiota is known to play a key role in the development of the organoleptic features of dairy products. Lactobacilli have been reported to represent one of the main components of the non-starter bacterial population, i.e. bacteria that are not deliberately added to the milk, harbored by cheese, although the species-level composition of this microbial population has never been assessed in detail. In the current study, we applied a recently developed metagenomic approach that employs the Internally Transcribed Spacer to profile the Lactobacillus population harbored by cheese produced from raw milk at (sub)species level. The obtained data revealed the existence of particular Lactobacillus Community State Types (LCSTs) consisting of clusters of Lactobacillus (sub)species that tend to co-occur in the screened cheeses. Moreover, analysis of co-variances between members of this genus indicate that these taxa form an elaborate network of positive and negative interactions that define specific Clusters of Covariant Lactobacilli (CCL).

## Probiotic supplementation improves cognitive function and mood with changes in gut microbiota in community-dwelling elderly: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial.
 17.04.2020, _CS Kim, L Cha, M Sim, S Jung, WY Chun, HW Baik, DM Shin_


Probiotics have been proposed to ameliorate cognitive impairment and depressive disorder via the gut-brain axis in patients and experimental animal models. However, the beneficial role of probiotics in brain functions of healthy elderly remains unclear. Therefore, a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled multicenter trial was conducted to determine the effects of probiotics on cognition and mood in community-dwelling elderly. Sixty-three healthy elders (≥ 65 years) consumed either placebo or probiotics containing Bifidobacteriumbifidum BGN4 and Bifidobacteriumlongum BORI (1 × 109 CFU/d) for 12 weeks. The gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics. Brain functions were measured using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, Satisfaction with life scale, stress questionnaire, Geriatric depression scale, and Positive affect and negative affect schedule. Blood brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was determined using ELISA. Relative abundance of gut bacteria was significantly reduced at week 12 in the probiotics group (p &lt;0.05). The probiotics group showed greater improvement in mental flexibility test and stress score than the placebo group (p &lt;0.05). Contrary to placebo, probiotics significantly increased serum BDNF level (p &lt;0.05). Notably, the gut microbes significantly shifted by probiotics (Eubacterium and Clostridiales) showed significant negative correlation with serum BDNF level only in the probiotics group (RS = -0.37, RS = -0.39, p &lt;0.05). In conclusion, probiotics promote mental flexibility and alleviate stress in healthy elderly, along with causing changes in gut microbiota. These results provide evidence supporting health-promoting properties of probiotics as a part of healthy diet in the elderly.

## Intestinal microbiome-macrophage crosstalk contributes to cholestatic liver disease by promoting intestinal permeability.
 13.03.2020, _A Isaacs-Ten, M Echeandia, M Moreno-Gonzalez, A Brion, A Goldson, M Philo, AM Patterson, A Parker, M Galduroz, D Baker, SM Rushbrook, F Hildebrand, N Beraza_


Mounting evidence supports an association between cholestatic liver disease and changes in the composition of the microbiome. Still, the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of this condition remains largely undefined. To address this, we have used two experimental models, administering ANIT or feeding a 0.1%DDC diet, to induce cholestatic liver disease in germ-free mice and germ-free mice conventionalized with the microbiome from WT SPF animals. Next, we have inhibited macrophage activation by depleting these cells using clodronate-liposomes and inhibiting the inflammasome with a specific inhibitor of Nlrp3. Our results demonstrate that cholestasis, the accumulation of bile acids in the liver, fails to promote liver injury in the absence of the microbiome in vivo. Additional in vitro studies supported that endotoxin sensitizes hepatocytes to bile acid-induced cell death. We also demonstrate that during cholestasis, macrophages contribute to promoting intestinal permeability and to altered microbiome composition via the activation of the inflammasome, overall leading to increased endotoxin flux into the cholestatic liver. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the intestinal microbiome contributes to cholestasis-mediated cell death and inflammation via mechanisms involving the activation of the inflammasome in macrophages.
