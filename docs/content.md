## Landscapes of bacterial and metabolic signatures and their interaction in major depressive disorders.
 03.12.2020, _J Yang, P Zheng, Y Li, J Wu, X Tan, J Zhou, Z Sun, X Chen, G Zhang, H Zhang, Y Huang, T Chai, J Duan, W Liang, B Yin, J Lai, T Huang, Y Du, P Zhang, J Jiang, C Xi, L Wu, J Lu, T Mou, Y Xu, SW Perry, ML Wong, J Licinio, S Hu, G Wang, P Xie_


Gut microbiome disturbances have been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, little is known about how the gut virome, microbiome, and fecal metabolome change, and how they interact in MDD. Here, using whole-genome shotgun metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic methods, we identified 3 bacteriophages, 47 bacterial species, and 50 fecal metabolites showing notable differences in abundance between MDD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Patients with MDD were mainly characterized by increased abundance of the genus Bacteroides and decreased abundance of the genera Blautia and Eubacterium These multilevel omics alterations generated a characteristic MDD coexpression network. Disturbed microbial genes and fecal metabolites were consistently mapped to amino acid (Î³-aminobutyrate, phenylalanine, and tryptophan) metabolism. Furthermore, we identified a combinatorial marker panel that robustly discriminated MDD from HC individuals in both the discovery and validation sets. Our findings provide a deep insight into understanding of the roles of disturbed gut ecosystem in MDD.

## Improved high-molecular-weight DNA extraction, nanopore sequencing and metagenomic assembly from the human gut microbiome.
 05.12.2020, _DG Maghini, EL Moss, SE Vance, AS Bhatt_


Short-read metagenomic sequencing and de novo genome assembly of the human gut microbiome can yield draft bacterial genomes without isolation and culture. However, bacterial genomes assembled from short-read sequencing are often fragmented. Furthermore, these metagenome-assembled genomes often exclude repeated genomic elements, such as mobile genetic elements, compromising our understanding of the contribution of these elements to important bacterial phenotypes. Although long-read sequencing has been applied successfully to the assembly of contiguous bacterial isolate genomes, extraction of DNA of sufficient molecular weight, purity and quantity for metagenomic sequencing from stool samples can be challenging. Here, we present a protocol for the extraction of microgram quantities of high-molecular-weight DNA from human stool samples that are suitable for downstream long-read sequencing applications. We also present Lathe ( www.github.com/bhattlab/lathe ), a computational workflow for long-read basecalling, assembly, consensus refinement with long reads or Illumina short reads and genome circularization. Altogether, this protocol can yield high-quality contiguous or circular bacterial genomes from a complex human gut sample in approximately 10 d, with 2 d of hands-on bench and computational effort.

## The Healthy Microbiome (What is the definition of a healthy gut microbiome?).
 30.11.2020, _F Shanahan, TS Ghosh, PW O'Toole_


Use of microbiome-based biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis, risk profiling, and precision therapy requires definition of a healthy microbiome in different populations. To determine features of the intestinal microbiota associated with health, however, we need improved microbiome profiling technologies, with strain-level resolution. We must also learn more about how the microbiome varies among apparently healthy people, how it changes with age, and the effects of diet, medications, ethnicity, geography, and lifestyle. Furthermore, many intestinal microbes, including viruses, phage, fungi, and archaea, have not been characterized, and little is known about their contributions to health and disease.Whether a healthy microbiome can be defined is an important and seemingly simple question, but with a complex answer in continual need of refinement.

## The gut microbiota is associated with immune cell dynamics in humans.
 07.12.2020, _J Schluter, JU Peled, BP Taylor, KA Markey, M Smith, Y Taur, R Niehus, A Staffas, A Dai, E Fontana, LA Amoretti, RJ Wright, S Morjaria, M Fenelus, MS Pessin, NJ Chao, M Lew, L Bohannon, A Bush, AD Sung, TM Hohl, MA Perales, MRM van den Brink, JB Xavier_


The gut microbiota influences development1-3 and homeostasis4-7 of the mammalian immune system, and is associated with human inflammatory8 and immune diseases9,10 as well as responses to immunotherapy11-14. Nevertheless, our understanding of how gut bacteria modulate the immune system remains limited, particularly in humans, where the difficulty of direct experimentation makes inference challenging. Here we study hundreds of hospitalized-and closely monitored-patients with cancer receiving haematopoietic cell transplantation as they recover from chemotherapy and stem-cell engraftment. This aggressive treatment causes large shifts in both circulatory immune cell and microbiota populations, enabling the relationships between the two to be studied simultaneously. Analysis of observed daily changes in circulating neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts and more than 10,000 longitudinal microbiota samples revealed consistent associations between gut bacteria and immune cell dynamics. High-resolution clinical metadata and Bayesian inference allowed us to compare the effects of bacterial genera in relation to those of immunomodulatory medications, revealing a considerable influence of the gut microbiota-together and over time-on systemic immune cell dynamics. Our analysis establishes and quantifies the link between the gut microbiota and the human immune system, with implications for microbiota-driven modulation of immunity.

## Utilizing the gut microbiome in decompensated cirrhosis and acute-on-chronic liver failure.
 01.12.2020, _J Trebicka, P Bork, A Krag, M Arumugam_


The human gut microbiome has emerged as a major player in human health and disease. The liver, as the first organ to encounter microbial products that cross the gut epithelial barrier, is affected by the gut microbiome in many ways. Thus, the gut microbiome might play a major part in the development of liver diseases. The common end stage of liver disease is decompensated cirrhosis and the further development towards acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). These conditions have high short-term mortality. There is evidence that translocation of components of the gut microbiota, facilitated by different pathogenic mechanisms such as increased gut epithelial permeability and portal hypertension, is an important driver of decompensation by induction of systemic inflammation, and thereby also ACLF. Elucidating the role of the gut microbiome in the aetiology of decompensated cirrhosis and ACLF deserves further investigation and improvement; and might be the basis for development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this Review, we focus on the possible pathogenic, diagnostic and therapeutic role of the gut microbiome in decompensation of cirrhosis and progression to ACLF.
