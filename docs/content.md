## PTHrP, A Biomarker for CNS Metastasis in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer and Selection for Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Node-Negative Disease.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by poor prognosis and lack of targeted therapies and biomarkers to guide decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer and involved in proliferation and metastasis, two hallmarks of poor prognosis for node-negative breast cancer. We investigated the prognostic value of PTHrP with respect to organ-specific metastasis and nodal status in TNBC.
