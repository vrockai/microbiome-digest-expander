Gut metaproteomics can provide direct evidence of microbial functions actively expressed in the colonic environments, contributing to clarify the role of the gut microbiota in human physiology. In this study, we re-analyzed 10 fecal metaproteomics datasets of healthy individuals from different continents and countries, with the aim of identifying stable and variable gut microbial functions and defining the contribution of specific bacterial taxa to the main metabolic pathways. The "core" metaproteome included 182 microbial functions and 83 pathways that were identified in all individuals analyzed. Several enzymes involved in glucose and pyruvate metabolism, along with glutamate dehydrogenase, acetate kinase, elongation factors G and Tu and DnaK, were the proteins with the lowest abundance variability in the cohorts under study. On the contrary, proteins involved in chemotaxis, response to stress and cell adhesion were among the most variable functions. Random-effect meta-analysis of correlation trends between taxa, functions and pathways revealed key ecological and molecular associations within the gut microbiota. The contribution of specific bacterial taxa to the main biological processes was also investigated, finding that Faecalibacterium is the most stable genus and the top contributor to anti-inflammatory butyrate production in the healthy gut microbiota. Active production of other mucosal immunomodulators facilitating host tolerance was observed, including Roseburia flagellin and lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic enzymes expressed by members of Bacteroidota. Our study provides a detailed picture of the healthy human gut microbiota, contributing to unveil its functional mechanisms and its relationship with nutrition, immunity, and environmental stressors.

## Driving gut microbiota enterotypes through host genetics.

Population stratification based on interindividual variability in gut microbiota composition has revealed the existence of several ecotypes named enterotypes in humans and various animal species. Enterotypes are often associated with environmental factors including diet, but knowledge of the role of host genetics remains scarce. Moreover, enterotypes harbor functionalities likely associated with varying abilities and susceptibilities of their host. Previously, we showed that under controlled conditions, 60-day-old pig populations consistently split into two enterotypes with either Prevotella and Mitsuokella (PM enterotype) or Ruminococcus and Treponema (RT enterotype) as keystone taxa. Here, our aim was to rely on pig as a model to study the influence of host genetics to assemble enterotypes, and to provide clues on enterotype functional differences and their links with growth traits.

Neutrophils are increasingly implicated in chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders. Here, we show that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from individuals with obesity contains more neutrophils than in those without obesity and is associated with a distinct bacterial community. Exploring the mechanism, we gavaged microbiome-depleted mice with stool from patients with and without obesity during high-fat or normal diet administration. Only mice receiving high-fat diet and stool from subjects with obesity show enrichment of VAT neutrophils, suggesting donor microbiome and recipient diet determine VAT neutrophilia. A rise in pro-inflammatory CD4+ Th1 cells and a drop in immunoregulatory T cells in VAT only follows if there is a transient spike in neutrophils. Human VAT neutrophils exhibit a distinct gene expression pattern that is found in different human tissues, including tumors. VAT neutrophils and bacteria may be a novel therapeutic target for treating inflammatory-driven complications of obesity, including insulin resistance and colon cancer.

## Fecal, Duodenal and Tumor Microbiota Composition of Esophageal Carcinoma Patients, a Longitudinal Prospective Cohort.

The microbiome has been associated with chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy. How this pertains to resectable esophageal carcinoma (EC) is unknown. Our aim was to identify microbial signatures in resectable EC associated with response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) with or without ICI.

## Role of the intestinal microbiota in contributing to weight disorders and associated comorbidities.
 28.06.2024, _M Van Hul, AM Neyrinck, A Everard, A Abot, LB Bindels, NM Delzenne, C Knauf, PD Cani_


SUMMARYThe gut microbiota is a major factor contributing to the regulation of energy homeostasis and has been linked to both excessive body weight and accumulation of fat mass (i.e., overweight, obesity) or body weight loss, weakness, muscle atrophy, and fat depletion (i.e., cachexia). These syndromes are characterized by multiple metabolic dysfunctions including abnormal regulation of food reward and intake, energy storage, and low-grade inflammation. Given the increasing worldwide prevalence of obesity, cachexia, and associated metabolic disorders, novel therapeutic strategies are needed. Among the different mechanisms explaining how the gut microbiota is capable of influencing host metabolism and energy balance, numerous studies have investigated the complex interactions existing between nutrition, gut microbes, and their metabolites. In this review, we discuss how gut microbes and different microbiota-derived metabolites regulate host metabolism. We describe the role of the gut barrier function in the onset of inflammation in this context. We explore the importance of the gut-to-brain axis in the regulation of energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism but also the key role played by the liver. Finally, we present specific key examples of how using targeted approaches such as prebiotics and probiotics might affect specific metabolites, their signaling pathways, and their interactions with the host and reflect on the challenges to move from bench to bedside.

## The gut microbiome in disorders of gut-brain interaction.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), chronic disorders characterized by either abdominal pain, altered intestinal motility, or their combination, have a worldwide prevalence of more than 40% and impose a high socioeconomic burden with a significant decline in quality of life. Recently, FGIDs have been reclassified as disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), reflecting the key role of the gut-brain bidirectional communication in these disorders and their impact on psychological comorbidities. Although, during the past decades, the field of DGBIs has advanced significantly, the molecular mechanisms underlying DGBIs pathogenesis and pathophysiology, and the role of the gut microbiome in these processes are not fully understood. This review aims to discuss the latest body of literature on the complex microbiota-gut-brain interactions and their implications in the pathogenesis of DGBIs. A better understanding of the existing communication pathways between the gut microbiome and the brain holds promise in developing effective therapeutic interventions for DGBIs.

## Multi-omics signatures reveal genomic and functional heterogeneity of Cutibacterium acnes in normal and diseased skin.
 03.07.2024, _T Yu, X Xu, Y Liu, X Wang, S Wu, Z Qiu, X Liu, X Pan, C Gu, S Wang, L Dong, W Li, X Yao_


Cutibacterium acnes is the most abundant bacterium of the human skin microbiome since adolescence, participating in both skin homeostasis and diseases. Here, we demonstrate individual and niche heterogeneity of C. acnes from 1,234 isolate genomes. Skin disease (atopic dermatitis and acne) and body site shape genomic differences of C. acnes, stemming from horizontal gene transfer and selection pressure. C. acnes harbors characteristic metabolic functions, fewer antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors, and a more stable genome compared with Staphylococcus epidermidis. Integrated genome, transcriptome, and metabolome analysis at the strain level unveils the functional characteristics of C. acnes. Consistent with the transcriptome signature, C. acnes in a sebum-rich environment induces toxic and pro-inflammatory effects on keratinocytes. L-carnosine, an anti-oxidative stress metabolite, is up-regulated in the C. acnes metabolome from atopic dermatitis and attenuates skin inflammation. Collectively, our study reveals the joint impact of genes and the microenvironment on C. acnes function.

## Vaginal anaerobes are associated with cervicitis: a case-control study.

Cervicitis is associated with important reproductive sequelae. Primary causes include chlamydia and gonorrhoea, but a known sexually transmitted infection (STI) is not identified in &gt;50% of cases (i.e. STI-negative cervicitis). Bacterial vaginosis (BV) and specific BV-associated bacteria have also been associated with cervicitis, but data are limited. We investigated the association between STI-negative cervicitis and vaginal microbiota composition.
