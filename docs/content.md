## Abiotic factors influence patterns of bacterial diversity and community composition in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica.
 02.04.2020, _EM Bottos, DC Laughlin, CW Herbold, CK Lee, IR McDonald, SC Cary_


The Dry Valleys of Antarctica are a unique ecosystem of simple trophic structure, where the abiotic factors that influence soil bacterial communities can be resolved in the absence of extensive biotic interactions. This study evaluated the degree to which aspects of topographic, physicochemical, and spatial variation explain patterns of bacterial richness and community composition in 471 soil samples collected across a 220 square kilometer landscape in Southern Victoria Land. Richness was most strongly influenced by physicochemical soil properties, particularly soil conductivity, though significant trends with several topographic and spatial variables were also observed. Structural equation modeling (SEM) supported a final model in which variation in community composition was best explained by physicochemical variables, particularly soil water content, and where the effects of topographic variation were largely mediated through their influence on physicochemical variables. Community dissimilarity increased with distance between samples, and though most of this variation was explained by topographic and physicochemical variation, a small but significant relationship remained after controlling for this environmental variation. As the largest survey of terrestrial bacterial communities of Antarctica completed to date, this work provides fundamental knowledge of the Dry Valleys ecosystem, and has implications globally for understanding environmental factors that influence bacterial distributions.

## Structure and function of the Arctic and Antarctic marine microbiota as revealed by metagenomics.

The Arctic and Antarctic are the two most geographically distant bioregions on earth. Recent sampling efforts and following metagenomics have shed light on the global ocean microbial diversity and function, yet the microbiota of polar regions has not been included in such global analyses.

## Microbiome and ecology of a hot spring-microbialite system on the Trans-Himalayan Plateau.

Little is known about life in the boron-rich hot springs of Trans-Himalayas. Here, we explore the geomicrobiology of a 4438-m-high spring which emanates ~70 °C-water from a boratic microbialite called Shivlinga. Due to low atmospheric pressure, the vent-water is close to boiling point so can entropically destabilize biomacromolecular systems. Starting from the vent, Shivlinga's geomicrobiology was revealed along the thermal gradients of an outflow-channel and a progressively-drying mineral matrix that has no running water; ecosystem constraints were then considered in relation to those of entropically comparable environments. The spring-water chemistry and sinter mineralogy were dominated by borates, sodium, thiosulfate, sulfate, sulfite, sulfide, bicarbonate, and other macromolecule-stabilizing (kosmotropic) substances. Microbial diversity was high along both of the hydrothermal gradients. Bacteria, Eukarya and Archaea constituted &gt;98%, ~1% and &lt;1% of Shivlinga's microbiome, respectively. Temperature constrained the biodiversity at ~50 °C and ~60 °C, but not below 46 °C. Along each thermal gradient, in the vent-to-apron trajectory, communities were dominated by Aquificae/Deinococcus-Thermus, then Chlorobi/Chloroflexi/Cyanobacteria, and finally Bacteroidetes/Proteobacteria/Firmicutes. Interestingly, sites of &gt;45 °C were inhabited by phylogenetic relatives of taxa for which laboratory growth is not known at &gt;45 °C. Shivlinga's geomicrobiology highlights the possibility that the system's kosmotrope-dominated chemistry mitigates against the biomacromolecule-disordering effects of its thermal water.
