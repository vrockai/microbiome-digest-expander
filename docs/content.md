The human gut microbiota develops soon after birth and can acquire inter-individual variation upon exposure to intrinsic and environmental cues. However, inter-individual variation has not been comprehensively assessed in a multi-ethnic study. We studied a longitudinal birth cohort of 106 infants of three Asian ethnicities (Chinese, Malay, and Indian) that resided in the same geographical location (Singapore). Specific and temporal influences of ethnicity, mode of delivery, breastfeeding status, gestational age, birthweight, gender, and maternal education on the development of the gut microbiota in the first 2 years of life were studied. Mode of delivery, breastfeeding status, and ethnicity were identified as the main factors influencing the compositional development of the gut microbiota. Effects of delivery mode and breastfeeding status lasted until 6M and 3M, respectively, with the primary impact on the diversity and temporal colonization of the genera Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. The effect of ethnicity was apparent at 3M post-birth, even before the introduction of weaning (complementary) foods, and remained significant after adjusting for delivery mode and breastfeeding status. Ethnic influences remained significant until 12M in the Indian and Chinese infants. The microbiota of Indian infants was characterized by higher abundances of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, while Chinese infants had higher abundances of Bacteroides and Akkermansia. These findings provide a detailed insight into the specific and temporal influences of early life factors and ethnicity in the development of the human gut microbiota. Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov registration no. NCT01174875.

## Dissimilarity of Airway and Lung Tissue Microbiota in Smokers undergoing Surgery for Lung Cancer.

Human airways are continuously colonized by microaspiration of microbiota. Less is known about the presence, origin and composition of microbiota in the lung parenchyma. In a study of 13 patients undergoing surgery for peripheral lung cancer microbiota composition was comparatively evaluated in upper airway, lower airway and lung tissue samples using 16S rDNA analysis. Bacterial density decreased stepwise from upper to lower airways and tissue. On a taxonomic level upper and lower airway microbiota were similar whereas lung tissue showed marked dissimilarities compared to lower airways that may reflect different environmental conditions shaping local microbiota and host immunity.

## Calcium Bioavailability of Opuntia ficus-indica Cladodes in an Ovariectomized Rat Model of Postmenopausal Bone Loss.

Osteoporosis is a disease of the skeletal system characterized by low bone mass and bone weakening, which increase the risk of fracture. This disease is associated with menopause because hypoestrogenism induces the maturation and activation of osteoclasts. In addition, a low dietary intake of calcium leads to low bone mineral density and postmenopausal osteoporosis. The objectives of this work were to determine calcium bioavailability of Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes at a late maturity stage and to assess its contribution in improving bone health in an ovariectomized rat model. Two-month-old Wistar female rats (n = 35) were used and distributed in seven experimental groups: (i) control group (Crtl), (ii) sham group (SH), (iii) ovariectomized group (OVX), (iv) ovariectomized group supplemented with calcium citrate (CCa), (v) ovariectomized group supplemented with O. ficus-indica powder (NI), (vi) ovariectomized group supplemented with soluble fiber from O. ficus-indica (FS) and (vii) ovariectomized group supplemented with insoluble fiber from O. ficus-indica (FI). Our results showed that calcium in the soluble fiber of O. ficus-indica is bioavailable and contributes to improve the physical, densitometric, biomechanical and microstructural properties of bones in ovariectomized rats. These findings indicated that O. ficus-indica cladodes at a late maturity stage represent a good source of bioavailable calcium and consumption of these cladodes might be beneficial for the prevention of osteoporosis and other bone diseases.
