Unrevealing the interplay between diet, the microbiome, and the health state could enable the design of personalized intervention strategies and improve the health and well-being of individuals. A common approach to this is to divide the study population into smaller cohorts based on dietary preferences in the hope of identifying specific microbial signatures. However, classification of patients based solely on diet is unlikely to reflect the microbiome-host health relationship or the taxonomic microbiome makeup.

The microbiome-gut-brain axis plays a role in anxiety, the stress response and social development, and is of growing interest in neuropsychiatric conditions. The gut microbiota shows compositional alterations in a variety of psychiatric disorders including depression, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia but studies investigating the gut microbiome in social anxiety disorder (SAD) are very limited. Using whole-genome shotgun analysis of 49 faecal samples (31 cases and 18 sex- and age-matched controls), we analysed compositional and functional differences in the gut microbiome of patients with SAD in comparison to healthy controls. Overall microbiota composition, as measured by beta-diversity, was found to be different between the SAD and control groups and several taxonomic differences were seen at a genus- and species-level. The relative abundance of the genera Anaeromassillibacillus and Gordonibacter were elevated in SAD, while Parasuterella was enriched in healthy controls. At a species-level, Anaeromassilibacillus sp An250 was found to be more abundant in SAD patients while Parasutterella excrementihominis was higher in controls. No differences were seen in alpha diversity. In relation to functional differences, the gut metabolic module 'aspartate degradation I' was elevated in SAD patients. In conclusion, the gut microbiome of patients with SAD differs in composition and function to that of healthy controls. Larger, longitudinal studies are warranted to validate these preliminary results and explore the clinical implications of these microbiome changes.

## Analysis of the fecal metagenome in long-term survivors of pancreas cancer.

The 5-year overall survival of pancreas adenocarcinoma (PCa) remains less than 10%. Clinical and tumor genomic characteristics have not differentiated PCa long-term survivors (LTSs) from unselected patients. Preclinical studies using fecal transplant experiments from LTSs of PCa have revealed delayed tumor growth through unknown mechanisms involving the fecal microbiota. However, features of the fecal microbiome in patients with long-term survival are not well described.

## Multiomic signatures of body mass index identify heterogeneous health phenotypes and responses to a lifestyle intervention.

Multiomic profiling can reveal population heterogeneity for both health and disease states. Obesity drives a myriad of metabolic perturbations and is a risk factor for multiple chronic diseases. Here we report an atlas of cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in 1,111 blood analytes associated with variation in body mass index (BMI), as well as multiomic associations with host polygenic risk scores and gut microbiome composition, from a cohort of 1,277 individuals enrolled in a wellness program (Arivale). Machine learning model predictions of BMI from blood multiomics captured heterogeneous phenotypic states of host metabolism and gut microbiome composition better than BMI, which was also validated in an external cohort (TwinsUK). Moreover, longitudinal analyses identified variable BMI trajectories for different omics measures in response to a healthy lifestyle intervention; metabolomics-inferred BMI decreased to a greater extent than actual BMI, whereas proteomics-inferred BMI exhibited greater resistance to change. Our analyses further identified blood analyte-analyte associations that were modified by metabolomics-inferred BMI and partially reversed in individuals with metabolic obesity during the intervention. Taken together, our findings provide a blood atlas of the molecular perturbations associated with changes in obesity status, serving as a resource to quantify metabolic health for predictive and preventive medicine.

Positive associations between periodontitis (PD) and atherosclerosis have been established, but the causality and mechanisms are not clear. We aimed to explore the causal roles of PD in atherosclerosis and dissect the underlying mechanisms.

## Compartment and Plant Identity Shape Tree Mycobiome in a Subtropical Forest.

Deciphering the relationships between microbes and their host plants is critical for a better understanding of microbial diversity maintenance and community stability. Here, we investigated fungal diversity and community assembly in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of 13 tree species in a subtropical common-garden experiment. The results showed that fungal community structures significantly differed across compartments (leaf, root, and soil) and different tree species. Higher α-diversity was observed in the phyllosphere than in the roots and rhizospheric soil. Fungal community composition (β-diversity) was significantly affected by both compartment and species identity. The fungal community compositions were significantly correlated with soil pH in the roots and the soils as well as with soil nitrate and leaf total phosphorus in the leaves. We found that fungal community assemblies were mainly driven by deterministic processes, regardless of compartments. Moreover, host preference analyses indicated that stronger plant/fungus preferences occurred in leaves than in roots and soils. Our results highlight the differences in tree mycobiome between aboveground and belowground compartments and have important implications for the promotion of biodiversity conservation and management sustainability for the subtropical forest. IMPORTANCE Subtropical mountain forests are widely distributed in Southern China and are characterized by high biodiversity. The interactions between plants and fungi play pivotal roles in biodiversity maintenance and community stability. Nevertheless, knowledge of fungal diversity and of the community assembly patterns of woody plants is scarce. Here, we investigated fungal diversity and community assembly in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of 13 tree species in a common-garden experiment. We found that both compartment and plant identity influenced fungal diversity, community, and guild compositions, while deterministic processes mainly governed the fungal community assembly, especially in the rhizospheric fungal communities. Our results demonstrate that tree leaves represent stronger host/fungi preferences than do roots and soils. Together, our findings enhance the understanding of the roles of compartment and plant identity in structuring fungal communities as well as promote fungal diversity maintenance in subtropical mountain forest ecosystems.

## Gut feelings: associations of emotions and emotion regulation with the gut microbiome in women.
 21.03.2023, _S Ke, AJ Guimond, SS Tworoger, T Huang, AT Chan, YY Liu, LD Kubzansky_


Accumulating evidence suggests that positive and negative emotions, as well as emotion regulation, play key roles in human health and disease. Recent work has shown the gut microbiome is important in modulating mental and physical health through the gut-brain axis. Yet, its association with emotions and emotion regulation are understudied. Here we examined whether positive and negative emotions, as well as two emotion regulation strategies (i.e. cognitive reappraisal and suppression), were associated with the gut microbiome composition and functional pathways in healthy women.
