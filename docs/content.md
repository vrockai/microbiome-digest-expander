## The Impact of a Mediterranean Diet on the Gut Microbiome in Healthy Human Subjects: A Pilot Study.
 08.11.2021, _JJ Rejeski, FM Wilson, R Nagpal, H Yadav, RB Weinberg_


Despite the reported salutary benefits of a Mediterranean diet (MD) on a wide variety of health conditions, the specific microbial changes associated with an MD within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are not well studied. Specifically, although population and survey-based studies have shown microbial changes, there are no published data on how an MD alters the gut flora in a controlled setting.

## Altered diversity and composition of gut microbiota in patients with allergic rhinitis.
 09.11.2021, _MS Zhou, B Zhang, ZL Gao, RP Zheng, DFHM Marcellin, A Saro, J Pan, L Chu, TS Wang, JF Huang_


Recently, multiple studies have suggested an association between gut dysbiosis and allergic rhinitis (AR) development. However, the role of gut microbiota in AR development remains obscure.
