Dental implants are installed in an increasing number of patients. Mucositis and peri-implantitis are common microbial-biofilm-associated diseases affecting the tissues that surround the dental implant and are a major medical and socioeconomic burden. By metagenomic sequencing of the plaque microbiome in different peri-implant health and disease conditions (113 samples from 72 individuals), we found microbial signatures for peri-implantitis and mucositis and defined the peri-implantitis-related complex (PiRC) composed by the 7 most discriminative bacteria. The peri-implantitis microbiome is site specific as contralateral healthy sites resembled more the microbiome of healthy implants, while mucositis was specifically enriched for Fusobacterium nucleatum acting as a keystone colonizer. Microbiome-based machine learning showed high diagnostic and prognostic power for peri-implant diseases and strain-level profiling identified a previously uncharacterized subspecies of F. nucleatum to be particularly associated with disease. Altogether, we associated the plaque microbiome with peri-implant diseases and identified microbial signatures of disease severity.

## Friend or foe? The roles of inulin-type fructans.
 13.11.2020, _S Man, T Liu, Y Yao, Y Lu, L Ma, F Lu_


Inulin-type fructans (ITFs) as functional fructans and soluble dietary fiber are a mixture of inulin, oligofructose and fructooligosaccharide with β configuration. They are modified by gut microbiota at the end of ileum, subsequently, improve digestive system, metabolic syndrome, immune system and inflammatory diseases, and prevent against infection and cancer. However, it has been reported that inadequate consumption of ITFs aggravates the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, results in gastrointestinal symptoms, liver cancer and intestinal inflammation. Therefore, this review summarizes the health benefits, pharmaceutical applications and safety evaluation of ITFs, which would direct their rational applications.

## The haybiome: Characterising the viable bacterial community profile of four different hays for horses following different pre-feeding regimens.
 17.11.2020, _S Daniels, J Hepworth, M Moore-Colyer_


Respirable dust in conserved forages can pose problems with equid respiratory health, thus soaking (W) and high temperature steaming (HTS) are employed to reduce the levels in hay. The aim of this study was to characterize the viable bacterial community profile of four hays from two different locations in UK following pre-feeding wetting regimens. Hypothesis: (1) Viable microbial community profile of hays will not differ between different pre-feeding regimens. (2) Hay type and location will not influence microbial community profile. Replicates of each of the four hays were subjected to dry (D), HTS conducted in a HG600, W by submergence in 45 L tap water, 16°C for 12 hours. From each post-treated hay, 100 g samples were chopped and half (n = 36) treated with Propidium monoazide dye, the remaining half untreated. Bacterial DNA were extracted for profiling the V4-V5 region of 16S rRNA gene from all 72 samples, then sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Bioinformatics were conducted using QIIME pipeline (v1.9.1). Linear discriminate analysis effect size (LEfSe) was used to identify differences in operational taxonomic units and predicted metabolic pathways between hays and regimens. HTS reduced proportions of microbiota compared to W and D hay (P &lt; 0.001, df 3, F 13.91), viability was reduced within regimens (P = 0.017, df 1, F 5.73). Soaking reduced diversity within and between regimens. Core bacterial communities differed between hays and regimens, however pre-feeding regimen had the greatest effect on the bacterial community profile. W and HTS reduced viable bacteria (P&lt; 0.05) known to cause respiratory disease, for HTS both respiratory and dental disease, with the greatest reductions overall from HTS without reducing bacterial diversity. Soaking increased Gram-negative bacteria and reduced bacterial diversity. Collectively these findings add to a body of evidence that suggest HTS is the most suitable pre-feeding regimen of hay for equid health.

## Value of Probiotics in Canine and Feline Gastroenterology.
 16.11.2020, _SS Schmitz_


Probiotics/or synbiotics products for small animals do not fulfill the criteria required to qualify as a probiotic. Studies explaining modes of action are lacking. Outcome measures are inconsistent, with some trials assessing only nonspecific routine diagnostic parameters or fecal scores. Preliminary evidence shows that specific preparations are beneficial in parvovirus infections and acute hemorrhagic diarrhea syndrome in dogs and in Tritrichomonas fetus infection in cats. In dogs, inflammatory bowel disease specific probiotics can decrease clinical severity. More studies focusing on functional outcomes in dogs and cats with well-defined diseases to allow evidence-based clinical use of probiotics and synbiotics are needed.

## Massive gene presence-absence variation shapes an open pan-genome in the Mediterranean mussel.
 17.11.2020, _M Gerdol, R Moreira, F Cruz, J Gómez-Garrido, A Vlasova, U Rosani, P Venier, MA Naranjo-Ortiz, M Murgarella, S Greco, P Balseiro, A Corvelo, L Frias, M Gut, T Gabaldón, A Pallavicini, C Canchaya, B Novoa, TS Alioto, D Posada, A Figueras_


The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is an ecologically and economically relevant edible marine bivalve, highly invasive and resilient to biotic and abiotic stressors causing recurrent massive mortalities in other bivalves. Although these traits have been recently linked with the maintenance of a high genetic variation within natural populations, the factors underlying the evolutionary success of this species remain unclear.

## Metagenomic assessment of the global distribution of bacteria and fungi.
 13.11.2020, _M Bahram, T Netherway, C Frioux, P Ferretti, LP Coelho, S Geisen, P Bork, F Hildebrand_


Bacteria and fungi are of uttermost importance in determining environmental and host functioning. Despite close interactions between animals, plants, their associated microbiomes, and the environment they inhabit, the distribution and role of bacteria and especially fungi across host and environments as well as the cross-habitat determinants of their community compositions remain little investigated. Using a uniquely broad global dataset of 13,483 metagenomes, we analyzed the microbiome structure and function of 25 host-associated and environmental habitats, focusing on potential interactions between bacteria and fungi. We found that the metagenomic relative abundance ratio of bacteria-to-fungi is a distinctive microbial feature of habitats. Compared to fungi, the cross-habitat distribution pattern of bacteria was more strongly driven by habitat type. Fungal diversity was depleted in host-associated communities compared with those in the environment, particularly terrestrial habitats, whereas this diversity pattern was less pronounced for bacteria. The relative gene functional potential of bacteria or fungi reflected their diversity patterns and appeared to depend on a balance between substrate availability and biotic interactions. Alongside helping to identify hotspots and sources of microbial diversity, our study provides support for differences in assembly patterns and processes between bacterial and fungal communities across different habitats.
