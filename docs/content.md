The ability of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to form biofilms, can be considered an important factor that contributes to the prevalence of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) due to the inaccessibility of the antibiotics into the highly complex structure of the biofilm. Moreover, with the appearance of antibiotic multiresistant UPEC strains, the alternatives of treatment of UTIs are less. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can be useful in the treatment of the UPEC infections due to its physicochemical properties that confer them antibacterial activity against both planktonic and biofilm structured cells. A diversity of biological methods for synthesis of AgNPs with antimicrobial activity has been widely investigated during the last decades, between these methods; the fungal-biosynthesis of AgNPs highlights as an ecofriendly, scalable and low cost method. In this study, biogenic AgNPs were synthesized with extracellular metabolites secreted by the soil fungal strain Fusarium scirpi (Ag0.5-5) by an ecofriendly, simple and efficient method. The antimicrobial activity of the biosynthesized AgNPs against UPEC was evaluated. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of biogenic AgNPs over planktonic UPEC cells was 25 mg/mL, whereas a sub-MIC concentration (7.5 mg/L) was sufficient to inhibit the UPEC-biofilm formation about a 97%, or produce the disruption of an 80% of mature UPEC-biofilms demonstrating the potential of fungal-derived AgNPs to prevent UPEC infections.

## Targeted inhibition of gut bacterial β-glucuronidase activity enhances anticancer drug efficacy.
 14.03.2020, _AP Bhatt, SJ Pellock, KA Biernat, WG Walton, BD Wallace, BC Creekmore, MM Letertre, JR Swann, ID Wilson, JR Roques, DB Darr, ST Bailey, SA Montgomery, JM Roach, MA Azcarate-Peril, RB Sartor, RZ Gharaibeh, SJ Bultman, MR Redinbo_


Irinotecan treats a range of solid tumors, but its effectiveness is severely limited by gastrointestinal (GI) tract toxicity caused by gut bacterial β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes. Targeted bacterial GUS inhibitors have been shown to partially alleviate irinotecan-induced GI tract damage and resultant diarrhea in mice. Here, we unravel the mechanistic basis for GI protection by gut microbial GUS inhibitors using in vivo models. We use in vitro, in fimo, and in vivo models to determine whether GUS inhibition alters the anticancer efficacy of irinotecan. We demonstrate that a single dose of irinotecan increases GI bacterial GUS activity in 1 d and reduces intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in 5 d, both blocked by a single dose of a GUS inhibitor. In a tumor xenograft model, GUS inhibition prevents intestinal toxicity and maintains the antitumor efficacy of irinotecan. Remarkably, GUS inhibitor also effectively blocks the striking irinotecan-induced bloom of Enterobacteriaceae in immune-deficient mice. In a genetically engineered mouse model of cancer, GUS inhibition alleviates gut damage, improves survival, and does not alter gut microbial composition; however, by allowing dose intensification, it dramatically improves irinotecan's effectiveness, reducing tumors to a fraction of that achieved by irinotecan alone, while simultaneously promoting epithelial regeneration. These results indicate that targeted gut microbial enzyme inhibitors can improve cancer chemotherapeutic outcomes by protecting the gut epithelium from microbial dysbiosis and proliferative crypt damage.

Short-chain fatty acids are processed from indigestible dietary fibers by gut bacteria and have immunomodulatory properties. Here, we investigate propionic acid (PA) in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease. Serum and feces of subjects with MS exhibited significantly reduced PA amounts compared with controls, particularly after the first relapse. In a proof-of-concept study, we supplemented PA to therapy-naive MS patients and as an add-on to MS immunotherapy. After 2 weeks of PA intake, we observed a significant and sustained increase of functionally competent regulatory T (Treg) cells, whereas Th1 and Th17 cells decreased significantly. Post-hoc analyses revealed a reduced annual relapse rate, disability stabilization, and reduced brain atrophy after 3 years of PA intake. Functional microbiome analysis revealed increased expression of Treg-cell-inducing genes in the intestine after PA intake. Furthermore, PA normalized Treg cell mitochondrial function and morphology in MS. Our findings suggest that PA can serve as a potent immunomodulatory supplement to MS drugs.

## Adjusting for age improves identification of gut microbiome alterations in multiple diseases.
 19.03.2020, _TS Ghosh, M Das, IB Jeffery, PW O'Toole_


Interaction between disease-microbiome associations and ageing has not been explored in detail. Here, using age/region-matched sub-sets, we analysed the gut microbiome differences across five major diseases in a multi-cohort dataset constituting more than 2500 individuals from 20 to 89 years old. We show that disease-microbiome associations display specific age-centric trends. Ageing-associated microbiome alterations towards a disease-like configuration occur in colorectal cancer patients, thereby masking disease signatures. We identified a microbiome disease response shared across multiple diseases in elderly subjects that is distinct from that in young/middle-aged individuals, but also a novel set of taxa consistently gained in disease across all age groups. A subset of these taxa was associated with increased frailty in subjects from the ELDERMET cohort. The relevant taxa differentially encode specific functions that are known to have disease associations.

## Environmental remodeling of human gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome in livestock farms.

Anthropogenic environments have been implicated in enrichment and exchange of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria. Here we study the impact of confined and controlled swine farm environments on temporal changes in the gut microbiome and resistome of veterinary students with occupational exposure for 3 months. By analyzing 16S rRNA and whole metagenome shotgun sequencing data in tandem with culture-based methods, we show that farm exposure shapes the gut microbiome of students, resulting in enrichment of potentially pathogenic taxa and antimicrobial resistance genes. Comparison of students' gut microbiomes and resistomes to farm workers' and environmental samples revealed extensive sharing of resistance genes and bacteria following exposure and after three months of their visit. Notably, antibiotic resistance genes were found in similar genetic contexts in student samples and farm environmental samples. Dynamic Bayesian network modeling predicted that the observed changes partially reverse over a 4-6 month period. Our results indicate that acute changes in a human's living environment can persistently shape their gut microbiota and antibiotic resistome.

## Altering Routine Intensive Care Unit Practices to Support Commensalism.
 19.03.2020, _LA Hamilton, ML Behal_


The gastrointestinal (GI) tract consists of trillions of organisms that support multiple functions in the body, from immunity, digestion, and absorption to drug metabolism. These microbes form an overall collection of microorganisms that form the body's microbiome. In critical illness, many of these functions are aberrant, and the microbiome is altered, leading to untoward effects. Some of the most common medications received by patients include antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors, which affect particular changes in the microbiome. In addition, patients receiving prolonged enteral and parenteral nutrition experience changes in the microbiological composition and diversity of their GI tracts. Research is ongoing to characterize the crosstalk between the microbiome and immune function as targets for drug and nutrition therapy.

## Household Pet Ownership and the Microbial Diversity of the Human Gut Microbiota.
 20.03.2020, _AE Kates, O Jarrett, JH Skarlupka, A Sethi, M Duster, L Watson, G Suen, K Poulsen, N Safdar_


The human gut microbiome has a great deal of interpersonal variation due to both endogenous and exogenous factors, like household pet exposure. To examine the relationship between having a pet in the home and the composition and diversity of the adult gut microbiome, we conducted a case-control study nested in a larger, statewide study, the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin. Stool samples were collected from 332 participants from unique households and analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. One hundred and seventy-eight participants had some type of pet in the home with dogs and cats being the most prevalent. We observed no difference in alpha and beta diversity between those with and without pets, though seven OTUs were significantly more abundant in those without pets compared to those with pets, and four were significantly more abundant in those with pets. When stratifying by age, seven of these remained significant. These results suggest that pet ownership is associated with differences in the human gut microbiota. Further research is needed to better characterize the effect of pet ownership on the human gut microbiome.

## Assessing the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic VSL#3 for active ulcerative colitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
 17.03.2020, _X Dang, M Xu, D Liu, D Zhou, W Yang_


Fecal microbiota transplantation is an effective treatment for many gastrointestinal diseases, such as Clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis. Changes in colonic microflora may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and improvements in the intestinal microflora may relieve the disease. Fecal bacterial transplants and oral probiotics are becoming important ways to relieve active ulcerative colitis.

## Subgingival Host-Microbial Interactions in Hyperglycemic Individuals.
 16.03.2020, _PS Kumar, MF Monteiro, SM Dabdoub, GL Miranda, MZ Casati, FV Ribeiro, FR Cirano, SP Pimentel, RCV Casarin_


Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an established risk factor for periodontitis, yet its contribution to creating host-bacterial disequilibrium in the subgingival crevice is poorly understood. The present investigation aimed to quantify the impact of hyperglycemia on host-bacterial interactions in established periodontitis and to map shifts in these dynamics following mechanical nonsurgical therapy. Seventeen T2DM and 17 non-T2DM subjects with generalized severe chronic periodontitis were recruited along with 20 periodontally healthy individuals. Subjects with periodontitis were treated with scaling and root planing (SRP). Samples of subgingival biofilm and gingival crevicular fluid were collected at baseline and at 1-, 3-, and 6 mo postoperatively. Correlations were generated between 13.7 million 16S ribosomal DNA sequences and 8 immune mediators. Intermicrobial and host-microbial interactions were modeled using differential network analysis. Periodontal health was characterized by a sparse interbacterial and highly connected cytokine-bacterial network, while both normoglycemics and T2DM subjects with periodontitis demonstrated robust congeneric and intergeneric hubs but significantly fewer cytokine-bacterial connections. Following SRP, the cytokine-bacterial edges demonstrated a 2-fold increase 1 mo postoperatively and a 10-fold increase at 6 mo in normoglycemics. In hyperglycemics, there was a doubling at 1 mo but no further changes thereafter. These shifts accompanied an increasingly sparse interbacterial network. In normoglycemics, the nodes anchored by interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and IL-10 demonstrated greatest rewiring, while in hyperglycemics, IL-1β, IL-6, INF-γ, and IL-17 exhibited progressive rewiring. Thus, the present investigation points to a breakdown in host-bacterial mutualism in periodontitis, with interbacterial interactions rather than host-bacterial interactions primarily determining community assembly. Hyperglycemia further exacerbates this uncoupled mutualism. Our data also demonstrate that while nonsurgical therapy might not consistently alter microbial abundances or lower proinflammatory molecules, it "reboots" the interaction between the immunoinflammatory system and the newly colonizing microbiome, restoring a role for the immune system in determining bacterial colonization. However, this outcome is lower and delayed in hyperglycemics.

Human milk is known to carry its own microbiota, of which the precise origin remains obscure. Breast-feeding allows mother-to-baby transmission of microorganisms as well as transfer of many other milk components, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which act as metabolizable substrates for particular bacteria, such as bifidobacteria, residing in infant intestinal tract. In the current study, we report HMO composition of 249 human milk samples, in 163 of which we quantified the abundance of members of the Bifidobacterium genus using a combination of metagenomic and flow cytometric approaches. Metagenomic data allowed us to identify four clusters dominated by Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium crudilactis, or Bifidobacterium dentium, as well as a cluster represented by a heterogeneous mix of bifidobacterial species such as Bifidobacterium breve and Bifidobacterium longum. Furthermore, in vitro growth assays on HMOs coupled with in silico glycobiome analyses allowed us to elucidate that members of the Bifidobacterium bifidum and B. breve species exhibit the highest ability to degrade and grow on HMOs. Altogether these findings indicate that the bifidobacterial component of the human milk microbiota is not strictly correlated to their ability to metabolize HMOs.

## Effects of intestinal flora on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of aspirin in high-altitude hypoxia.
 12.03.2020, _Y Sun, J Zhang, A Zhao, W Li, Q Feng, R Wang_


Since hypobaric hypoxia significantly affects metabolic characteristics of intestinal flora, which plays an important role in the biotransformation of aspirin, high altitudes may influence the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic effects of aspirin in the intestines. In the present study, to test alterations of intestinal microbiota at high altitude comparing to that at low altitude, we analyzed rat feces from plain group and high-altitude group by 16S rRNA analysis. To detect concentrations of aspirin and salicylic acid, we established a reliable liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method to measure aspirin and salicylic acid concentrations in fecal suspensions and plasma. Our study found that the plateau hypoxic environment caused a significant increase in Bacteroides in rat feces, while Corynebacterium, Prevotella, and Coprococcus were declined. In addition, compared with the plain group, the metabolic activity of fecal suspensions from the plateau group on aspirin was significantly reduced. More importantly, these changes in the intestinal microbiota led to increasing absorption of aspirin in the rats after rapidly ascent to the plateau, and a reduction in the pharmacodynamic index TXB2, which would possibly result in bleeding. In conclusion, our research provides new ideas for changes in plateau pharmacokinetics, and then guide the corresponding reduction in aspirin dose for the population quickly entering the plateau.

Evaluating the health and function of the gastrointestinal tract can be challenging in all species, but is especially difficult in horses due to their size and length of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Isolation of mRNA of cells exfoliated from the GI mucosa into feces (i.e., the exfoliome) offers a novel means of non-invasively examining the gene expression profile of the GI mucosa. This approach has been utilized in people with colorectal cancer. Moreover, we have utilized this approach in a murine model of GI inflammation and demonstrated that the exfoliome reflects the tissue transcriptome. The ability of the equine exfoliome to provide non-invasive information regarding the health and function of the GI tract is not known. The objective of this study was to characterize the gene expression profile found in exfoliated intestinal epithelial cells from normal horses and compare the exfoliome data with the tissue mucosal transcriptome. Mucosal samples were collected from standardized locations along the GI tract (i.e. ileum, cecum, right dorsal colon, and rectum) from four healthy horses immediately following euthanasia. Voided feces were also collected. RNA isolation, library preparation, and RNA sequencing was performed on fecal and intestinal mucosal samples. Comparison of gene expression profiles from the tissue and exfoliome revealed correlation of gene expression. Moreover, the exfoliome contained reads representing the diverse array of cell types found in the GI mucosa suggesting the equine exfoliome serves as a non-invasive means of examining the global gene expression pattern of the equine GI tract.

We hypothesized that supplementation of nursery and grower pig diets with coconut oil in the absence of antibiotics would yield maintenance of glucose homeostasis, growth performance, and immune function similar to what is achieved with nursery and grower pig diets containing antibiotics. Pigs received the same base treatment diets from d24 (weaning) to d71 of age and had blood and fecal samples collected on d24, d31, d45 and d71 for measurement of whole blood glucose, serum insulin, cortisol and cytokines, and fecal microbiome. Pigs had weekly weights and daily feed consumption measured throughout the study. Animals were euthanized at d71 and subcutaneous fat and ileal contents were collected for assessment for fatty acids and microbiome, respectively. Diet treatments consisted of 2% soybean oil plus antibiotics (ABX; n = 22), 2% soybean oil without antibiotics (NABX; n = 22), and 2% coconut oil without antibiotics (COC; n = 22). Statistical analysis examined the effect of diet within each timepoint using a repeated measures ANOVA.

## Isoflavone supplementation, via red clover hay, alters the rumen microbial community and promotes weight gain of steers grazing mixed grass pastures.
 16.03.2020, _BE Harlow, MD Flythe, IA Kagan, JP Goodman, JL Klotz, GE Aiken_


Biochanin A, an isoflavone present in the pasture legume red clover (Trifloium pratense L.), alters fermentation in the rumen of cattle and other ruminants. Biochanin A inhibits hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria and promotes cellulolytic bacteria and fiber catalysis in vitro and ex vivo. Consequently, biochanin A supplementation improves weight gain in grazing steers. Red clover contains biologically active isoflavones that may act synergistically. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate the effect of two levels of red clover hay on growth performance and the microbial community in growing steers grazing mixed grass pastures. A grazing experiment was conducted over 2 early growing seasons (2016 and 2017) with 36 cross-bred steers and twelve rumen-fistulated, growing Holstein steers for evaluation of average daily gain and rumen microbiota, respectively. Steers were blocked by body weight and assigned to pastures with one of four treatments: 1) pasture only, 2) pasture + dry distillers' grains (DDG), 3) pasture + DDG + low level of red clover hay (~15% red clover diet), or 4) pasture + DDG + high level of red clover hay (~30% red clover diet). DDG were added to treatments to meet protein requirements and to balance total protein supplementation between treatments. All supplementation strategies (DDG ± red clover hay) increased average daily gains in comparison to pasture-only controls (P &lt; 0.05), with a low level of red clover supplementation being the most effective (+0.17 kg d-1 &gt; DDG only controls; P &lt; 0.05). Similarly, hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria inhibition (10-100-fold; P &lt; 0.05), fiber catalysis (+10-25%; P &lt; 0.05) and short chain fatty acid concentrations were greatest with the low red clover supplement (+~25%; P &lt; 0.05). These results provide evidence that lower levels or red clover supplementation may be optimal for maximizing overall microbial community function and animal performance in grazing steers.

## Integrative analysis of gut microbiome and metabolites revealed novel mechanisms of intestinal Salmonella carriage in chicken.
 17.03.2020, _KKZ Mon, Y Zhu, G Chanthavixay, C Kern, H Zhou_


Intestinal carriage of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) in the chicken host serves as a reservoir for transmission of Salmonella to humans through the consumption of poultry products. The aim of the current study was to examine the three-way interaction that occurred between host metabolites, resident gut microbiota and Salmonella following inoculation of SE in two-week-old layer chicks. Our results revealed an overall alteration in gut microbiome and metabolites in association with SE infection. Enriched colonization by different microbial members throughout the course of experimental infection highlighted significant fluctuation in the intestinal microbial community in response to Salmonella infection. As changes in community membership occurred, there was also subsequent impact on differential regulation of interlinked predicted functional activities within the intestinal environment dictated by Salmonella-commensal interaction. Alteration in the overall microbial community following infection also has a ripple effect on the host regulation of cecum-associated metabolic networks. The findings showed that there was differential regulation in many of the metabolites in association with SE colonization in chickens. Perturbation in metabolic pathways related to arginine and proline metabolism as well as TCA cycle was most prominently detected. Taken together, the present findings provided a starting point in understanding the effect of intestinal Salmonella carriage on the microbiome and metabolome of developing young layer chicks.

## Context-dependent dynamics lead to the assembly of functionally distinct microbial communities.
 19.03.2020, _LS Bittleston, M Gralka, GE Leventhal, I Mizrahi, OX Cordero_


Niche construction through interspecific interactions can condition future community states on past ones. However, the extent to which such history dependency can steer communities towards functionally different states remains a subject of active debate. Using bacterial communities collected from wild pitchers of the carnivorous pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, we test the effects of history on composition and function across communities assembled in synthetic pitcher plant microcosms. We find that the diversity of assembled communities is determined by the diversity of the system at early, pre-assembly stages. Species composition is also contingent on early community states, not only because of differences in the species pool, but also because the same species have different dynamics in different community contexts. Importantly, compositional differences are proportional to differences in function, as profiles of resource use are strongly correlated with composition, despite convergence in respiration rates. Early differences in community structure can thus propagate to mature communities, conditioning their functional repertoire.

Resident soil microbiota play key roles in sustaining the core ecosystem processes of terrestrial Antarctica, often involving unique taxa with novel functional traits. However, the full scope of biodiversity and the niche-neutral processes underlying these communities remain unclear. In this study, we combine multivariate analyses, co-occurrence networks and fitted species abundance distributions on an extensive set of bacterial, micro-eukaryote and archaeal amplicon sequencing data to unravel soil microbiome patterns of nine sites across two east Antarctic regions, the Vestfold Hills and Windmill Islands. To our knowledge, this is the first microbial biodiversity report on the hyperarid Vestfold Hills soil environment.

## Origin of volatile organic compound emissions from subarctic tundra under global warming.

_Arctic Regions, Ecosystem, Global Warming, Tundra, Volatile Organic Compounds_
Warming occurs in the Arctic twice as fast as the global average, which in turn leads to a large enhancement in terpenoid emissions from vegetation. Volatile terpenoids are the main class of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that play crucial roles in atmospheric chemistry and climate. However, the biochemical mechanisms behind the temperature-dependent increase in VOC emissions from subarctic ecosystems are largely unexplored. Using 13 CO2 -labeling, we studied the origin of VOCs and the carbon (C) allocation under global warming in the soil-plant-atmosphere system of contrasting subarctic heath tundra vegetation communities characterized by dwarf shrubs of the genera Salix or Betula. The projected temperature rise of the subarctic summer by 5°C was realistically simulated in sophisticated climate chambers. VOC emissions strongly depended on the plant species composition of the heath tundra. Warming caused increased VOC emissions and significant changes in the pattern of volatiles toward more reactive hydrocarbons. The 13 C was incorporated to varying degrees in different monoterpene and sesquiterpene isomers. We found that de novo monoterpene biosynthesis contributed to 40%-44% (Salix) and 60%-68% (Betula) of total monoterpene emissions under the current climate, and that warming increased the contribution to 50%-58% (Salix) and 87%-95% (Betula). Analyses of above- and belowground 12/13 C showed shifts of C allocation in the plant-soil systems and negative effects of warming on C sequestration by lowering net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and increasing C loss as VOCs. This comprehensive analysis provides the scientific basis for mechanistically understanding the processes controlling terpenoid emissions, required for modeling VOC emissions from terrestrial ecosystems and predicting the future chemistry of the arctic atmosphere. By changing the chemical composition and loads of VOCs into the atmosphere, the current data indicate that global warming in the Arctic may have implications for regional and global climate and for the delicate tundra ecosystems.

## Deep-sea corals provide new insight into the ecology, evolution, and the role of plastids in widespread apicomplexan symbionts of anthozoans.
 20.03.2020, _SA Vohsen, KE Anderson, AM Gade, HR Gruber-Vodicka, RP Dannenberg, EO Osman, N Dubilier, CR Fisher, IB Baums_


Apicomplexans are the causative agents of major human diseases such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. A novel group of apicomplexans, recently named corallicolids, have been detected in corals inhabiting tropical shallow reefs. These apicomplexans may represent a transitional lifestyle between free-living phototrophs and obligate parasites. To shed light on the evolutionary history of apicomplexans and to investigate their ecology in association with corals, we screened scleractinians, antipatharians, alcyonaceans, and zoantharians from shallow, mesophotic, and deep-sea communities. We detected corallicolid plastids using 16S metabarcoding, sequenced the nuclear 18S rRNA gene of corallicolids from selected samples, assembled and annotated the plastid and mitochondrial genomes from a corallicolid that associates with a deep-sea coral, and screened the metagenomes of four coral species for corallicolids.

 14.03.2020, _R Lu, M Shang, YG Zhang, Y Jiao, Y Xia, S Garrett, D Bakke, C Bäuerl, GP Martinez, CH Kim, SM Kang, J Sun_


Probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been used in the anti-inflammation and anti-infection process of various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays an essential role in pathogenesis of IBD and infectious diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that the human VDR gene is a key host factor to shape gut microbiome. Furthermore, intestinal epithelial VDR conditional knockout (VDRΔIEC) leads to dysbiosis. Low expressions of VDR is associated with impaired autophagy, accompanied by a reduction of ATG16L1 and LC3B. The purpose of this study is to investigate probiotic effects and mechanism in modulating the VDR-autophagy pathways.

## Consumption of Fermented Foods Is Associated with Systematic Differences in the Gut Microbiome and Metabolome.
 18.03.2020, _BC Taylor, F Lejzerowicz, M Poirel, JP Shaffer, L Jiang, A Aksenov, N Litwin, G Humphrey, C Martino, S Miller-Montgomery, PC Dorrestein, P Veiga, SJ Song, D McDonald, M Derrien, R Knight_


Lifestyle factors, such as diet, strongly influence the structure, diversity, and composition of the microbiome. While we have witnessed over the last several years a resurgence of interest in fermented foods, no study has specifically explored the effects of their consumption on gut microbiota in large cohorts. To assess whether the consumption of fermented foods is associated with a systematic signal in the gut microbiome and metabolome, we used a multi-omic approach (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and untargeted mass spectrometry) to analyze stool samples from 6,811 individuals from the American Gut Project, including 115 individuals specifically recruited for their frequency of fermented food consumption for a targeted 4-week longitudinal study. We observed subtle but statistically significant differences between consumers and nonconsumers in beta diversity as well as differential taxa between the two groups. We found that the metabolome of fermented food consumers was enriched with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a putatively health-promoting molecule. Cross-omic analyses between metagenomic sequencing and mass spectrometry suggest that CLA may be driven by taxa associated with fermented food consumers. Collectively, we found modest yet persistent signatures associated with fermented food consumption that appear present in multiple -omic types which motivate further investigation of how different types of fermented food impact the gut microbiome and overall health.IMPORTANCE Public interest in the effects of fermented food on the human gut microbiome is high, but limited studies have explored the association between fermented food consumption and the gut microbiome in large cohorts. Here, we used a combination of omics-based analyses to study the relationship between the microbiome and fermented food consumption in thousands of people using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. We found that fermented food consumers have subtle differences in their gut microbiota structure, which is enriched in conjugated linoleic acid, thought to be beneficial. The results suggest that further studies of specific kinds of fermented food and their impacts on the microbiome and health will be useful.

## Differential Microbial Composition of Monovarietal and Blended Extra Virgin Olive Oils Determines Oil Quality During Storage.
 18.03.2020, _BA Zullo, G Ciafardini_


Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) contains a biotic fraction, which is characterized by various microorganisms, including yeasts. The colonization of microorganisms in the freshly produced EVOO is determined by the physicochemical characteristics of the product. The production of blended EVOO with balanced taste, which is obtained by blending several monovarietal EVOOs, modifies the original microbiota of each oil due to the differential physico-chemical characteristics of the blended oil. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of microbial composition on the stability of the quality indices of the monovarietal and blended EVOOs derived from Leccino, Peranzana, Coratina, and Ravece olive varieties after six months of storage. The yeasts survived only in the monovarietal EVOOs during six months of storage. Barnettozyma californica, Candida adriatica, Candida diddensiae, and Yamadazyma terventina were the predominant yeast species, whose abundance varied in the four monovarietal EVOOs. However, the number of yeasts markedly decreased during the first three months of storage in all blended EVOOs. Thus, all blended EVOOs were more stable than the monovarietal EVOOs as the abundance and activity of microorganisms were limited during storage.

## Honey bees harbor a diverse gut virome engaging in nested strain-level interactions with the microbiota.
 17.03.2020, _G Bonilla-Rosso, T Steiner, F Wichmann, E Bexkens, P Engel_


The honey bee gut microbiota influences bee health and has become an important model to study the ecology and evolution of microbiota-host interactions. Yet, little is known about the phage community associated with the bee gut, despite its potential to modulate bacterial diversity or to govern important symbiotic functions. Here we analyzed two metagenomes derived from virus-like particles, analyzed the prevalence of the identified phages across 73 bacterial metagenomes from individual bees, and tested the host range of isolated phages. Our results show that the honey bee gut virome is composed of at least 118 distinct clusters corresponding to both temperate and lytic phages and representing novel genera with a large repertoire of unknown gene functions. We find that the phage community is prevalent in honey bees across space and time and targets the core members of the bee gut microbiota. The large number and high genetic diversity of the viral clusters seems to mirror the high extent of strain-level diversity in the bee gut microbiota. We isolated eight lytic phages that target the core microbiota member Bifidobacterium asteroides, but that exhibited different host ranges at the strain level, resulting in a nested interaction network of coexisting phages and bacterial strains. Collectively, our results show that the honey bee gut virome consists of a complex and diverse phage community that likely plays an important role in regulating strain-level diversity in the bee gut and that holds promise as an experimental model to study bacteria-phage dynamics in natural microbial communities.

## FORENSIC: an Online Platform for Fecal Source Identification.
 18.03.2020, _A Roguet, ÖC Esen, AM Eren, RJ Newton, SL McLellan_


Sewage overflows, agricultural runoff, and stormwater discharges introduce fecal pollution into surface waters. Distinguishing these sources is critical for evaluating water quality and formulating remediation strategies. With the falling costs of sequencing, microbial community-based water quality assessment tools are under development. However, their application is limited by the need to build reference libraries, which requires extensive sampling of sources and bioinformatic expertise. Here, we introduce FORest Enteric Source IdentifiCation (FORENSIC; https://forensic.sfs.uwm.edu/), an online, library-independent source tracking platform based on random forest classification and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences to identify in environmental samples common fecal contamination sources, including humans, domestic pets, and agricultural animals. FORENSIC relies on a broad reference signature database of Bacteroidales and Clostridiales, two predominant bacterial groups that have coevolved with their hosts. As a result, these groups demonstrate cohesive and reliable assemblage patterns within mammalian species or among species sharing the same diet/physiology. We created a scalable and extensible platform that we tested for global applicability using samples collected in distant geographic locations. This Web application offers a fast and intuitive approach for fecal source identification, particularly in sewage-contaminated waters.IMPORTANCE FORENSIC is an online platform to identify sources of fecal pollution without the need to create reference libraries. FORENSIC is based on the ability of random forest classification to extract cohesive source microbial signatures to create classifiers despite individual variability and to detect the signatures in environmental samples. We primarily focused on defining sewage signals, which are associated with a high human health risk in polluted waters. To test for fecal contamination sources, the platform only requires paired-end reads targeting the V4 or V6 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We demonstrated that we could use V4V5 reads trimmed to the V4 positions to generate the reference signature. The systematic workflow we describe to create and validate the signatures could be applied to many disciplines. With the increasing gap between advancing technology and practical applications, this platform makes sequence-based water quality assessments accessible to the public health and water resource communities.

## Accurate and complete genomes from metagenomes.
 19.03.2020, _LX Chen, K Anantharaman, A Shaiber, AM Eren, JF Banfield_


Genomes are an integral component of the biological information about an organism; thus, the more complete the genome, the more informative it is. Historically, bacterial and archaeal genomes were reconstructed from pure (monoclonal) cultures, and the first reported sequences were manually curated to completion. However, the bottleneck imposed by the requirement for isolates precluded genomic insights for the vast majority of microbial life. Shotgun sequencing of microbial communities, referred to initially as community genomics and subsequently as genome-resolved metagenomics, can circumvent this limitation by obtaining metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs); but gaps, local assembly errors, chimeras, and contamination by fragments from other genomes limit the value of these genomes. Here, we discuss genome curation to improve and, in some cases, achieve complete (circularized, no gaps) MAGs (CMAGs). To date, few CMAGs have been generated, although notably some are from very complex systems such as soil and sediment. Through analysis of about 7000 published complete bacterial isolate genomes, we verify the value of cumulative GC skew in combination with other metrics to establish bacterial genome sequence accuracy. The analysis of cumulative GC skew identified potential misassemblies in some reference genomes of isolated bacteria and the repeat sequences that likely gave rise to them. We discuss methods that could be implemented in bioinformatic approaches for curation to ensure that metabolic and evolutionary analyses can be based on very high-quality genomes.

## RapidAIM: a culture- and metaproteomics-based Rapid Assay of Individual Microbiome responses to drugs.
 19.03.2020, _L Li, Z Ning, X Zhang, J Mayne, K Cheng, A Stintzi, D Figeys_


Human-targeted drugs may exert off-target effects or can be repurposed to modulate the gut microbiota. However, our understanding of such effects is limited due to a lack of rapid and scalable assay to comprehensively assess microbiome responses to drugs. Drugs and other compounds can drastically change the overall abundance, taxonomic composition, and functions of a gut microbiome.

## Marketplace shrimp mislabeling in North Carolina.
 12.03.2020, _ML Korzik, HM Austin, B Cooper, C Jasperse, G Tan, E Richards, ET Spencer, B Steinwand, FJ Fodrie, JF Bruno_


Seafood mislabeling occurs in a wide range of seafood products worldwide, resulting in public distrust, economic fraud, and health risks for consumers. We quantified the extent of shrimp mislabeling in coastal and inland North Carolina. We used standard DNA barcoding procedures to determine the species identity of 106 shrimp sold as "local" by 60 vendors across North Carolina. Thirty-four percent of the purchased shrimp was mislabeled, and surprisingly the percentage did not differ significantly between coastal and inland counties. One third of product incorrectly marketed as "local" was in fact whiteleg shrimp: an imported and globally farmed species native to the eastern Pacific, not found in North Carolina waters. In addition to the negative ecosystem consequences of shrimp farming (e.g., the loss of mangrove forests and the coastal buffering they provide), North Carolina fishers-as with local fishers elsewhere-are negatively impacted when vendors label farmed, frozen, and imported shrimp as local, fresh, and wild-caught.
