The maintenance of human health is dependent on a symbiotic relationship between humans and associated bacteria. The diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes vary widely among body areas and among them the oral microbiome plays a key role. Significant changes in the oral cavity, predominantly at salivary and periodontal level, have been associated with changes in estrogen levels. However, whether the oral microbiome is affected by hormonal level alterations is understudied. Hence the main objective pursued by AMICA project was to characterize the oral microbiome (saliva) in healthy women through: profiling studies using "omics" technologies (NMR-based metabolomics, targeted lipidomics by LC-MS, metagenomics by NGS); SinglePlex ELISA assays; glycosidase activity analyses and bioinformatic analysis. For this purpose, thirty-nine medically healthy women aged 26-77 years (19 with menstrual cycle and 20 in menopause) were recruited. Participants completed questionnaires assessing detailed medical and medication history and demographic characteristics. Plasmatic and salivary levels of sexual hormones were assessed (FSH, estradiol, LH and progesteron) at day 3 and 14 for women with menstrual cycle and only once for women in menopause. Salivary microbiome composition was assessed through meta-taxonomic 16S sequencing and overall, the salivary microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle and in menopause. Targeted lipidomics and untargeted metabolomics profiling were assessed through the use of LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy technologies, respectively and significant changes in terms of metabolites were identified in saliva of post-menopausal women in comparison to cycle. Moreover, glycosyl hydrolase activities were screened and showed that the β-D-hexosaminidase activity was the most present among those analyzed. Although this study has not identified significant alterations in the composition of the oral microbiome, multiomics analysis have revealed a strong correlation between 2-AG and α-mannosidase. In conclusion, the use of a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the oral microbiome of healthy women provided some indication about microbiome-derived predictive biomarkers that could be used in the future for developing new strategies to help to re-establish the correct hormonal balance in post-menopausal women.
