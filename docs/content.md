Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are characterized by an unusual phenotype and developmental pathway, yet their specific ligands and functions remain largely unknown. Here by analysis of QFL T cells, a population of CD8+ T cells critical for monitoring the MHC I antigen processing pathway, we established that unconventional Qa-1b-restricted CD8+ T cells are abundant in intestinal epithelium. We found that QFL T cells showed a Qa-1b-dependent unconventional phenotype in the spleen and small intestine of naïve wild-type mice. The splenic QFL T cells showed innate-like functionality exemplified by rapid response to cytokines or antigens, while the gut population was refractory to stimuli. Microbiota was required for the maintenance, but not the initial gut homing of QFL T cells. Moreover, monocolonization with Pediococcus pentosaceus, which expresses a peptide that cross-activated QFL T cells, was sufficient to maintain QFL T cells in the intestine. Thus, microbiota is critical for shaping the Qa-1b-restricted IEL landscape.

Akkermansia muciniphila is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, which represents a part of the commensal human microbiota. Decline in the abundance of A. muciniphila among other microbial species in the gut correlates with severe systemic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer. Due to its mucin-reducing and immunomodulatory properties, the use of probiotics containing Akkermansia sp. appears as a promising approach to the treatment of metabolic and inflammatory diseases. In particular, a number of studies have focused on the role of A. muciniphila in colorectal cancer. Of note, the results of these studies in mice are contradictory: some reported a protective role of A. muciniphila in colorectal cancer, while others demonstrated that administration of A. muciniphila could aggravate the course of the disease resulting in increased tumor burden. More recent studies suggested the immunomodulatory effect of certain unique surface antigens of A. muciniphila on the intestinal immune system. In this Perspective, we attempt to explain how A. muciniphila contributes to protection against colorectal cancer in some models, while being pathogenic in others. We argue that differences in the experimental protocols of administration of A. muciniphila, as well as viability of bacteria, may significantly affect the results. In addition, we hypothesize that antigens presented by pasteurized bacteria or live A. muciniphila may exert distinct effects on the barrier functions of the gut. Finally, A. muciniphila may reduce the mucin barrier and exerts combined effects with other bacterial species in either promoting or inhibiting cancer development.

## Association between erythrocyte membrane fatty acids and gut bacteria in obesity-related cognitive dysfunction.
 23.12.2023, _T Zhao, H Huang, J Li, J Shen, C Zhou, R Xiao, W Ma_


Obesity increases the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, and the gut microbiota can affect brain cognitive function and obesity through a variety of pathways such as the gut-brain axis. This study aimed to discover how fatty acid affect cognitive function by regulating intestinal flora in obesity. Obese subjects were recruited for cognitive function assessment, and participants were divided into obese group with cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 49) and obese cognitively normal group (Non_MCI, n = 55). In the erythrocyte membrane, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6) and arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6) and n-6/n-3 ratio was higher in the MCI group than in the Non_MCI group. However, the α-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) percentage of the erythrocyte membrane was lower in the MCI group. We found that Coriobacteriales_Incertae_Sedis was positively correlated with erythrocyte membrane C20:4 n-6 and n-6 PUFA and negatively correlated with cognitive scores in obese patients. In addition, several of the functional pathways we predicted were significantly different in the MCI and Non_MCI groups. Higher levels of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio in the erythrocyte membranes may influence the inflammatory response in the organism causing obesity induced cognitive damage. Moreover, high levels of n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio may also affect the intestinal flora of obese patients, which in turn may affect the cognitive function of obese patients.

Although mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are generally safe and effective, in certain immunocompromised individuals they can elicit poor immunogenic responses. Among these individuals, people living with HIV (PLWH) have poor immunogenicity to several oral and parenteral vaccines. As the gut microbiome is known to affect vaccine immunogenicity, we investigated whether baseline gut microbiota predicts immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in healthy controls and PLWH after two doses of BNT162b2. Individuals with high spike IgG titers and high spike-specific CD4+ T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 showed low α-diversity in the gut. Here, we investigated and presented initial evidence that the gut microbial composition influences the response to BNT162b2 in PLWH. From our predictive models, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium appeared to be microbial markers of individuals with higher spike IgG titers, while Cloacibacillus was associated with low spike IgG titers. We therefore propose that microbiome modulation could optimize immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.

Recent evidence suggests a crucial role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa (AN). In this study, we carried out a series of multiple analyses of the gut microbiota of hospitalized individuals with AN over three months using 16S or 23S rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology (YIF-SCAN®), which is highly sensitive and enables the precise quantification of viable microorganisms. Despite the weight gain and improvements in psychological features observed during treatment, individuals with AN exhibited persistent gut microbial dysbiosis over the three-month duration. Principal component analysis further underscored the distinct microbial profile of individuals with AN, compared with that of age-matched healthy women at all time points. Regarding the kinetics of bacterial detection, the detection rate of Lactiplantibacillus spp. significantly increased after inpatient treatment. Additionally, the elevation in the Bifidobacterium counts during inpatient treatment was significantly correlated with the subsequent body weight gain after one year. Collectively, these findings suggest that gut dysbiosis in individuals with AN may not be easily restored solely through weight gain, highlighting the potential of therapeutic interventions targeting microbiota via dietary modifications or live biotherapeutics.

## Gut microbiome-based machine learning for diagnostic prediction of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
 22.12.2023, _X Liu, D Liu, C Tan, W Feng_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Liver Cirrhosis, Fibrosis, Machine Learning_
Invasive detection methods such as liver biopsy are currently the gold standard for diagnosing liver cirrhosis and can be used to determine the degree of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. In contrast, non-invasive diagnostic methods, such as ultrasonography, elastography, and clinical prediction scores, can prevent patients from invasiveness-related discomfort and risks and are often chosen as alternative or supplementary diagnostic methods for liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. However, these non-invasive methods cannot specify the pathological grading and early diagnosis of the lesions. Recent studies have revealed that gut microbiome-based machine learning can be utilized as a non-invasive diagnostic technique for liver cirrhosis or fibrosis, but there is no evidence-based support. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for the first time to investigate the accuracy of machine learning based on the gut microbiota in the prediction of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.

## Targeting gut microbial nitrogen recycling and cellular uptake of ammonium to improve bortezomib resistance in multiple myeloma.

The gut microbiome has been found to play a crucial role in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), which is still considered incurable due to drug resistance. In previous studies, we demonstrated that intestinal nitrogen-recycling bacteria are enriched in patients with MM. However, their role in MM relapse remains unclear. This study highlights the specific enrichment of Citrobacter freundii (C. freundii) in patients with relapsed MM. Through fecal microbial transplantation experiments, we demonstrate that C. freundii plays a critical role in inducing drug resistance in MM by increasing levels of circulating ammonium. The ammonium enters MM cells through the transmembrane channel protein SLC12A2, promoting chromosomal instability and drug resistance by stabilizing the NEK2 protein. We show that furosemide sodium, a loop diuretic, downregulates SLC12A2, thereby inhibiting ammonium uptake by MM cells and improving progression-free survival and curative effect scores. These findings provide new therapeutic targets and strategies for the intervention of MM progression and drug resistance.

It was found that with the increase of drug use years, the content of tryptamine associated with neuropsychiatric disorders gradually increased. The prediction models based on oral microbiome and metabolome could effectively predict the methamphetamine (METH) smoking. Our study provides novel insights into the exploration of the molecular mechanisms regulating the toxic damage and addiction of METH as well as new ideas for early prevention and treatment strategies of METH addiction.

## Heterogeneous associations of gut microbiota with Crohn's disease activity.
 21.12.2023, _S Pinto, E Benincà, G Galazzo, D Jonkers, J Penders, JA Bogaards_


_Humans, Crohn Disease, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Inflammation, Bacteria, Bacteroidetes_
The multi-factorial involvement of gut microbiota with Crohn's disease (CD) necessitates robust analysis to uncover possible associations with particular microbes. CD has been linked to specific bacteria, but reported associations vary widely across studies. This inconsistency may result from heterogeneous associations across individual patients, resulting in no apparent or only weak relationships with the means of bacterial abundances. We investigated the relationship between bacterial relative abundances and disease activity in a longitudinal cohort of CD patients (n = 57) and healthy controls (n = 15). We applied quantile regression, a statistical technique that allows investigation of possible relationships outside the mean response. We found several significant and mostly negative associations with CD, especially in lower quantiles of relative abundance on family or genus level. Associations found by quantile regression deviated from the mean response in relative abundances of Coriobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Ruminococcaceae. For the family Streptococcaceae we found a significant elevation in relative abundance for patients experiencing an exacerbation relative to those who remained without self-reported symptoms or measurable inflammation. Our analysis suggests that specific bacterial families are related to CD and exacerbation, but associations vary between patients due to heterogeneity in disease course, medication history, therapy response, gut microbiota composition and historical contingency. Our study underscores that microbial diversity is reduced in the gut of CD patients, but suggests that the process of diversity loss is rather irregular with respect to specific taxonomic groups. This novel insight may advance our ecological understanding of this complex disease.

## Wheat fungal endophyte communities are inseparable from the host and influence plant development.
 22.12.2023, _O Sharon, N Kagan-Trushina, A Sharon_


The native microbiome in a given plant must be considered when evaluating the effect of a single taxon or synthetic community. The pre-existing microbiome can interact with artificially added microbial cargo, which affects the final outcome. Such issues can be at least partially solved by the use of endophyte-free plants, which provide a clean background that should be useful in determining the effect of a single taxon, taxa combinations, or the entire microbiome on plant performance. Previous reports regarded plants as endophyte-free or axenic by the lack of fungal growth on culture media or the generation of plants from tissue cultures. We showed here that while fungi could not be isolated from fungicide-treated or tissue culture-regenerated plants, nevertheless, all plants contained rich fungal endophyte communities; namely, it was impossible to create fungi-free wheat plants. Our results call for rethinking fundamental microbiome-related concepts, such as core taxa, transmission mode, and functional species.

## Metagenomics-Based Microbial Ecological Community Threshold and Indicators of Anthropogenic Disturbances in Estuarine Sediments.
 20.12.2023, _Y Bao, Y Ruan, J Wu, WX Wang, KMY Leung, PKH Lee_


Assessing the impacts of cumulative anthropogenic disturbances on estuarine ecosystem health is challenging. Using spatially distributed sediments from the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in southern China, which are significantly influenced by anthropogenic activities, we demonstrated that metagenomics-based surveillance of benthic microbial communities is a robust approach to assess anthropogenic impacts on estuarine benthic ecosystems. Correlational and threshold analyses between microbial compositions and environmental conditions indicated that anthropogenic disturbances in the PRE sediments drove the taxonomic and functional variations in the benthic microbial communities. An ecological community threshold of anthropogenic disturbances was identified, which delineated the PRE sediments into two groups (H and L) with distinct taxa and functional traits. Group H, located nearshore and subjected to a higher level of anthropogenic disturbances, was enriched with pollutant degraders, putative human pathogens, fecal pollution indicators, and functional traits related to stress tolerance. In contrast, Group L, located offshore and subjected to a lower level of anthropogenic disturbances, was enriched with halotolerant and oligotrophic taxa and functional traits related to growth and resource acquisition. The machine learning random forest model identified a number of taxonomic and functional indicators that could differentiate PRE sediments between Groups H and L. The identified ecological community threshold and microbial indicators highlight the utility of metagenomics-based microbial surveillance in assessing the adverse impacts of anthropogenic disturbances in estuarine sediments, which can assist environmental management to better protect ecosystem health.

## Nine (not so simple) steps: a practical guide to using machine learning in microbial ecology.
 21.12.2023, _C Walsh, E Stallard-Olivera, N Fierer_


Due to the complex nature of microbiome data, the field of microbial ecology has many current and potential uses for machine learning (ML) modeling. With the increased use of predictive ML models across many disciplines, including microbial ecology, there is extensive published information on the specific ML algorithms available and how those algorithms have been applied. Thus, our goal is not to summarize the breadth of ML models available or compare their performances. Rather, our goal is to provide more concrete and actionable information to guide microbial ecologists in how to select, run, and interpret ML algorithms to predict the taxa or genes associated with particular sample categories or environmental gradients of interest. Such microbial data often have unique characteristics that require careful consideration of how to apply ML models and how to interpret the associated results. This review is intended for practicing microbial ecologists who may be unfamiliar with some of the intricacies of ML models. We provide examples and discuss common opportunities and pitfalls specific to applying ML models to the types of data sets most frequently collected by microbial ecologists.

## Examining the functional space of gut microbiome-derived peptides.
 25.12.2023, _YJ Lee_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Microbiota, Host Microbial Interactions, Peptides, Anti-Infective Agents_
The human gut microbiome contains thousands of small, novel peptides that could play a role in microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions, contributing to human health and disease. Although these peptides have not yet been systematically characterized, computational tools can be used to elucidate the bioactivities they may have. This article proposes probing the functional space of gut microbiome-derived peptides (MDPs) using in silico approaches for three bioactivities: antimicrobial, anticancer, and nucleomodulins. Machine learning programs that support peptide and protein queries are provided for each bioactivity. Considering the biases of an activity-centric approach, activity-agnostic tools using structural and chemical similarity and target prediction are also described. Gut MDPs represent a vast functional space that can not only contribute to our understanding of microbiome interactions but potentially even serve as a source of life-changing therapeutics.

## A new absolute quantitative method for peptide and metabolite detection.
 19.12.2023, _C Brogna, S Cristoni_


_Humans, Research Design, Arginine, Bacterial Proteins, Calibration, Peptides_
Mass spectrometry is widely employed in various analytical fields for both compound identification and quantification. While in the case of compound identification, the high-resolution instrument has increased selectivity and characterization efficiency; in the case of quantitative analysis, some critical tasks actually remain. In particular, different compounds exhibit different ionization efficiency, and this introduces the need to have a calibration standard for each analyte. In this paper, we present a new elaborative data technology, which makes it possible to standardize calibration between different instruments and molecules, making it absolute. The method was applied to data acquired by means of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry by means of an ion trap analyzer. The approach is based on the correlation of the ion trap space charge effect and the analyte concentration. The method was validated in the analysis of compounds having different polarity: hydrossitirosol, arginine, thyodiglicolic acid, and a peptide mixture of bacteria cultures derived the human gut microbiome where was found poliovirus. Moreover, it was used to obtain the absolute quantitation of peptides originating from the tryptic digestion of bacterial proteins in the fecal samples. It was therefore possible to identify and quantify different derived bacterial proteins of the poliomyelitis virus coded in bacteria derived from the gastrointestinal tract.
