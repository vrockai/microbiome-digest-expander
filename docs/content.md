## The Microbiota-Gut-Immune-Glia (MGIG) Axis in Major Depression.
 23.07.2020, _L Rudzki, M Maes_


There is robust evidence that major depression (MDD) is accompanied by a low-grade activation of the immune-inflammatory response system, which is involved in the pathophysiology of this disorder. It is also becoming apparent that glia cells are in reciprocal communication with neurons, orchestrate various neuromodulatory, homeostatic, metabolic, and immune mechanisms, and have a crucial role in neuroinflammatory mechanisms in MDD. Those cells mediate the central nervous system (CNS) response to systemic inflammation and psychological stress, but at the same time, they may be an origin of the inflammatory response in the CNS. The sources of activation of the inflammatory response in MDD are immense; however, in recent years, it is becoming increasingly evident that the gastrointestinal tract with gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and increased intestinal permeability to bacterial LPS and food-derived antigens contribute to activation of low-grade inflammatory response with subsequent psychiatric manifestations. Furthermore, an excessive permeability to gut-derived antigenic material may lead to subsequent autoimmunities which are also known to be comorbid with MDD. In this review, we discuss fascinating interactions between the gastrointestinal tract, increased intestinal permeability, intestinal microbiota, and glia-neuron cross talk, and their roles in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory hypothesis of MDD. To emphasize those crucial intercommunications for the brain functions, we propose the term of microbiota-gut-immune-glia (MGIG) axis.

## Engineering the gut microbiota to treat chronic diseases.
 22.07.2020, _NS Dosoky, LS May-Zhang, SS Davies_


Gut microbes play vital roles in host health and disease. A number of commensal bacteria have been used as vectors for genetic engineering to create living therapeutics. This review highlights recent advances in engineering gut bacteria for the treatment of chronic diseases such as metabolic diseases, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, and autoimmune disorders. KEY POINTS: • Bacterial homing to tumors has been exploited to deliver therapeutics in mice models. • Engineered bacteria show promise in mouse models of metabolic diseases. • Few engineered bacterial treatments have advanced to clinical studies.

## Acute and chronic improvement in postprandial glucose metabolism by a diet resembling the traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern: Can SCFAs play a role?
 23.07.2020, _M Vitale, R Giacco, M Laiola, G Della Pepa, D Luongo, A Mangione, D Salamone, P Vitaglione, D Ercolini, AA Rivellese_


Postprandial metabolic abnormalities are considered important and independent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. However, the effects of the Mediterranean diet on postprandial metabolism and the mechanism underpinning the effects on clinical variables have not been exhaustively explored. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to evaluate the acute and medium-term effects (8 weeks) on postprandial glucose and lipid metabolism of a diet resembling a typical Mediterranean diet (Med-D) compared to a western-type diet (Control-D), and the mechanisms underlying those effects.

## Enterobacterales Infection after Intestinal Dominance in Hospitalized Patients.
 23.07.2020, _K Rao, A Seekatz, C Bassis, Y Sun, E Mantlo, MA Bachman_


The Enterobacterales order of Gram-negative bacteria includes the common nosocomial pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Enterobacter species. Intestinal domination by some colonizing bacterial taxa is associated with subsequent infection, but 16S rRNA gene sequencing is too costly and slow to be used in a clinical setting. The objectives of this study were to develop a PCR-based assay that can measure Enterobacterales density, validate it against 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and measure the association between Enterobacterales dominance and subsequent infection. Two quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays that were developed to quantify the absolute and relative abundance of Enterobacterales had good correlation with 16S rRNA sequence analysis (P &lt; 0.0001). Using both PCR assays and 16S sequencing, a matched case-control study was performed comparing rectal swabs from hospitalized patients who later developed bloodstream, urinary tract, or respiratory Enterobacterales infections (n = 95) to swabs from patients who remained uninfected (n = 189). Enterobacterales abundance measured by sequencing was high in both cases and controls (means, 31.1% and 27.5%, respectively; P = 0.322). We observed an increased risk of infection that depended on both the absolute and relative abundance of Enterobacterales as measured by qPCR assay A (P = 0.012). After adjustment for albumin levels, central venous catheter presence, and use of cephalosporins at the time of swab collection, this association still approached significance (P = 0.061). These results demonstrate that using qPCR to measure intestinal colonization dominance is feasible, indicate that hospitalized patients have high levels of Enterobacterales colonization, and suggest that both relative and absolute abundance may be associated with subsequent infection.IMPORTANCE Increasing antibiotic resistance has resulted in infections that are life-threatening and difficult to treat. Interventions that prevent these infections, particularly without using antibiotics, could save lives. Intestinal colonization by pathogens, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (part of the order Enterobacterales) is associated with subsequent infection, and increased colonization density is associated with increased infection risk. Therefore, colonization offers a window of opportunity for infection prevention if (i) there are rapid and inexpensive assays to detect colonization, (ii) there are safe and effective interventions, and (iii) the risk of infection outweighs the risk of the treatment. Fecal transplants are proof of principle that manipulating the microbiome can reduce such colonization and prevent infections. This study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing rapid and inexpensive assays to quantify colonization and measures the strength of association between Enterobacterales dominance and subsequent infection. The approach described here could be a valuable tool in the prevention of antibiotic-resistant infections.

## Differences in the gut Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio across age groups in healthy Ukrainian population.
 23.07.2020, _A Vaiserman, M Romanenko, L Piven, V Moseiko, O Lushchak, N Kryzhanovska, V Guryanov, A Koliada_


Gut microbiota plays an important role in physiological and pathological processes of the host organism, including aging. Microbiota composition was shown to vary significantly throughout the life course. Age-related changes in the composition of microbiota were reported in several human studies. In present study, age-related dynamics of phylogenetic profile of gut microbiota was investigated in 1550 healthy participants from Ukrainian population.

human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are an important component of human milk supporting the development of a balanced intestinal microbiota and immune protection in breastfed infants. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that infant formulas supplemented with the HMOs 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) are safe, well-tolerated, and support normal growth. This Real-World Evidence (RWE) study aimed to evaluate growth and tolerance in infants consuming a formula supplemented with 1 g/L of 2'FL and 0.5 g/L of LNnT, and included a mixed-feeding group never studied before in RCTs.

## Gut microbiome composition differences among breeds impact feed efficiency in swine.
 23.07.2020, _M Bergamaschi, F Tiezzi, J Howard, YJ Huang, KA Gray, C Schillebeeckx, NP McNulty, C Maltecca_


Feed efficiency is a crucial parameter in swine production, given both its economic and environmental impact. The gut microbiota plays an essential role in nutrient digestibility and is, therefore, likely to affect feed efficiency. This study aimed to characterize feed efficiency, fatness traits, and gut microbiome composition in three major breeds of domesticated swine and investigate a possible link between feed efficiency and gut microbiota composition.

## Local Necrotic Cells Trigger Systemic Immune Activation via Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis in Drosophila.
 22.07.2020, _H Kosakamoto, T Yamauchi, Y Akuzawa-Tokita, K Nishimura, T Soga, T Murakami, H Mori, K Yamamoto, R Miyazaki, A Koto, M Miura, F Obata_


Necrotic cells elicit an inflammatory response through their endogenous factors with damage-associated molecular patterns. Blocking apoptosis in Drosophila wings leads to the necrosis-driven systemic immune response by unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that immune activation in response to necrotic cells is mediated by commensal gut microbiota. Removing the microbiome attenuates hyperactivation of the innate immune signaling IMD pathway in necrosis-induced flies. Necrotic cells in wings trigger Gluconobacter expansion in the gut. An isolated Gluconobacter sp. strain is sufficient for pathological IMD activation in necrosis-induced flies, while it is not inflammatory for control animals. In addition, bacterial colonization shifts the host metabolome and shortens the lifespan of necrosis-induced flies. This study shows that local necrosis triggers a pathological systemic inflammatory response through interaction between the host and the dysbiotic gut microbiome.

## Peanut skin extract ameliorates the symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus in mice by alleviating inflammation and maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis.
 23.07.2020, _L Xiang, Q Wu, H Osada, M Yoshida, W Pan, J Qi_


In this study, mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) induced by high-fat diet were used to investigate the antidiabetic effect and mechanism of action of peanut skin extract (PSE). Results revealed that the fasting blood glucose, body weight, and food intake of mice with T2DM significantly decreased after they were given PSE. The effects of 80 mg/kg PSE were similar to those of 140 mg/kg metformin (MET). The glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity of the mice also improved. The composition of intestinal microflora in the mice significantly changed after PSE administration. In particular, no Actinobacteria was detected in the PSE-treated group, and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced. PSE also increased the abundance of gut microbiota involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis, and sucrose metabolism. The abundance of gut microbiota related to aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis also decreased. Lipopolysaccharide, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in the blood, liver and adipose tissue were reduced by PSE. Similarly, the mRNA expression levels of IkappaB kinase and nuclear factor kappaB in the hypothalamus were reduced by PSE. These results suggested that PSE and MET elicited significant antidiabetic effects by maintaining gut microbiota and inhibiting inflammation.
