## The role of the gut microbiota in regulating responses to vaccination: current knowledge and future directions.
 05.08.2024, _C Rossouw, FJ Ryan, DJ Lynn_


Antigen-specific B and T cell responses play a critical role in vaccine-mediated protection against infectious diseases, but these responses are highly variable between individuals and vaccine immunogenicity is frequently sub-optimal in infants, the elderly and in people living in low- and middle-income countries. Although many factors such as nutrition, age, sex, genetics, environmental exposures, and infections may all contribute to variable vaccine immunogenicity, mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is an important and targetable factor shaping optimal immune responses to vaccination. In this review, we discuss evidence from human, preclinical and experimental studies supporting a role for a healthy gut microbiota in mediating optimal vaccine immunogenicity, including the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the potential mechanisms through which this could occur and discuss strategies that could be used to target the microbiota to boost vaccine immunogenicity where it is currently sub-optimal.

Elevated systemic antibody responses against gut microbiota flagellins are observed in both Crohn's disease (CD) and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), suggesting potential serological biomarkers for diagnosis. However, flagellin-specific antibody repertoires and functional roles in the diseases remain incompletely understood. Bacterial flagellins can be categorized into three types depending on their interaction with toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5): (1) "stimulator" and (2) "silent" flagellins, which bind TLR5 through a conserved N-terminal motif, with only stimulators activating TLR5 (involving a C-terminal domain); (3) "evader" flagellins of pathogens, which entirely circumvent TLR5 activation via mutations in the N-terminal TLR5 binding motif.

## Diet at birth is critical for healthy growth, independent of effects on the gut microbiota.

Colostrum is the first milk for a newborn. Its high content in microbiota shaping compounds and its intake at the time of gut microbiota seeding suggests colostrum may be critical in the establishment of a healthy microbiota. There is also accumulating evidence on the importance of the gut microbiota for healthy growth. Here, we aimed to investigate the contribution of colostrum, and colostrum-induced microbiota to growth promotion. Addressing this question is highly significant because (1) globally, less than half of the newborns are fully colostrum fed (2) the evidence for the importance of the microbiota for the prevention of undernutrition has only been demonstrated in juvenile or adult pre-clinical models while stunting already starts before weaning.

## Association of breast milk-derived arachidonic acid-induced infant gut dysbiosis with the onset of atopic dermatitis.

The specific breast milk-derived metabolites that mediate host-microbiota interactions and contribute to the onset of atopic dermatitis (AD) remain unknown and require further investigation.
