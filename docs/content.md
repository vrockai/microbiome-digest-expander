This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## Knowledge and practice of obstetric care providers on prevention of obstetric fistula 2023: an institution-based cross-sectional study.
 15.12.2023, _SS Alemu, MT Agago, EY Ukumo, TS Hadero_


Obstetric fistula is a preventable devastating condition that is mostly caused by obstructed labour. About 22% of obstructed labor is complicated by obstetric fistula. Skilled birth attendants during delivery are essential for the prevention of obstetric fistula. However, little is known about the status of the knowledge and practice of obstetric fistula prevention in the Gamo zone.

## Psychosocial impact of recurrent urogenital infections: a review.
 15.12.2023, _K Thomas-White, P Navarro, F Wever, L King, LR Dillard, J Krapf_


Recurrent urogenital infections such as bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and urinary tract infections have a high prevalence and pronounced psychosocial impact. However, no review has compared the psychosocial impacts across infection types. This narrative review discusses the impact of common recurrent urogenital infections on psychosocial aspects, including quality of life, stress, mental health, sexual health, work productivity, race and ethnicity, and satisfaction of medical care. Validated questionnaires show that women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and urinary tract infections have decreased scores on all aspects of quality of life. Those with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and urinary tract infections show lower mental health scores compared to the general population, with increased risk of anxiety and depression. Recurrent urogenital infections affect sexual relationships and intimacy, including avoidance due to symptoms or as a method of prevention. Recurrent infections also increase medical cost and negatively affect work productivity, leading to a combined estimated cost of over US$13 billion per year. There are clear effects of racial inequality involving minority populations that affect diagnosis, treatment, prevalence, and reporting of recurrent urogenital infections. Satisfactory medical treatment improves quality of life and mental health in those suffering from these conditions. Research evaluating psychosocial aspects of recurrent urogenital infections is variable and is not comparable across vulvovaginal conditions. Even so, psychosocial factors are important in understanding contribution and consequence of urogenital infections. Education, awareness, normalization, community support, and access to care can help to alleviate the negative implications of recurrent urogenital infections.
