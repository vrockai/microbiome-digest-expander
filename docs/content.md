Variation in the human gut microbiome can reflect host lifestyle and behaviors and influence disease biomarker levels in the blood. Understanding the relationships between gut microbes and host phenotypes are critical for understanding wellness and disease. Here, we examine associations between the gut microbiota and ~150 host phenotypic features across ~3,400 individuals. We identify major axes of taxonomic variance in the gut and a putative diversity maximum along the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes axis. Our analyses reveal both known and unknown associations between microbiome composition and host clinical markers and lifestyle factors, including host-microbe associations that are composition-specific. These results suggest potential opportunities for targeted interventions that alter the composition of the microbiome to improve host health. By uncovering the interrelationships between host diet and lifestyle factors, clinical blood markers, and the human gut microbiome at the population-scale, our results serve as a roadmap for future studies on host-microbe interactions and interventions.

Poor diet and lifestyle exposures are implicated in substantial global increases in non-communicable disease burden in low-income, remote, and Indigenous communities. This observational study investigated the contribution of the fecal microbiome to influence host physiology in two Indigenous communities in the Torres Strait Islands: Mer, a remote island where a traditional diet predominates, and Waiben a more accessible island with greater access to takeaway food and alcohol. Counterintuitively, disease markers were more pronounced in Mer residents. However, island-specific differences in disease risk were explained, in part, by microbiome traits. The absence of Alistipes onderdonkii, for example, significantly (p=0.014) moderated island-specific patterns of systolic blood pressure in multivariate-adjusted models. We also report mediatory relationships between traits of the fecal metagenome, disease markers, and risk exposures. Understanding how intestinal microbiome traits influence response to disease risk exposures is critical for the development of strategies that mitigate the growing burden of cardiometabolic disease in these communities.

## Seasonal variation in the gut microbiota of rhesus macaques inhabiting limestone forests of southwest Guangxi, China.

Data on the gut microbiota of animals can provide new insights into dietary ecology of hosts, consequently assisting in understanding their adaptation strategy and evolutionary potential. We studied the gut microbiota composition and function of the wild rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) using 16S rRNA sequencing method. Our results revealed that the gut microbiota of the wild rhesus macaques was dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes. Diversity and richness of gut microbiota were higher during the dry season than the rainy season. Specifically, higher proportions of Firmicutes, Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, and unclassified bacteria at the phylum level and more Coprococcus at the genus level were detected in the dry season. Predictive functional analysis showed that pathways associated with carbohydrate metabolism and drug resistance (antimicrobial and antineoplastic) were richer in the dry season. These seasonal differences in microbiota could be due to their heavier dependence on leaf-based diet in the dry season. Additionally, macaques in limestone forests had a higher percentage of Spirochaetes, probably suggesting that the proportion of fruits in dietary composition also play an important role in the gut microbiota. We concluded that diet was strongly linked to the diversity, composition, and function of the gut microbiota in the wild groups of rhesus macaques living in the limestone forest, highlighting the importance of diet in the gut microbiota of macaques and the need to conduct further study on the adaptation strategy in response of environmental changes in the ground of gut microbiota.
