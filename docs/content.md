Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, an efficacious anti-diabetic agent, which has cardiovascular and renal benefits, can promote pancreatic β-cell regeneration in type 2 diabetic mice. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to use multi-omics to identify the mediators involved in β-cell regeneration induced by dapagliflozin. We showed that dapagliflozin lowered blood glucose level, upregulated plasma insulin level, and increased islet area in db/db mice. Dapagliflozin reshaped gut microbiota, and modulated microbiotic and plasmatic metabolites related to tryptophan metabolism, especially L-tryptophan, in the diabetic mice. Notably, L-tryptophan upregulated the mRNA level of GLP-1 production-related genes (Gcg and Pcsk1) expression and promoted GLP-1 secretion in cultured mouse intestinal L-cells, and it increased supernatant insulin level in primary human islets, which was eliminated by GPR142 antagonist. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from dapagliflozin-treated mice, supplementation of L-tryptophan or treatment with dapagliflozin upregulated L-tryptophan, GLP-1, and insulin or C-peptide level, and promoted β-cell regeneration in db/db mice. Addition of exendin 9-39, a GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) antagonist, or pancreatic Glp1r knockout diminished these beneficial effects. In summary, treatment with dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetic mice promotes β-cell regeneration by upregulating GLP-1 production, which is mediated via gut microbiota and tryptophan metabolism.

## Inhibition of inosine metabolism of the gut microbiota decreases testosterone secretion in the testis.
 12.03.2024, _L Tang, X Yang, M Zhou, L Feng, C Ji, J Liang, B Zhang, R Shen, L Wang_


Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota is involved in the regulation of the host's sex hormone levels, such as through interfering with the sex hormone metabolism in the intestine. However, if gut microbiota or its metabolites directly influence the sex hormone biosynthesis in the gonad remains largely unknown. Our previous study showed that colistin, as a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, can significantly downregulate the serum testosterone levels and thus enhance the antitumor efficiency of anti-PD-L1 in male mice; however, the underlying mechanism for the regulation of the host's testosterone levels remains uninvestigated. In the present study, we analyzed the impact of colistin on the immune microenvironment of the testis as well as the composition and metabolism of gut microbiota in male mice. Our results showed that colistin has an impact on the immune microenvironment of the testis and can downregulate serum testosterone levels in male mice through inhibition of Akkermansia, leading to destroyed inosine metabolism. Supplement with inosine can restore testosterone secretion probably by prompting the recovery of the intestinal mucus barrier and the serum lipopolysaccharides levels. All these findings reveal a new pathway for the regulation of the host's sex hormone levels by gut microbiota.IMPORTANCEThis study demonstrates that exposure to even narrow-spectrum antibiotics may affect the host's testosterone levels by altering the gut microbiota and its metabolites. Our findings provide evidence that some specific gut bacteria have an impact on the sex hormone biosynthesis in the testis.

## Exploring the gut microbiota and its potential as a biomarker in gliomas.
 12.03.2024, _D Aljarrah, N Chalour, A Zorgani, T Nissan, MZI Pranjol_


Gut microbiome alterations are associated with various cancers including brain tumours such as glioma and glioblastoma. The gut communicates with the brain via a bidirectional pathway known as the gut-brain axis (GBA) which is essential for maintaining homeostasis. The gut microbiota produces many metabolites including short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and essential amino acids such as glutamate, glutamine, arginine and tryptophan. Through the modulation of these metabolites the gut microbiome is able to regulate several functions of brain cells, immune cells and tumour cells including DNA methylation, mitochondrial function, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), T-cell proliferation, autophagy and even apoptosis. Here, we summarise current findings on gut microbiome with respect to brain cancers, an area of research that is widely overlooked. Several studies investigated the relationship between gut microbiota and brain tumours. However, it remains unclear whether the gut microbiome variation is a cause or product of cancer. Subsequently, a biomarker panel was constructed for use as a predictive, prognostic and diagnostic tool with respect to multiple cancers including glioma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This review further presents the intratumoural microbiome, a fascinating microenvironment within the tumour as a possible treatment target that can be manipulated to maximise effectiveness of treatment via personalised therapy. Studies utilising the microbiome as a biomarker and therapeutic strategy are necessary to accurately assess the effectiveness of the gut microbiome as a clinical tool with respect to brain cancers.

_Humans, Neuraminidase, Ecosystem, Bacteroides fragilis, Intestinal Mucosa, Polysaccharides_
The early microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract can have long-term impacts on development and health. Keystone species, including Bacteroides spp., are prominent in early life and play crucial roles in maintaining the structure of the intestinal ecosystem. However, the process by which a resilient community is curated during early life remains inadequately understood. Here, we show that a single sialidase, NanH, in Bacteroides fragilis mediates stable occupancy of the intestinal mucosa in early life and regulates a commensal colonization program. This program is triggered by sialylated glycans, including those found in human milk oligosaccharides and intestinal mucus. NanH is required for vertical transmission from dams to pups and promotes B. fragilis dominance during early life. Furthermore, NanH facilitates commensal resilience and recovery after antibiotic treatment in a defined microbial community. Collectively, our study reveals a co-evolutionary mechanism between the host and microbiota mediated through host-derived glycans to promote stable colonization.

## Efficacy of a novel multi-enzyme feed additive on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and gut microbiome of weanling pigs fed corn-wheat or wheat-barley based diet.
 11.03.2024, _AS Aderibigbe, CS Park, T Johnson, DE Velayudhan, E Vinyeta, O Adeola_


One-hundred-and-ninety-two weanling pigs (6.7 kg BW) were used to evaluate the impact of a carbohydrases-protease enzyme complex (CPEC) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and gut microbiome. Pigs were assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments for 42 d according to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of diet type [low fiber (LF) or high fiber (HF)] and CPEC supplementation (0 or 170 mg/kg diet). The LF diet was prepared as corn-wheat-based diet while the HF diet was wheat-barley-based and contained wheat middlings and canola meal. Each dietary treatment consisted of 12 replicate pens (6 replicates per gender) and 4 pigs per replicate pen. Over the 42-d period, there was no interaction between diet type and CPEC supplementation on growth performance indices of pigs. Dietary addition of CPEC improved (P &lt; 0.05) the body weight of pigs at d 28 and d 42 and the gain-to-feed ratio of pigs from d 0 to 14. During the entire experimental period, dietary CPEC supplementation improved (P &lt; 0.05) the average daily gain and gain-to-feed ratio of pigs. There were interactions between diet type and CPEC supplementation on apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter (DM; P &lt; 0.01), gross energy (GE; P &lt; 0.01), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF; P &lt; 0.05) at d 42. Dietary CPEC addition improved (P &lt; 0.05) ATTD of DM, GE, and NDF in the HF diets. At d 43, dietary CPEC addition resulted in improved (P &lt; 0.05) apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of NDF and interactions (P &lt; 0.05) between diet type and CPEC supplementation on AID of DM and crude fiber. Alpha diversity indices including phylogenetic diversity and observed amplicon sequence variants (ASV) of fecal microbiome increased (P &lt; 0.05) by the addition of CPEC in the HF diets on d 42. An interaction (P &lt; 0.05) between diet type and CPEC addition on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and Unweighted UniFrac distances was observed at d 42. In conclusion, CPEC improved weanling pig performance and feed efficiency, especially in wheat-barley diets, while dietary fiber composition had a more significant impact on fecal microbial communities than CPEC administration. The results of this study underscores carbohydrase's potential to boost pig performance without major microbiome changes.

## Plasma Treatment Modifies Element Distribution in Seed Coating and Affects Further Germination and Plant Growth through Interaction with Soil Microbiome.
 11.03.2024, _T Kalachova, B Jindřichová, R Pospíchalová, J Fujera, A Artemenko, J Jančík, A Antonova, O Kylián, V Prukner, L Burketová, M Šimek, T Homola_


This study investigates the impact of plasma-seed interaction on germination and early plant development, focusing on Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus. The investigation delves into changes in chemical composition, water absorption, and surface morphology induced by plasma filaments generated in synthetic air. These analyses were conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Although plasma treatment enhanced water absorption and modified surface chemistry, its impact on germination demonstrated species- and context-dependent variations. Notably, the accelerated germination and morphogenesis of seedlings in microbiome-enriched (MB+) soil could be achieved also in microbiome-deprived (MB-) soil by short-term plasma treatment of seeds. Remarkably, the positive effects of plasma treatment on early developmental events (germination, morphogenesis) and later events (formation of inflorescences) were more pronounced in the context of MB- soil but were accompanied by a slight decrease in disease resistance, which was not detected in MB+ soil. The results underscore the intricate dynamics of plasma-plant interactions and stress the significance of accounting for the soil microbiome while designing experiments with potential field application.

_Arsenic, Soil, Bacteria, Genes, Bacterial, Microbiota, Soil Microbiology, Soil Pollutants_
Microbial arsenic transformations play essential roles in controlling pollution and ameliorating risk. This study combined high-throughput sequencing and PCR-based approaches targeting both the 16 S rRNA and arsenic functional genes to investigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of the soil microbiomes impacted by high arsenic contamination (9.13 to 911.88 mg/kg) and to investigate the diversity and abundance of arsenic functional genes in soils influenced by an arsenic gradient. The results showed that the soil microbiomes were relatively consistent and mainly composed of Actinobacteria (uncultured Gaiellales and an unknown_67 - 14 bacterium), Proteobacteria, Firmicutes (particularly, Bacillus), Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria (unknown_Subgroup_6). Although a range of arsenic functional genes (e.g., arsM, arsC, arrA, and aioA) were identified by shotgun metagenomics, only the arsM gene was detected by the PCR-based method. The relative abundance of the arsM gene accounted for 0.20%-1.57% of the total microbial abundance. Combining all analyses, arsenic methylation mediated by the arsM gene was proposed to be a key process involved in the arsenic biogeochemical cycle and mitigation of arsenic toxicity. This study advances our knowledge about arsenic mechanisms over the long-term in highly contaminated soils.

## Root microbiota analysis of Oryza rufipogon and Oryza sativa reveals an orientation selection during the domestication process.
 12.03.2024, _L Jiang, D Ke, B Sun, J Zhang, S Lyu, H Yu, P Chen, X Mao, Q Liu, W Chen, Z Fan, L Huang, S Yin, Y Deng, C Li_


The root-associated microbiota has a close relation to the life activities of plants, and its composition is affected by the rhizospheric environment and plant genotypes. Rice (Oryza sativa) was domesticated from the ancestor species Oryza rufipogon. Many important agricultural traits and adversity resistance of rice have changed during a long time of natural domestication and artificial selection. However, the influence of rice genotypes on root microbiota in important agricultural traits remains to be explained. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene amplicon sequencing to generate bacterial and fungal community profiles of O. rufipogon and O. sativa, both of which were planted in a farm in Guangzhou and had reached the reproductive stage. We compared their root microbiota in detail by alpha diversity, beta diversity, different species, core microbiota, and correlation analyses. We found that the relative abundance of bacteria was significantly higher in the cultivated rice than in the common wild rice, while the relative abundance of fungi was the opposite. Significant differences in agricultural traits between O. rufipogon and O. sativa showed a high correlation with core microorganisms in the two Oryza species, which only existed in either or had obviously different abundance in both two species, indicating that rice genotype/phenotype had a strong influence on recruiting specific microorganisms. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the in-depth understanding of rice root microbiota and the improvement of rice breeding from the perspective of the interaction between root microorganisms and plants.IMPORTANCEPlant root microorganisms play a vital role not only in plant growth and development but also in responding the biotic and abiotic stresses. Oryza sativa is domesticated from Oryza rufipogon which has many excellent agricultural traits especially containing resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. To improve the yield and resistance of cultivated rice, it is particularly important to deeply research on differences between O. sativa and O. rufipogon and find beneficial microorganisms to remodel the root microbiome of O. sativa.

## Sugar transporters spatially organize microbiota colonization along the longitudinal root axis of Arabidopsis.
 13.03.2024, _EP Loo, P Durán, TY Pang, P Westhoff, C Deng, C Durán, M Lercher, R Garrido-Oter, WB Frommer_


Plant roots are functionally heterogeneous in cellular architecture, transcriptome profile, metabolic state, and microbial immunity. We hypothesized that axial differentiation may also impact spatial colonization by root microbiota along the root axis. We developed two growth systems, ArtSoil and CD-Rhizotron, to grow and then dissect Arabidopsis thaliana roots into three segments. We demonstrate that distinct endospheric and rhizosphere bacterial communities colonize the segments, supporting the hypothesis of microbiota differentiation along the axis. Root metabolite profiling of each segment reveals differential metabolite enrichment and specificity. Bioinformatic analyses and GUS histochemistry indicate microbe-induced accumulation of SWEET2, 4, and 12 sugar uniporters. Profiling of root segments from sweet mutants shows altered spatial metabolic profiles and reorganization of endospheric root microbiota. This work reveals the interdependency between root metabolites and microbial colonization and the contribution of SWEETs to spatial diversity and stability of microbial ecosystem.

_Algorithms, Machine Learning, Microbiota_
Normalization, as a pre-processing step, can significantly affect the resolution of machine learning analysis for microbiome studies. There are countless options for normalization scheme selection. In this study, we examined compositionally aware algorithms including the additive log ratio (alr), the centered log ratio (clr), and a recent evolution of the isometric log ratio (ilr) in the form of balance trees made with the PhILR R package. We also looked at compositionally naïve transformations such as raw counts tables and several transformations that are based on relative abundance, such as proportions, the Hellinger transformation, and a transformation based on the logarithm of proportions (which we call "lognorm").

## A method to correct for local alterations in DNA copy number that bias functional genomics assays applied to antibiotic-treated bacteria.
 12.03.2024, _GJ Sullivan, L Barquist, AK Cain_


Functional genomics techniques, such as transposon insertion sequencing and RNA-sequencing, are key to studying relative differences in bacterial mutant fitness or gene expression under selective conditions. However, certain stress conditions, mutations, or antibiotics can directly interfere with DNA synthesis, resulting in systematic changes in local DNA copy numbers along the chromosome. This can lead to artifacts in sequencing-based functional genomics data when comparing antibiotic treatment to an unstressed control. Further, relative differences in gene-wise read counts may result from alterations in chromosomal replication dynamics, rather than selection or direct gene regulation. We term this artifact "chromosomal location bias" and implement a principled statistical approach to correct it by calculating local normalization factors along the chromosome. These normalization factors are then directly incorporated into statistical analyses using standard RNA-sequencing analysis methods without modifying the read counts themselves, preserving important information about the mean-variance relationship in the data. We illustrate the utility of this approach by generating and analyzing a ciprofloxacin-treated transposon insertion sequencing data set in Escherichia coli as a case study. We show that ciprofloxacin treatment generates chromosomal location bias in the resulting data, and we further demonstrate that failing to correct for this bias leads to false predictions of mutant drug sensitivity as measured by minimum inhibitory concentrations. We have developed an R package and user-friendly graphical Shiny application, ChromoCorrect, that detects and corrects for chromosomal bias in read count data, enabling the application of functional genomics technologies to the study of antibiotic stress.IMPORTANCEAltered gene dosage due to changes in DNA replication has been observed under a variety of stresses with a variety of experimental techniques. However, the implications of changes in gene dosage for sequencing-based functional genomics assays are rarely considered. We present a statistically principled approach to correcting for the effect of changes in gene dosage, enabling testing for differences in the fitness effects or regulation of individual genes in the presence of confounding differences in DNA copy number. We show that failing to correct for these effects can lead to incorrect predictions of resistance phenotype when applying functional genomics assays to investigate antibiotic stress, and we provide a user-friendly application to detect and correct for changes in DNA copy number.
