## The SAMBA tool uses long reads to improve the contiguity of genome assemblies.
 04.02.2022, _AV Zimin, SL Salzberg_


Third-generation sequencing technologies can generate very long reads with relatively high error rates. The lengths of the reads, which sometimes exceed one million bases, make them invaluable for resolving complex repeats that cannot be assembled using shorter reads. Many high-quality genome assemblies have already been produced, curated, and annotated using the previous generation of sequencing data, and full re-assembly of these genomes with long reads is not always practical or cost-effective. One strategy to upgrade existing assemblies is to generate additional coverage using long-read data, and add that to the previously assembled contigs. SAMBA is a tool that is designed to scaffold and gap-fill existing genome assemblies with additional long-read data, resulting in substantially greater contiguity. SAMBA is the only tool of its kind that also computes and fills in the sequence for all spanned gaps in the scaffolds, yielding much longer contigs. Here we compare SAMBA to several similar tools capable of re-scaffolding assemblies using long-read data, and we show that SAMBA yields better contiguity and introduces fewer errors than competing methods. SAMBA is open-source software that is distributed at https://github.com/alekseyzimin/masurca.

## 'A landmark in psychiatric progress'? The role of evidence in the rise and fall of insulin coma therapy.
 22.12.2021, _R Freudenthal, J Moncrieff_


This paper examines the evidence behind the use and decline of insulin coma therapy as a treatment for schizophrenia and how this was viewed by the psychiatric profession. The paper demonstrates that, from the time of its introduction, there was considerable debate regarding the evidence for insulin treatment, and scepticism about its purported benefits. The randomized trials conducted in the 1950s were the result, rather than the origins, of this debate. Although insulin treatment was subsequently abandoned, it was still regarded as a historic moment in the modernization of psychiatry. Then, as now, evidence does not speak for itself, and insulin continued to be incorporated into the story of psychiatric progress even after it was shown to be ineffective.

## Dynamic of the human gut microbiome under infectious diarrhea.
 05.02.2022, _H Chung The, SH Le_


Despite the widespread implementation of sanitation, immunization and appropriate treatment, infectious diarrheal diseases still inflict a great health burden to children living in low resource settings. Conventional microbiology research in diarrhea have focused on the pathogen's biology and pathogenesis, but initial enteric infections could trigger subsequent perturbations in the gut microbiome, leading to short-term or long-term health effects. Conversely, such pre-existing perturbations could render children more vulnerable to enteropathogen colonization and diarrhea. Recent advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses have been integrated in well-designed clinical and epidemiological studies, which allow us to track how the gut microbiome changes from disease onset to recovery. Here, we aim to summarize the current understanding on the diarrheal gut microbiome, stratified into different disease stages. Furthermore, we discuss how such perturbations could have impacts beyond an acute diarrhea episode, specifically on the child's nutritional status and the facilitation of antimicrobial resistance.

## Mechanism of Dyspnea during Exercise in Children with Corrected Congenital Heart Disease.
 24.01.2022, _M Chlif, MM Ammar, NB Said, L Sergey, S Ahmaidi, F Alassery, H Hamam_


_Child, Dyspnea, Exercise, Exercise Test, Heart Defects, Congenital, Humans, Oxygen Consumption_
This study will evaluate cardiorespiratory and peripheral muscle function and their relationship with subjective dyspnea threshold after the surgical correction of congenital heart disease in children. Thirteen children with surgically repaired congenital heart disease were recruited. Each participant performed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer until exhaustion. Gas exchanges were continuously sampled to measure the maximal aerobic parameters and ventilatory thresholds. The functional capacity of the subjects was assessed with a 6 min walk test. At the end of the exercise test, isokinetic Cybex Norm was used to evaluate the strength and endurance of the knee extensor muscle in the leg. Dyspnea was subjectively scored with a visual analog scale during the last 15 s of each exercise step. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea score/VO2 relationship located at the dyspnea threshold, at which dyspnea suddenly increased. Results: The maximal and submaximal values of the parameters describing the exercise and the peripheral muscular performances were: VO2 Peak: 33.8 ± 8.9 mL·min-1·kg-1; HR: 174 ± 9 b·min-1; VEmax: 65.68 ± 15.9 L·min-1; P max: 117 ± 27 W; maximal voluntary isometric force MVIF: 120.8 ± 41.9 N/m; and time to exhaustion Tlim: 53 ± 21 s. Oxygen consumption measured at the dyspnea threshold was related to VO2 Peak (R2 = 0.74; p &lt; 0.01), Tlim (R2 = 0.78; p &lt; 0.01), and the distance achieved during the 6MWT (R2 = 0.57; p &lt; 0.05). Compared to the theoretical maximal values for the power output, VO2, and HR, the surgical correction did not repair the exercise performance. After the surgical correction of congenital heart disease, exercise performance was impeded by alterations of the cardiorespiratory function and peripheral local factors. A subjective evaluation of the dyspnea threshold is a reliable criterion that allows the prediction of exercise capacity in subjects suffering from congenital heart disease.

## A pilot feasibility study of a behavioral intervention for nicotine vaping cessation among young adults delivered via telehealth.
 05.02.2022, _AM Palmer, RL Tomko, LM Squeglia, KM Gray, MJ Carpenter, TT Smith, J Dahne, BA Toll, EA McClure_


Nicotine vaping among youth has increased, warranting concern from tobacco control proponents. Many youth who vape indicate interest in quitting; however, few empirically supported vaping cessation interventions exist. This pilot feasibility study adapted an established behavioral intervention, contingency management (CM), delivered via telehealth to promote vaping cessation among young adults.

## The adult microbiome of healthy and otitis patients: Definition of the core healthy and diseased ear microbiomes.
 28.01.2022, _M Burton, JA Krumbeck, G Wu, S Tang, A Prem, AK Gupta, TL Dawson_


Otitis media (OM) and externa (OE) are painful, recurrent ear conditions. As most otitis publications focus on the bacterial content of childhood ears, there remains a dearth of information regarding the adult ear microbiome including both bacteria and fungi. This study compares the outer ear microbiome of healthy adults to adults affected by OE and OM using both intergenic-transcribed-spacer (ITS) and 16S-rDNA sequencing. The adult ear core microbiome consists of the prokaryote Cutibacterium acnes and the eukaryotic Malassezia arunalokei, M. globosa, and M. restricta. The healthy ear mycobiome is dominated by Malassezia and can be divided into two groups, one dominated by M. arunalokei, the other by M. restricta. Microbiome diversity and biomass varied significantly between healthy and diseased ears, and analyses reveal the presence of a potential mutualistic, protective effect of Malassezia species and C. acnes. The healthy ear core microbiome includes the bacteria Staphylococcus capitis and S. capitis/caprae, while the diseased ear core is composed of known bacterial and fungal pathogens including Aspergillus sp., Candida sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Corynebacterium jeikeium. The data presented highlight the need for early detection of the cause of otitis to direct more appropriate, efficient treatments. This will improve patient outcomes and promote improved antimicrobial stewardship.

## Ecology and potential functions of plant-associated microbial communities in cold environments.
 27.01.2022, _M Marian, G Licciardello, B Vicelli, I Pertot, M Perazzolli_


_Bacteria, Ecology, Fungi, Microbiota, Plants_
Complex microbial communities are associated with plants and can improve their resilience under harsh environmental conditions. In particular, plants and their associated communities have developed complex adaptation strategies against cold stress. Although changes in plant-associated microbial community structure have been analysed in different cold regions, scarce information is available on possible common taxonomic and functional features of microbial communities across cold environments. In this review, we discuss recent advances in taxonomic and functional characterization of plant-associated microbial communities in three main cold regions, such as alpine, Arctic and Antarctica environments. Culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches are analysed, in order to highlight the main factors affecting the taxonomic structure of plant-associated communities in cold environments. Moreover, biotechnological applications of plant-associated microorganisms from cold environments are proposed for agriculture, industry and medicine, according to biological functions and cold adaptation strategies of bacteria and fungi. Although further functional studies may improve our knowledge, the existing literature suggest that plants growing in cold environments harbor complex, host-specific and cold-adapted microbial communities, which may play key functional roles in plant growth and survival under cold conditions.

## Standardized universal pulse: A fast RF calibration approach to improve flip angle accuracy in parallel transmission.
 05.02.2022, _C Le Ster, F Mauconduit, A Massire, N Boulant, V Gras_


In parallel transmission (pTX), subject-tailored RF pulses allow achieving excellent flip angle (FA) accuracy but often require computationally extensive online optimizations, precise characterization of the static field ( Δ B 0   ), and the transmit RF field ( B 1 +  ) distributions. This costs time and requires expertise from the MR user. Universal pulses (UPs) have been proposed to reduce this burden, yet, with a penalty in FA accuracy. This study introduces the concept of standardized universal pulses (SUPs), where pulses are designed offline and adjusted to the subject through a fast online calibration scan.

## Somatic PMK-1/p38 signaling links environmental stress to germ cell apoptosis and heritable euploidy.
 05.02.2022, _N Soltanmohammadi, S Wang, B Schumacher_


Inheritance of stable and euploid genomes is a prerequisite for species maintenance. The DNA damage response in germ cells controls the integrity of heritable genomes. Whether and how somatic stress responses impact the quality control of germline genomes has remained unclear. Here, we show that PMK-1/p38-mediated stress signaling in intestinal cells is required for germ cell apoptosis amid ionizing radiation (IR)-induced or meiotic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in C. elegans. We demonstrate that intestinal PMK-1/p38 signaling regulates the germ cell death in response to environmental stress. The PMK-1/p38 target SYSM-1 is secreted from the intestine into the germline to trigger apoptosis of meiotic pachytene cells. Compromised PMK-1/p38 signaling in intestinal cells leads to stress-induced aneuploidy in the consequent generation. Our data suggest that somatic stress surveillance controls heritable genome integrity and euploidy.

## McComedy: A user-friendly tool for next-generation individual-based modeling of microbial consumer-resource systems.
 24.01.2022, _A Bogdanowski, K Frank, T Banitz, LK Muhsal, C Kost_


Individual-based modeling is widely applied to investigate the ecological mechanisms driving microbial community dynamics. In such models, the population or community dynamics emerge from the behavior and interplay of individual entities, which are simulated according to a predefined set of rules. If the rules that govern the behavior of individuals are based on generic and mechanistically sound principles, the models are referred to as next-generation individual-based models. These models perform particularly well in recapitulating actual ecological dynamics. However, implementation of such models is time-consuming and requires proficiency in programming or in using specific software, which likely hinders a broader application of this powerful method. Here we present McComedy, a modeling tool designed to facilitate the development of next-generation individual-based models of microbial consumer-resource systems. This tool allows flexibly combining pre-implemented building blocks that represent physical and biological processes. The ability of McComedy to capture the essential dynamics of microbial consumer-resource systems is demonstrated by reproducing and furthermore adding to the results of two distinct studies from the literature. With this article, we provide a versatile tool for developing next-generation individual-based models that can foster understanding of microbial ecology in both research and education.
