## Maternal rumen and milk microbiota shapes the establishment of early-life rumen microbiota in grazing yak calves.

Early-life gut microbial colonization and development exert a profound impact on the health and metabolism of the host throughout the life span. The transmission of microbes from the mother to the offspring affects the succession and establishment of the early-life rumen microbiome in newborns, but the contributions of different maternal sites to the rumen microbial establishment remain unclear. In the present study, samples from different dam sites (namely, oral, rumen fluid, milk, and teat skin) and rumen fluid of yak calves were collected at 6 time points between d 7 and 180 postpartum to determine the contributions of the different maternal sites to the establishment of the bacterial and archaeal communities in the rumen during early life. Our analysis demonstrated that the dam's microbial communities clustered according to the sites, and the calves' rumen microbiota resembled that of the dam consistently regardless of fluctuations at d 7 and 14. The dam's rumen microbiota was the major source of the calves' rumen bacteria (7.9%) and archaea (49.7%) compared with the other sites, whereas the potential sources of the calf rumen microbiota from other sites varied according to the age. The contribution of dam's rumen bacteria increased with age from 0.36% at d 7 to 14.8% at d 180, whereas the contribution of the milk microbiota showed the opposite trend, with its contribution reduced from 2.7% at d 7 to 0.2% at d 180. Maternal oral archaea were the main sources of the calves' rumen archaea at d 14 (50.4%), but maternal rumen archaea became the main source gradually and reached 66.2% at d 180. These findings demonstrated the potential microbial transfer from the dam to the offspring that could influence the rumen microbiota colonization and establishment in yak calves raised under grazing regimens, providing the basis for future microbiota manipulation strategies during their early life.

## Local conditions matter: Minimal and variable effects of soil disturbance on microbial communities and functions in European vineyards.

_Soil, Farms, Soil Microbiology, Microbiota, Herbicides_
Soil tillage or herbicide applications are commonly used in agriculture for weed control. These measures may also represent a disturbance for soil microbial communities and their functions. However, the generality of response patterns of microbial communities and functions to disturbance have rarely been studied at large geographical scales. We investigated how a soil disturbance gradient (low, intermediate, high), realized by either tillage or herbicide application, affects diversity and composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities as well as soil functions in vineyards across five European countries. Microbial alpha-diversity metrics responded to soil disturbance sporadically, but inconsistently across countries. Increasing soil disturbance changed soil microbial community composition at the European level. However, the effects of soil disturbance on the variation of microbial communities were smaller compared to the effects of location and soil covariates. Microbial respiration was consistently impaired by soil disturbance, while effects on decomposition of organic substrates were inconsistent and showed positive and negative responses depending on the respective country. Therefore, we conclude that it is difficult to extrapolate results from one locality to others because microbial communities and environmental conditions vary strongly over larger geographical scales.
