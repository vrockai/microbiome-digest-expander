## Strategizing the human microbiome for small molecules: approaches and perspectives.
 26.11.2022, _A Hussain, U Patwekar, DS Mongad, YS Shouche_


Studies of the human microbiome are providing a deeper understanding of its significance to human health {AuQ: Edit OK?}, and increasing evidence links the microbiota with several diseases. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms involved in human-microbe interactions are mostly undefined. The genomic potential of the human microbiome to biosynthesize distinct molecules outmatches its known chemical space, and small-molecule discovery in this context remains in its infancy. The profiling of {AuQ: Edit OK?} microbiome-derived small molecules and their contextualization through cause-effect mechanistic studies may provide a better understanding of host-microbe interactions, guide new therapeutic interventions, and modulate microbiome-based therapies. This review describes the advances, approaches, and allied challenges in mining new microbial scaffolds from the human microbiome using genomic, microbe cultivation {AuQ: Edit OK?}, and chemical analytic platforms. In the future, the complete biological characterization of a single microbe-derived molecule that has a specific therapeutic application could resolve the current limitations of microbiota-modulating therapies.

## Timing matters: age-dependent impacts of the social environment and host selection on the avian gut microbiota.

The establishment of the gut microbiota in early life is a critical process that influences the development and fitness of vertebrates. However, the relative influence of transmission from the early social environment and host selection throughout host ontogeny remains understudied, particularly in avian species. We conducted conspecific and heterospecific cross-fostering experiments in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and Bengalese finches (Lonchura striata domestica) under controlled conditions and repeatedly sampled the faecal microbiota of these birds over the first 3 months of life. We thus documented the development of the gut microbiota and characterised the relative impacts of the early social environment and host selection due to species-specific characteristics and individual genetic backgrounds across ontogeny by using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.

## Hypomagnetic Field Exposure Affecting Gut Microbiota, Reactive Oxygen Species Levels, and Colonic Cell Proliferation in Mice.
 26.11.2022, _A Zhan, Y Luo, H Qin, W Lin, L Tian_


The gut microbiota has been considered one of the key factors in host health, which is influenced by many environmental factors. The geomagnetic field (GMF) represents one of the important environmental conditions for living organisms. Previous studies have shown that the elimination of GMF, the so-called hypomagnetic field (HMF), could affect the physiological functions and resistance to antibiotics of some microorganisms. However, whether long-term HMF exposure could alter the gut microbiota to some extent in mammals remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term (8- and 12-week) HMF exposure on the gut microbiota in C57BL/6J mice. Our results clearly showed that 8-week HMF significantly affected the diversity and function of the mouse gut microbiota. Compared with the GMF group, the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids tended to decrease in the HMF group. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that HMF promoted colonic cell proliferation, concomitant with an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo finding that long-term HMF exposure could affect the mouse gut microbiota, ROS levels, and colonic cell proliferation in the colon. Moreover, the changes in gut microbiota can be restored by returning mice to the GMF environment, thus the possible harm to the microbiota caused by HMF exposure can be alleviated. © 2022 Bioelectromagnetics Society.

## Metagenomic insights into feasibility of agricultural wastes on optimizing water quality and natural bait by regulating microbial loop.
 26.11.2022, _L Wan, L Cao, C Song, X Cao, Y Zhou_


Effective screening feed substitutes for improving water quality in aquaculture systems has become a trending research topic now. In this study, three typical organic agricultural wastes, including sugar cane bagasse (SC), coconut shell powder (CS), and corn cob powder (CC), were selected to evaluate their potential roles on the optimization of water quality and natural bait compared to aquafeeds. Fish feed resulted in the highest growth rate of fish but the worst water quality. Organic detritus addition markedly improved the water quality, especially soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP, decrease of 56-61%) and ammonium (decrease of 16% in SC, 47% in CC). Specially, SC induced core microbes to mediate nutrients transformation and recycling (N2-fixation, ammonification, nitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia and organic nutrients decomposition), which facilitated the primary productivity based on their positive relationships. This further reduced the available nutrients (especially SRP) in the water and built a mutually beneficial microbial loop. In addition, SC addition increased the abundance of genes involved in amino acids biosynthesis pathways, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation. These results led to energy transfer to higher trophic levels. The addition of CC had a better effect than SC in terms of lower nitrogen levels and a higher fish growth rate (19% in CC, 5% in SC). However, low temperatures and carbon accumulation jointly drive the anaerobic decomposition, resulting in unhealthy microbial loops and low fish growth rates. In contrast to the direct consumption of fish feed, organic detritus can induce more natural bait to provide food for fish by regulating the microbial loop, as showed by the microbial community composition in the water and fish gut. To comprehensively assess water quality, natural bait, and fish growth and quality, certain organic detritus should be considered as an auxiliary material to partially replace feed for healthy and sustainable aquaculture systems.
