_Humans, Microbiota, Metagenome_
The recent recognition of the importance of the microbiome to the host's health and well-being has yielded efforts to develop therapies that aim to shift the microbiome from a disease-associated state to a healthier one. Direct manipulation techniques of the species' assemblage are currently available, e.g., using probiotics or narrow-spectrum antibiotics to introduce or eliminate specific taxa. However, predicting the species' abundances at the new state remains a challenge, mainly due to the difficulties of deciphering the delicate underlying network of ecological interactions or constructing a predictive model for such complex ecosystems.

The gut microbiome undergoes primary ecological succession over the course of early life before achieving ecosystem stability around 3 years of age. These maturational patterns have been well-characterized for bacteria, but limited descriptions exist for other microbiota members, such as fungi. Further, our current understanding of the prevalence of different patterns of bacterial and fungal microbiome maturation and how inter-kingdom dynamics influence early-life microbiome establishment is limited.

Microbial communities at the airway mucosal barrier are conserved and highly ordered, in likelihood reflecting co-evolution with human host factors. Freed of selection to digest nutrients, the airway microbiome underpins cognate management of mucosal immunity and pathogen resistance. We show here the initial results of systematic culture and whole-genome sequencing of the thoracic airway bacteria, identifying 52 novel species amongst 126 organisms that constitute 75% of commensals typically present in heathy individuals. Clinically relevant genes encode antimicrobial synthesis, adhesion and biofilm formation, immune modulation, iron utilisation, nitrous oxide (NO) metabolism and sphingolipid signalling. Using whole-genome content we identify dysbiotic features that may influence asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We match isolate gene content to transcripts and metabolites expressed late in airway epithelial differentiation, identifying pathways to sustain host interactions with microbiota. Our results provide a systematic basis for decrypting interactions between commensals, pathogens, and mucosa in lung diseases of global significance.

## Triggers for the onset and recurrence of psoriasis: a review and update.
 14.02.2024, _S Liu, M He, J Jiang, X Duan, B Chai, J Zhang, Q Tao, H Chen_


_Humans, Psoriasis, Skin, Microbiota_
Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, involving a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Previous studies have demonstrated that genetic factors play a major role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. However, non-genetic factors are also necessary to trigger the onset and recurrence of psoriasis in genetically predisposed individuals, which include infections, microbiota dysbiosis of the skin and gut, dysregulated lipid metabolism, dysregulated sex hormones, and mental illness. Psoriasis can also be induced by other environmental triggers, such as skin trauma, unhealthy lifestyles, and medications. Understanding how these triggers play a role in the onset and recurrence of psoriasis provides insights into psoriasis pathogenesis, as well as better clinical administration. In this review, we summarize the triggers for the onset and recurrence of psoriasis and update the current evidence on the underlying mechanism of how these factors elicit the disease. Video Abstract.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) describes the transmission of DNA outside of direct ancestral lineages. The process is best characterised within the bacterial kingdom and can enable the acquisition of genetic traits that support bacterial adaptation to novel niches. The adaptation of bacteria to novel niches has particular relevance for faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a therapeutic procedure which aims to resolve gut-related health conditions of individuals, through transplanted gut microbiota from healthy donors.

The widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced mortality and improved life expectancy for people living with HIV (PLWH). However, even with HIV-1 suppression, chronic immune activation and elevated inflammation persist and have been linked to a pro-inflammatory gut microbiome composition and compromised intestinal barrier integrity. PLWH in urban versus rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa experience differences in environmental factors that may impact the gut microbiome and immune system, in response to ART, yet this has not previously been investigated in these groups. To address this, we measured T cell activation/exhaustion/trafficking markers, plasma inflammatory markers, and fecal microbiome composition in PLWH and healthy participants recruited from an urban clinic in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, and a district hospital that services surrounding rural villages. PLWH were either ART naïve at baseline and sampled again after 24 weeks of first-line ART and the antibiotic cotrimoxazole or were ART-experienced at both timepoints.

In this study, we investigated the characteristics of gut microbiome in the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) patients, and how they correlate with metabolic and inflammatory profiles. A total of 120 obese people without metabolic comorbidities were recruited, and their clinical phenotypes, metabolic and inflammatory parameters were analysed. The faecal microbial markers originating from bacterial cell and extracellular vesicle (EV) were profiled using 16S rDNA sequencing. The total study population could be classified into two distinct enterotypes (enterotype I: Prevotellaceae-predominant, enterotype II: Akkermansia/Bacteroides-predominant), based on their stool EV-derived microbiome profile. When comparing the metabolic and inflammatory profiles, subjects in enterotype I had higher levels of serum IL-1β [false discovery rate (FDR) q = 0.050] and had a lower level of microbial diversity than enterotype II (Wilcoxon rank-sum test p &lt; 0.01). Subjects in enterotype I had relatively higher abundance of Bacteroidetes, Prevotellaceae and Prevotella-derived EVs, and lower abundance of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Akkermansia and Bacteroides-derived EVs (FDR q &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, HMO patients can be categorised into two distinct enterotypes by the faecal EV-derived microbiome profile. The enterotyping may be associated with different metabolic and inflammatory profiles. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the long-term prognostic impact of EV-derived microbiome in the obese population.

Chickens are one of the most widely farmed animals worldwide and play a crucial role in meat and egg production. Gut microbiota is essential for chickens' health, disease, growth, and egg production. However, native chickens such as Jianghan chickens have better meat and egg production quality than centralized chickens, their intestinal microbial diversity is richer, and the potential gut microbial resources may bring health benefits to the host.

## Falcon gut microbiota is shaped by diet and enriched in Salmonella.

The gut microbiome is increasingly being appreciated as a master regulator of animal health. However, avian gut microbiome studies commonly focus on birds of economic importance and the gut microbiomes of raptors remain underexplored. Here we examine the gut microbiota of 29 captive falcons-raptors of historic importance-in the context of avian evolution by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Our results reveal that evolutionary histories and diet are significantly associated with avian gut microbiota in general, whereas diet plays a major role in shaping the falcon gut microbiota. Multiple analyses revealed that gut microbial diversity, composition, and relative abundance of key diet-discriminating bacterial genera in the falcon gut closely resemble those of carnivorous raptors rather than those of their closest phylogenetic relatives. Furthermore, the falcon microbiota is dominated by Firmicutes and contains Salmonella at appreciable levels. Salmonella presence was associated with altered functional capacity of the falcon gut microbiota as its abundance is associated with depletion of multiple predicted metabolic pathways involved in protein mass buildup, muscle maintenance, and enrichment of antimicrobial compound degradation, thus increasing the pathogenic potential of the falcon gut. Our results point to the necessity of screening for Salmonella and other human pathogens in captive birds to safeguard both the health of falcons and individuals who come in contact with these birds.

## A conserved interdomain microbial network underpins cadaver decomposition despite environmental variables.

Microbial breakdown of organic matter is one of the most important processes on Earth, yet the controls of decomposition are poorly understood. Here we track 36 terrestrial human cadavers in three locations and show that a phylogenetically distinct, interdomain microbial network assembles during decomposition despite selection effects of location, climate and season. We generated a metagenome-assembled genome library from cadaver-associated soils and integrated it with metabolomics data to identify links between taxonomy and function. This universal network of microbial decomposers is characterized by cross-feeding to metabolize labile decomposition products. The key bacterial and fungal decomposers are rare across non-decomposition environments and appear unique to the breakdown of terrestrial decaying flesh, including humans, swine, mice and cattle, with insects as likely important vectors for dispersal. The observed lockstep of microbial interactions further underlies a robust microbial forensic tool with the potential to aid predictions of the time since death.

The effect of microbes on their human host is often mediated through changes in metabolite concentrations. As such, multiple tools have been proposed to predict metabolite concentrations from microbial taxa frequencies. Such tools typically fail to capture the dependence of the microbiome-metabolite relation on the environment.

Fresh-frozen stool banks intended for humans with gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders have been recently established and there are ongoing efforts to establish the first veterinary fresh-frozen stool bank. Fresh frozen stored feces provide an advantage of increased availability and accessibility to high-quality optimal donor fecal material. The stability of frozen canine feces regarding fecal microbiome composition and diversity has not been reported in dogs, providing the basis for this study. We hypothesized that fecal microbial composition and diversity of healthy dogs would remain stable when stored at -20°C and -80°C for up to 12 months compared to baseline samples evaluated before freezing. Stool samples were collected from 20 apparently healthy dogs, manually homogenized, cryopreserved in 20% glycerol and aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C or -80°C for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. At baseline and after period of storage, aliquots were thawed and treated with propidium monoazide before fecal DNA extraction. Following long-read 16S-rRNA amplicon sequencing, bacterial community composition and diversity were compared among treatment groups. We demonstrated that fresh-frozen canine stools collected from 20 apparently healthy dogs could be stored for up to 12 months at -80°C with minimal change in microbial community composition and diversity and that storage at -80°C is superior to storage at -20°C. We also found that differences between dogs had the largest effect on community composition and diversity. Relative abundances of certain bacterial taxa, including those known to be short-chain fatty acid producers, varied significantly with specific storage temperatures and duration. Further work is required to ascertain whether fecal donor material that differs in bacterial community composition and diversity across storage conditions and duration could lead to differences in clinical efficacy for specific clinical indications of fecal microbiota transplantation.
