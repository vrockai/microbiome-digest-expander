Shotgun metagenomic sequencing is a powerful approach to study microbiomes in an unbiased manner and of increasing relevance for identifying novel enzymatic functions. However, the potential of metagenomics to relate from microbiome composition to function has thus far been underutilized. Here, we introduce the Metagenomics Genome-Phenome Association (MetaGPA) study framework, which allows linking genetic information in metagenomes with a dedicated functional phenotype. We applied MetaGPA to identify enzymes associated with cytosine modifications in environmental samples. From the 2365 genes that met our significance criteria, we confirm known pathways for cytosine modifications and proposed novel cytosine-modifying mechanisms. Specifically, we characterized and identified a novel nucleic acid modifying enzyme, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine carbamoyltransferase, that catalyzes the formation of a previously unknown cytosine modification, 5-carbamoyloxymethylcytosine, in DNA and RNA. Our work introduces MetaGPA as a novel and versatile tool for advancing functional metagenomics.

## Long-term dynamics of the human oral microbiome during clinical disease progression.
 07.11.2021, _A Duran-Pinedo, J Solbiati, F Teles, R Teles, Y Zang, J Frias-Lopez_


Oral microbiome dysbiosis is linked to overt inflammation of tooth-supporting tissues, leading to periodontitis, an oral condition that can cause tooth and bone loss. Microbiome dysbiosis has been described as a disruption in the symbiotic microbiota composition's stability that could adversely affect the host's health status. However, the precise microbiome dynamics that lead to dysbiosis and the progression of the disease are largely unknown. The objective of our study was to investigate the long-term dynamics of periodontitis progression and its connection to dysbiosis.

## Microbiome characteristics and the key biochemical reactions identified on stone world cultural heritage under different climate conditions.
 06.11.2021, _X Ding, W Lan, A Yan, Y Li, Y Katayama, JD Gu_


The surfaces of historical stone monuments are visibly covered with a layer of colonizing microorganisms and their degradation products. In this study, a metadata analysis was conducted using the microbial sequencing data available from NCBI database to determine the diversity, biodeterioration potential and functionality of the stone microbiome on important world cultural heritage sites under four different climatic conditions. The retrieved stone microbial community composition in these metagenomes shows a clear association between climate types of the historical monuments and the diversity and taxonomic composition of the stone microbiomes. Shannon diversity values showed that microbial communities on stone monuments exposed to dry climate were more diverse than those under humid ones. In particular, functions associated with photosynthesis and UV resistance were identified from geographical locations under different climate types. The distribution of key microbial determinants responsible for stone deterioration was linked to survival under extreme environmental conditions and biochemical capabilities and reactions. Among them, biochemical reactions of the microbial nitrogen and sulfur cycles were most predominant. These stone-dwelling microbiomes on historical stone monuments were highly diverse and self-sustaining driven by energy metabolism and biomass accumulation. And metabolic products of the internal geomicrobiological nitrogen cycling on these ancient monuments play a unique role in the biodeterioration of stone monuments. These results highlight the significance of identifying the essential microbial biochemical reactions to advance the understanding of stone biodeterioration for protection management.

## Fecal biomarkers of environmental enteric dysfunction and the gut microbiota of rural Malawian children: An observational study.
 08.11.2021, _D Chaima, H Pickering, JD Hart, SE Burr, KM Maleta, K Kalua, RL Bailey, MJ Holland_


Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a subclinical condition of the gut characterized by changes in morphology and function with underlying chronic inflammatory responses. This study characterized composition and diversity of the gut microbiota in rural Malawian children with and without signs of EED. Fecal samples were collected from children aged 1-59 months. Neopterin, myeloperoxidase and alpha-1 antitrypsin concentrations were quantified by ELISA and combined to form a composite EED score using principal component analysis. DNA was extracted from fecal samples and V4-16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the gut microbiota. The concentrations of all three biomarkers decreased with increasing age, which is consistent with other studies of children living in similar low-income settings. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla while Faecalibacterium and Bifidobacterium were the most prevalent genera. Increased alpha diversity was associated with a reduction in neopterin concentration. Microbiota composition was different between fecal samples with low and high composite EED scores; increased abundance of Succinivibrio was associated with reduced composite EED scores.

## The Evolving Role of Consensus Molecular Subtypes: a Step Beyond Inpatient Selection for Treatment of Colorectal Cancer.
 08.11.2021, _J Ros, I Baraibar, G Martini, F Salvà, N Saoudi, JL Cuadra-Urteaga, R Dienstmann, J Tabernero, E Élez_


The heterogenous nature of colorectal cancer (CRC) renders it a major clinical challenge. Increasing genomic understanding of CRC has improved our knowledge of this heterogeneity and the main cancer drivers, with significant improvements in clinical outcomes. Comprehensive molecular characterization has allowed clinicians a more precise range of treatment options based on biomarker selection. Furthermore, this deep molecular understanding likely extends therapeutic options to a larger number of patients. The biological associations of consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) with clinical outcomes in localized CRC have been validated in retrospective clinical trials. The prognostic role of CMS has also been confirmed in the metastatic setting, with CMS2 having the best prognosis, whereas CMS1 tumors are associated with a higher risk of progression and death after chemotherapy. Similarly, according to mesenchymal features and immunosuppressive molecules, CMS1 responds to immunotherapy, whereas CMS4 has a poorer prognosis, suggesting that a CMS1 signature could identify patients who may benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors regardless of microsatellite instability (MSI) status. The main goal of these comprehensive analyses is to switch from "one marker-one drug" to "multi-marker drug combinations" allowing oncologists to give "the right drug to the right patient." Despite the revealing data from transcriptomic analyses, the high rate of intra-tumoral heterogeneity across the different CMS subgroups limits its incorporation as a predictive biomarker. In clinical practice, when feasible, comprehensive genomic tests should be performed to identify potentially targetable alterations, particularly in RAS/BRAF wild-type, MSI, and right-sided tumors. Furthermore, CMS has not only been associated with clinical outcomes and specific tumor and patient phenotypes but also with specific microbiome patterns. Future steps will include the integration of clinical features, genomics, transcriptomics, and microbiota to select the most accurate biomarkers to identify optimal treatments, improving individual clinical outcomes. In summary, CMS is context specific, identifies a level of heterogeneity beyond standard genomic biomarkers, and offers a means of maximizing personalized therapy.

## The role of the host microbiome in autism and neurodegenerative disorders and effect of epigenetic procedures in the brain functions.
 07.11.2021, _B Yousefi, P Kokhaei, F Mehranfar, A Bahar, A Abdolshahi, A Emadi, M Eslami_


Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurological/neurodegenerative syndrome that results in cognitive and communication disorders. The degree of dysbiosis is related to the severity of ASD signs. The gut is conferred with a variety of sensory receptors that cooperate with effector systems including the endocrine, nervous and gut immune systems of the intestine. Gut dysbiosis causes amplified inflammation, the launch of the HPA axis, changed levels of neurotransmitters and bacterial metabolites; these may donate to abnormal signaling throughout the Vagus nerve in ASD. Decreased integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier led to extreme leakage of substances as of the intestine in early life and inflammation followed by disruption of BBB integrity maybe increase the risk of ASD. Microbiota, by controlling the barrier permeability, regulate the quantity and types of bioactive materials that are transferred from the intestine to the brain. Exposure to metabolites and microbial products regulate significant procedures in the CNS, including glial cell role, myelination, synaptic pruning, and play a role in neurobehavioral, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and metabolic syndrome.

## The Oral Microbiota and its Role in Carcinogenesis.
 07.11.2021, _M Stasiewicz, TM Karpiński_


Despite decades of research, cancer continues to be a major global health concern. In recent years, the role played by microorganisms in the development and progression of cancer has come under increased scrutiny. The aim of the present review is to highlight the main associations between members of the human oral microbiota and various cancers. The PubMed database was searched for available literature to outline the current state of understanding regarding the role of the oral microbiota and a variety of human cancers. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is associated with carriage of a number of oral bacteria (e.g., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sp.), certain viruses (e.g., human papilloma virus, human herpes virus 8, herpes simplex virus 1 and Epstein-Barr virus) and yeast Candida albicans. Moreover, members of the oral microbiota are associated with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon/rectum and lung. Furthermore, the present review outlines a number of the carcinogenic mechanisms underlying the presented microbial associations with cancer. Such information may one day help clinicians to diagnose neoplastic diseases at earlier stages and prescribe treatments that take into account the possible microbial nature of carcinogenesis.

## Gut microbiota: sculptors of the intestinal stem cell niche in health and inflammatory bowel disease.
 08.11.2021, _M Markandey, A Bajaj, NE Ilott, S Kedia, S Travis, F Powrie, V Ahuja_


Intestinal epithelium represents a dynamic and diverse cellular system that continuously interacts with gut commensals and external cues. Intestinal stem cells, which lie at the heart of epithelial renewal and turnover, proliferate to maintain a steady stem cell population and differentiate to form functional epithelial cell types. This rather sophisticated assembly-line is maintained by an elaborate micro-environment, sculpted by a myriad of host and gut microbiota-derived signals, forming an intestinal stem cell niche. This complex, yet crucial signaling niche undergoes dynamic changes during homeostasis and chronic intestinal inflammation. Inflammatory bowel disease refers to a chronic inflammatory response toward pathogenic or commensal microbiota, in a genetically susceptible host. Compositional and functional alterations in gut microbiota are pathognomonic of IBD.The present review highlights the modulatory role of gut microbiota on the intestinal stem cell niche during homeostasis and inflammatory bowel disease. We discuss the mechanisms of direct action of gut commensals (through microbiota-derived or microbiota-influenced metabolites) on ISCs, followed by their effects via other epithelial and immune cell types.

## The gastrointestinal microbiota in colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion.
 08.11.2021, _C Henstra, J van Praagh, P Olinga, A Nagelkerke_


Colorectal carcinoma is the third most common cancer in developed countries and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Interest in the influence of the intestinal microbiota on CRC emerged rapidly in the past few years, and the close presence of microbiota to the tumour mass creates a unique microenvironment in CRC. The gastrointestinal microbiota secrete factors that can contribute to CRC metastasis by influencing, for example, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Although the role of EMT in metastasis is well-studied, mechanisms by which gastrointestinal microbiota contribute to the progression of CRC remain poorly understood. In this review, we will explore bacterial factors that contribute to the migration and invasion of colorectal carcinoma and the mechanisms involved. Bacteria involved in the induction of metastasis in primary CRC include Fusobacterium nucleatum, Enterococcus faecalis, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Examples of prominent bacterial factors secreted by these bacteria include Fusobacterium adhesin A and Bacteroides fragilis Toxin. Most of these factors induce EMT-like properties in carcinoma cells and, as such, contribute to disease progression by affecting cell-cell adhesion, breakdown of the extracellular matrix and reorganisation of the cytoskeleton. It is of utmost importance to elucidate how bacterial factors promote CRC recurrence and metastasis to increase patient survival. So far, mainly animal models have been used to demonstrate this interplay between the host and microbiota. More human-based models are needed to study the mechanisms that promote migration and invasion and mimic the progression and recurrence of CRC.

The human intestine hosts a vast and complex microbial community that is vital for maintaining several functions related with host health. The processes that determine the gut microbiome composition are poorly understood, being the interaction between species, the external environment, and the relationship with the host the most feasible. Animal models offer the opportunity to understand the interactions between the host and the microbiota. There are different gnotobiotic mice or rat models colonized with the human microbiota, however, to our knowledge, there are no reports on the colonization of germ-free zebrafish with a complex human intestinal microbiota. In the present study, we have successfully colonized 5 days postfertilization germ-free zebrafish larvae with the human intestinal microbiota previously extracted from a donor and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing the composition of the transferred microbial communities that established inside the zebrafish gut. Thus, we describe for first time which human bacteria phylotypes are able to colonize the zebrafish digestive tract. Species with relevant interest because of their linkage to dysbiosis in different human diseases, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Prevotella spp., or Roseburia spp. have been successfully transferred inside the zebrafish digestive tract.

## Effects of anti-aging interventions on intestinal microbiota.
 08.11.2021, _Y Du, Y Gao, B Zeng, X Fan, D Yang, M Yang_


Identifying ways to deal with the challenges presented by aging is an urgent task, as we are facing an aging society. External factors such as diet, exercise and drug therapy have proven to be major elements in controlling healthy aging and prolonging life expectancy. More recently, the intestinal microbiota has also become a key factor in the anti-aging process. As the intestinal microbiota changes with aging, an imbalance in intestinal microorganisms can lead to many age-related degenerative diseases and unhealthy aging. This paper reviews recent research progress on the relationship between intestinal microorganisms and anti-aging effects, focusing on the changes and beneficial effects of intestinal microorganisms under dietary intervention, exercise and drug intervention. In addition, bacteriotherapy has been used to prevent frailty and unhealthy aging. Most of these anti-aging approaches improve the aging process and age-related diseases by regulating the homeostasis of intestinal flora and promoting a healthy intestinal environment. Intervention practices based on intestinal microorganisms show great potential in the field of anti-aging medicine.

## Comparative Study of the Gut Microbiota Among Four Different Marine Mammals in an Aquarium.
 08.11.2021, _S Bai, P Zhang, C Zhang, J Du, X Du, C Zhu, J Liu, P Xie, S Li_


Despite an increasing appreciation in the importance of host-microbe interactions in ecological and evolutionary processes, information on the gut microbial communities of some marine mammals is still lacking. Moreover, whether diet, environment, or host phylogeny has the greatest impact on microbial community structure is still unknown. To fill part of this knowledge gap, we exploited a natural experiment provided by an aquarium with belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) affiliated with family Monodontidae, Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) and common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) affiliated with family Delphinidae, and Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) affiliated with family Otariidae. Results show significant differences in microbial community composition of whales, dolphins, and fur seals and indicate that host phylogeny (family level) plays the most important role in shaping the microbial communities, rather than food and environment. In general, the gut microbial communities of dolphins had significantly lower diversity compared to that of whales and fur seals. Overall, the gut microbial communities were mainly composed of Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria, together with some from Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Epsilonbacteraeota. However, specific bacterial lineages were differentially distributed among the marine mammal groups. For instance, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae were the dominant bacterial lineages in the gut of belugas, while for Cape fur seals, Moraxellaceae and Bacteroidaceae were the main bacterial lineages. Moreover, gut microbial communities in both Pacific white-sided dolphins and common bottlenose dolphins were dominated by a number of pathogenic bacteria, including Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio fluvialis, and Morganella morganii, reflecting the poor health condition of these animals. Although there is a growing recognition of the role microorganisms play in the gut of marine mammals, current knowledge about these microbial communities is still severely lacking. Large-scale research studies should be undertaken to reveal the roles played by the gut microbiota of different marine mammal species.

## Progress and prospects of the healthy human gut virome.
 06.11.2021, _SR Stockdale, C Hill_


Not all viruses associated with humans cause disease. Non-pathogenic human-infecting viruses are predicted as important for immune system induction and preparation. Phages that infect bacteria are the most abundant predators of the human microbial ecosystem, promoting and maintaining bacterial diversity. Metagenomic analyses of the human gut virome and microbiome are unravelling the intricate predator-prey dynamics of phage-bacteria co-existence, co-evolution, and their interplay with the human host. While most adults harbour a distinctly individualistic and persistent community of virulent phages, new-borns are dominated by temperate phages heavily influenced by environmental exposures. The future development of microbiome-based interventions, therapeutics, and manipulation, will require a greater understanding of the human microbiome and the virome.

## Integrating the human microbiome in the forensic toolkit: Current bottlenecks and future solutions.
 06.11.2021, _C Díez López, A Vidaki, M Kayser_


Over the last few years, advances in massively parallel sequencing technologies (also referred to next generation sequencing) and bioinformatics analysis tools have boosted our knowledge on the human microbiome. Such insights have brought new perspectives and possibilities to apply human microbiome analysis in many areas, particularly in medicine. In the forensic field, the use of microbial DNA obtained from human materials is still in its infancy but has been suggested as a potential alternative in situations when other human (non-microbial) approaches present limitations. More specifically, DNA analysis of a wide variety of microorganisms that live in and on the human body offers promises to answer various forensically relevant questions, such as post-mortem interval estimation, individual identification, and tissue/body fluid identification, among others. However, human microbiome analysis currently faces significant challenges that need to be considered and overcome via future forensically oriented human microbiome research to provide the necessary solutions. In this perspective article, we discuss the most relevant biological, technical and data-related issues and propose future solutions that will pave the way towards the integration of human microbiome analysis in the forensic toolkit.
