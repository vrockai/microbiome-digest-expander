## Causal discovery for the microbiome.
 24.09.2022, _J Corander, WP Hanage, J Pensar_


Measurement and manipulation of the microbiome is generally considered to have great potential for understanding the causes of complex diseases in humans, developing new therapies, and finding preventive measures. Many studies have found significant associations between the microbiome and various diseases; however, Koch's classical postulates remind us about the importance of causative reasoning when considering the relationship between microbes and a disease manifestation. Although causal discovery in observational microbiome data faces many challenges, methodological advances in causal structure learning have improved the potential of data-driven prediction of causal effects in large-scale biological systems. In this Personal View, we show the capability of existing methods for inferring causal effects from metagenomic data, and we highlight ways in which the introduction of causal structures that are more flexible than existing structures offers new opportunities for causal reasoning. Our observations suggest that microbiome research can further benefit from tools developed in the past 5 years in causal discovery and learn from their applications elsewhere.

Microorganisms within the gut and other niches may contribute to carcinogenesis, as well as shaping cancer immunosurveillance and response to immunotherapy. Our understanding of the complex relationship between different host-intrinsic microorganisms, as well as the multifaceted mechanisms by which they influence health and disease, has grown tremendously-hastening development of novel therapeutic strategies that target the microbiota to improve treatment outcomes in cancer. Accordingly, the evaluation of a patient's microbial composition and function and its subsequent targeted modulation represent key elements of future multidisciplinary and precision-medicine approaches. In this Review, we outline the current state of research toward harnessing the microbiome to better prevent and treat cancer.

## Gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis-related cognitive impairment.
 27.09.2022, _F Ghadiri, Z Ebadi, E Asadollahzadeh, A Naser Moghadasi_


Cognition is one of the most evaluated neurologic subjects with which the gut microbiome is supposed to be associated. Cognitive impairment is a prevalent finding in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we are about to study the current evidence on the effect of gut microbiota on cognition and MS. Although no direct evidence is in hand, putting all indirect research together, one could think of the hypothetical benefit of brain-gut axis interventions (possibly diet changes, probiotic administration, microbiota transplant) to solve the drastic problem of cognitive impairment in MS. Hence, researchers are encouraged to scan this horizon in order to fill the knowledge gaps in the field.

## Gut microbial fermentation promotes the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of Chinese yam polysaccharides.
 27.09.2022, _Y Bai, Y Zhou, R Zhang, Y Chen, F Wang, M Zhang_


Plant polysaccharides possess many health-promoting properties, which are closely related to the digestion, absorption and utilization of polysaccharides in the host. The characteristic changes in Chinese yam polysaccharide (CYP) during simulated gastrointestinal digestion and faecal fermentation, as well as the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of CYP and fermented CYP, were studied. The molecular weight of CYP remained unchanged during gastrointestinal digestion. After 24 h of faecal fermentation, free glucose and mannose released from CYP were utilized by gut microbiota, and the production of short-chain fatty acids increased. Simultaneously, CYP improved the growth of Bifidobacterium and Megasphaera. Compared with CYP, faecal fermented CYP exhibited greater suppression of anti-inflammatory mediators and increased intestinal tight junction expression in LPS-stimulated coculture Caco-2/Raw264.7 cells. The obtained results reveal that the role of CYP in promoting gut health is closely related to the interactions between CYP and gut microbes, and CYP has potential as an anti-inflammatory adjuvant in enteritis therapy.

## Characterizing the chicken gut colonization ability of a diverse group of bacteria.

The development of probiotics for chickens is a rapidly expanding field. The main approach to probiotics is to administer the probiotic strain throughout the bird's life, usually through incorporation in the feed. However, probiotics which would utilize bacterial strains capable of permanently colonizing the gut after a single exposure are likely to have a greater impact on the developing gut community as well as on the host, would simplify probiotic use and also reduce costs in an industrial setting. Finally, very limited and conflicting information about the colonization ability of different bacterial strains has been reported. Here we report 2 colonization experiments using 14 different bacterial strains from diverse phylogenetic groups. In both experiments, groups of chicks were orally inoculated on the day of hatch with different bacterial strains that had been previously isolated from adult heavy breeders. In the first experiment, colonization of the bacterial strains in broiler chicks was determined 7 d after treatment. In the second experiment, colonization was followed in layer chicks until d 17. Ten of the bacterial strains, including Lactobacillales and Bacteroidales strains, were able to colonize chicks after a single exposure for the duration of the experiment. For a few of these strains, exposure had little effect compared to non-treated chicks due to natural background colonization. Only 4 strains failed to colonize the chicks. Moreover, it is shown that fecal samples are useful to identify and provide a dynamic view of colonization. We further analyzed the effects of artificial colonization on microbiota composition. Some of the strains used in this research were found to reduce Enterobacteriaceae family abundance, implying that they might be useful in reducing relevant pathogen levels. To conclude, our results show that the development of single exposure based probiotics is possible.

## Impact of aluminum exposure on oxidative stress, intestinal changes and immune responses in red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).
 24.09.2022, _X Zhang, M Shen, C Wang, M Gao, L Wang, Z Jin, X Xia_


Aluminum (Al) is an abundant metal that has been classified as a threatening pollutant due to indiscriminate use and anthropogenic activities. This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of Al on crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), including biochemical change, histological alteration, gut microbial community diversification, and immune changes. The bioaccumulation of Al was detected in the hemolymph and intestine of crayfish after Al exposure at different time points. Results showed that Al exposure significantly induced oxidative stress and caused pathohistological changes on intestinal barrier structures in crayfish. It was found that the intestinal microbiota was affected by retained Al and the intestinal community diversity was changed after Al treated in the crayfish. Furthermore, Al exposure affected the immunity in crayfish, by altering the expression of a set of immune-related genes, as well as reducing the phenoloxidase and lysozyme activities. Moreover, Al exposure promoted hemocytes apoptosis and impaired hemophagocytic capacity against Vibro parahamolyticus, resulting in higher mortality of crayfish upon bacterial infection. Taken these results together, we conclude that excessive Al exposure caused adverse effects on multiple biological processes of crayfish and Al pollution is a potential threat to crayfish culture.

## Natural diversity uncovers P5CS1 regulation and its role in drought stress tolerance and yield sustainability in barley.
 21.09.2022, _A Shrestha, A Fendel, TH Nguyen, A Adebabay, AS Kullik, J Benndorf, J Leon, AA Naz_


Proline accumulation is one of the major responses of plants to many abiotic stresses. However, the significance of proline accumulation for drought stress tolerance remains enigmatic in crop plants. First, we examined the natural variation of the pyrolline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS1) among 49 barley genotypes. Allele mining identified a previously unknown allelic series that showed polymorphisms at 42 cis-elements across the P5CS1 promoter. Selected haplotypes had quantitative variation in P5CS1 gene expression and proline accumulation, putatively influenced by both ABA-dependent and independent pathways under drought stress. Next, we introgressed the P5CS1 allele from a high proline accumulating wild barley accession ISR42-8 into cultivar Scarlett developing a near-isogenic line (NIL-143). NIL-143 accumulated higher proline concentrations than Scarlett under drought stress at seedling and reproductive stages. Under drought stress, NIL-143 showed less pigment damage, sustained photosynthetic health, and higher drought stress recovery compared to Scarlett. Further, the drought-induced damage to yield-related traits, mainly thousand-grain weight, was lower in NIL-143 compared to Scarlett in field conditions. Our data uncovered new variants of the P5CS1 promoter and the significance of the increased proline accumulation regulated by the P5CS1 allele of ISR42-8 in drought stress tolerance and yield stability in barley.

## Microbial Composition of Freshwater Marsh Sediment Responds more Strongly to Microcosm Seawater Addition than Simulated Nitrate or Phosphate Eutrophication.
 24.09.2022, _EA Weingarten, CR Jackson_


As sea level rise impacts coastal wetlands, saltmarsh will overtake coastal freshwater marsh in many areas, but changes in the sediment microbiome in response to saltwater intrusion are difficult to predict. Coastal freshwater marsh sediment was exposed to ambient, brackish, and saline conditions as well as to elevated nitrate and phosphate to model the combined stresses of saltwater intrusion and coastal eutrophication. Initially, sediment prokaryotic composition was similar to prior studies of freshwater marsh but diverged over time, reflecting the magnitude of increase in saltwater. There was no observed effect of nutrient amendment, potentially ranking seawater intrusion as a higher-importance compositional driver. Although the previously described loss of methanogenic populations and promotion of sulfate reducers in response to saltwater exposure was observed, taxonomic distribution was not similar to typical meso-polyhaline wetlands. Without colonization by marine taxa, such a community may be short-lived naturally, ultimately equilibrating with more common saltmarsh species. However, the recapitulation of salinity concentration by freshwater sediment microbial composition demonstrates the overwhelming nature of saltwater intrusion relative to other drivers like eutrophication.

Controlling excess biomass accumulation and clogging is important for maintaining the performance of gas biofilters and reducing energy consumption. Interruption of bacterial communication (quorum quenching) can modulate gene expression and alter biofilm properties. However, whether the problem of excess biomass accumulation in gas biofilters can be addressed by interrupting bacterial communication remains unknown.
