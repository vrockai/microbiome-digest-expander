Adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic autoinflammatory disease, characterised by fever, arthritis, and skin rash, and joint involvement is one of its clinical manifestations. The aims of this work were to assess joint involvement, to describe main patterns of involvement, and associated clinical characteristics. In this work, we aimed at assessing the joint involvement in AOSD by using MRI, to describe main patterns and associated clinical characteristics. In addition, we aimed at assessing the global transcriptomic profile of synovial tissues in AOSD to elucidate possible pathogenic pathways involved. We also evaluated the global transcriptomic profile of synovial tissues to elucidate possible pathogenic pathways involved in the disease. Thus, AOSD patients, who underwent to MRI exam on joints, were assessed to describe patterns of joint involvement and associated clinical characteristics. Some synovial tissues were collected for RNA-sequencing purposes. The most common MRI finding was the presence of synovitis on 60.5%, mainly in peripheral affected joints, with low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-fat-saturated weighted and STIR images. Bone oedema and MRI-bone erosions were reported on 34.9% and 25.6% MRI exams, respectively. Patients with MRI-bone erosions showed a higher prevalence of splenomegaly, a more frequent chronic disease course, lower levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and ferritin. In AOSD synovial tissues, a hyper-expression of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and TNF pathways was shown together with ferritin genes. In conclusion, in AOSD patients, the most common MRI-finding was the presence of synovitis, characterised by intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-fat-saturated weighted and STIR images. MRI-bone erosions and bone oedema were also observed. In AOSD synovial tissues, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF pathways together with ferritin genes resulted to be hyper-expressed.

## Updated Treatment for Acne: Targeted Therapy Based on Pathogenesis.
 11.06.2021, _I Kurokawa, AM Layton, R Ogawa_


Previous approaches to acne management have focused on the four main factors implicated in acne, namely, androgen-mediated sebogenesis (considered integral to acne), hyperkeratinization, colonization with Cutibacterium acnes, and inflammation related to both innate and adaptive mechanisms. Recent advances have facilitated potential novel approaches to acne management, as the pathophysiology and the immunological aspects related to acne and wound healing have evolved. Particular targets that have been shown to be closely involved in acne pathophysiology and wound healing include interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Biological antibodies targeting IL-1β, IL-17, IL-23, and TNFα could provide novel approaches for treating severe acne and related disorders. Acne is primarily a disease associated with sebogenesis. Monosaturated free acids are important components. Insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) promotes the proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes and IL-1β. Research into the microbiome may also provide insights into potential future therapeutic options for acne. Scars, both atrophic and hypertrophic, are common sequelae to acne. Risk factors associated with the development of acne scars include genetic, systemic, local, and lifestyle factors. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have been shown to play a crucial role in the development of acne-induced hypertrophic scars. Treatment for extensive inflammatory keloid scarring is limited. Surgery and postoperative radiotherapy are two possible options. Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), IGF-1, and B cells are found in keloid or hypertrophic scar tissues. Biological antibodies targeting these cytokines may be a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of this type of scar in the future. Future treatment for acne should embrace approaches that target the main etiological factors of acne. In particular, specific emphasis on aggressive treatment in the acute inflammatory phase to reduce the likelihood of scarring and other clinical sequelae, such as pigmentary changes would be highly desirable. Treatment for established acne-induced sequelae should also be considered.

Recent studies reporting the intricate crosstalk between cellular and molecular mediators and the lymphatic endothelium in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) suggest altered inflammatory cell drainage and lymphatic vasculature, implicating the lymphatic system as a player in the occurrence, development, and recurrence of intestinal diseases. This article aims to review recent data on the modulatory functions of cellular and molecular components of the IBD microenvironment on the lymphatic system, particularly lymphangiogenesis. It serves as a promising therapeutic target for IBD management and treatment. The interaction with gut microbiota is also explored.

Preeclampsia is a dangerous pregnancy complication. The source of preeclampsia is unknown, though the placenta is believed to have a central role in its pathogenesis. An association between maternal infection and preeclampsia has been demonstrated, yet the involvement of the placental microbiome in the etiology of preeclampsia has not been determined. In this study, we examined whether preeclampsia is associated with an imbalanced microorganism composition in the placenta.

## Supplier-origin mouse microbiomes significantly influence locomotor and anxiety-related behavior, body morphology, and metabolism.
 11.06.2021, _AC Ericsson, ML Hart, J Kwan, L Lanoue, LR Bower, R Araiza, KC Kent Lloyd, CL Franklin_


The mouse is the most commonly used model species in biomedical research. Just as human physical and mental health are influenced by the commensal gut bacteria, mouse models of disease are influenced by the fecal microbiome (FM). The source of mice represents one of the strongest influences on the FM and can influence the phenotype of disease models. The FM influences behavior in mice leading to the hypothesis that mice of the same genetic background from different vendors, will have different behavioral phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, colonies of CD-1 mice, rederived via embryo transfer into surrogate dams from four different suppliers, were subjected to phenotyping assays assessing behavior and physiological parameters. Significant differences in behavior, growth rate, metabolism, and hematological parameters were observed. Collectively, these findings show the profound influence of supplier-origin FMs on host behavior and physiology in healthy, genetically similar, wild-type mice maintained in identical environments.

## Microbial interaction: Prevotella spp. reduce P. aeruginosa induced inflammation in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells.
 11.06.2021, _A Bertelsen, JS Elborn, BC Schock_


In Cystic Fibrosis (CF) airways, the dehydrated, thick mucus promotes the establishment of persistent polymicrobial infections and drives chronic airways inflammation. This also predisposes the airways to further infections, the vicious, self-perpetuating cycle causing lung damage and progressive lung function decline. The airways are a poly-microbial environment, containing both aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infections contribute to the excessive inflammatory response in CF, but the role of anaerobic Prevotella spp., frequently found in CF airways, is not known.

## Extra-skeletal effects of dietary calcium: Impact on the cardiovascular system, obesity, and cancer.
 11.06.2021, _DK Daley, SB Myrie_


Calcium is well known to be integral to bone and muscle health, with deleterious effects such as osteoporosis associated with inadequate calcium intake. Recent studies have also highlighted the significant effects of calcium in extra-musculoskeletal functioning, including the cardiovascular system, obesity, and cancer. Calcium impacts the cardiovascular system as an antagonist associated with a reduction in hypertension, increase vasodilation, and improvement in blood vessel function when obtained in the diet as an organic source, through food. However, the inorganic source of calcium, found in supplements, may be negatively associated with the cardiovascular system due to plaque deposits and atherogenesis when taken in excess. Some studies suggest that calcium intake may impact obesity by regulation of adipogenesis and reducing fat deposits with resulting weight loss. The pathogenesis of calcium for reducing obesity is thought to be related in part to its impact on gut microbiota profile, with the suggestion that calcium may have prebiotic properties. Animal and some human studies propose that calcium may also have a role in cancer prevention and/or treatment due to its function in the cell proliferation process and the impact on hormonal regulation, and thus warrants more investigations in the human population. Some prospective and small clinical studies suggest that calcium may be beneficial for colorectal cancer. Overall, emerging research in various areas continues to highlight the essentiality of dietary calcium for functioning at the molecular and biochemical level toward improvement in health and some chronic disease conditions.

## Exploring the microbiota-Alzheimer's Disease linkage using short-term antibiotic treatment followed by fecal microbiota transplantation.
 10.06.2021, _M Wang, J Cao, C Gong, W Kwame Amakye, M Yao, J Ren_


Gut microbiota is proven to be involved in the development of beta amyloid (Aβ) pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since there are difficulties in translating microbiota findings based on germ-free mice into clinical practice, here, we used short-term antibiotic cocktail treatment to develop a novel model with a near-germ-free status and without impacting Aβ pathology. Three months old APPSWE/PS1ΔE9 mice were fed with antibiotic cocktails for two weeks by gavage to obtain a near "germ-free" status, and then received the donor fecal matter from the 16 months old APP/PS1 mice for 7 consecutive days. Fecal pellets were collected prior to antibiotics treatment, following antibiotic exposure, prior to and following fecal microbiota transplantation for gut microbiota analysis. Also, Aβ pathology, astrocyte and microglia morphology were further explored. Pre-antibiotic-treated mice successfully allowed engraftment of gut microbiota following 7 consecutive days gavage with aged APP/PS1 mice microbiota. Microbiota reconstitution by transplantation was largely attributable to the donor source (e.g. g_Coriobacteriaceae and g_Clostridium) and led to a significant increase in Aβ plaques. Surprisingly, astrocyte activation around Aβ plaques was suppressed rather than microglia, the well-recognized plaque phagocytic cell type in Aβ clearance, following microbiota engraftment. Our findings provide a novel framework for understanding the mechanisms of AD through the gut-brain axis and the translation of gut microbiota manipulation from bench to clinical practice.

## Dispersal strategies shape persistence and evolution of human gut bacteria.
 10.06.2021, _F Hildebrand, TI Gossmann, C Frioux, E Özkurt, PN Myers, P Ferretti, M Kuhn, M Bahram, HB Nielsen, P Bork_


Human gut bacterial strains can co-exist with their hosts for decades, but little is known about how these microbes persist and disperse, and evolve thereby. Here, we examined these processes in 5,278 adult and infant fecal metagenomes, longitudinally sampled in individuals and families. Our analyses revealed that a subset of gut species is extremely persistent in individuals, families, and geographic regions, represented often by locally successful strains of the phylum Bacteroidota. These "tenacious" bacteria show high levels of genetic adaptation to the human host but a high probability of loss upon antibiotic interventions. By contrast, heredipersistent bacteria, notably Firmicutes, often rely on dispersal strategies with weak phylogeographic patterns but strong family transmissions, likely related to sporulation. These analyses describe how different dispersal strategies can lead to the long-term persistence of human gut microbes with implications for gut flora modulations.

## Gut Health Function of Instant Dehydrated Rice Sticks Substituted with Resistant Starch Types 2 and 4.
 11.06.2021, _N Alfilasari, P Sirivongpaisal, S Wichienchot_


The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of instant dehydrated rice sticks (IDRS) which were substituted with resistant starch (RS) types 2 and 4 whose gut health function targets gut microbiota. IDRS are a type of rice noodles that were developed by two formulations. The first formulation had substitution of rice flour with 20% RS type 2 and 0.15% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (RSc-2), and the second formulation had 25% RS type 4 and 0.15% CMC (RSc-4). RSc-2 and RSc-4 were investigated for gut health function by human fecal fermentation in a pH-controlled batch culture. The results of gut microbiota enumeration by fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmed that significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher numbers of bifidobacteria were obtained with RSc-2 (10.06 ± 0.09 log cells/mL) and RSc-4 (10.00 ± 0.06 log cells/mL) compared to the control (100% rice flour formula) at 24 h fermentation. Additionally, the prebiotic indexes of RSc-2 and RSc-4 were 3.8 and 2.8 -fold higher than that of the control at 24 h fermentation. The short-chained fatty acids, acetic, propionic and butyric acid were analyzed by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector. The butyric acids were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher with RSc-2 (43.56 ± 0.01 mM) and RSc-4 (43.63 ± 0.07 mM) compared to the control at 24 h. Thus, RSc-2 and RSc-4 showed butyrogenic, bifidogenic and prebiotic potential to support gut health and could aid in prevention of colon cancer.

## Microalgae as feed ingredients: recent developments on their role in immunomodulation and gut microbiota of aquaculture species.
 11.06.2021, _US Sagaram, MS Gaikwad, R Nandru, S Dasgupta_


Microalgae are rapidly evolving alternative ingredients in food and feed. Desirable nutritional and functional qualities make them high potential sources of feed ingredients. Certain microalgae species are known to accumulate large amounts of protein, containing all essential amino acids while some species contain essential fatty acids and bioactive compounds hence offering several possible health benefits. However, successful inclusion of microalgae-based products in feed requires a clear understanding of physiological responses and microbiota of animals receiving microalgae diets. In this review, key microalgae-based feed ingredients and their effect on gut microbiome and immunomodulatory responses of microalgae fed animals, with a focus on aquatic species will be discussed.

## Lactobacillus paracasei modulates the gut microbiota and improves inflammation in type 2 diabetic rats.
 11.06.2021, _Z Zeng, X Guo, J Zhang, Q Yuan, S Chen_


This study aimed to investigate the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei NL41 on inflammation and the gut microbiota of type 2 diabetic (T2D) rats induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ). A T2D rat model was established by inducing Sprague-Dawley rats with HFD/STZ, followed by 12-weeks L. paracasei NL41 gavage. The blood, colonic tissues, and feces samples of these rats were collected for inflammation, histology, and intestinal microbiota profiling. L. paracasei NL41 treatment induced remarkable improvement in the inflammatory status by decreasing the levels of serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS), free fatty acids (FFA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 and increasing the level of IL-10. Gut barrier function was significantly protected in NL41-treated rats. Moreover, the strain NL41 induced changes in the microbiota structure and influenced the relative abundance of the key species. Specifically, Bacteroides, Clostridia (specifically, Ruminococcus torques), and Parasutterella were significantly reduced, while some beneficial microorganisms (Bacteroidales_S24-7_group and the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae) were enriched by NL41. The correlational analyses indicated that L. paracasei NL41 ameliorating inflammation was closely related to the key species of the gut microbiota. The present study indicates that probiotic L. paracasei NL41 decreases LPS-induced inflammation by improving the gut microbiota and preserving intestinal integrity.

## Lactobacillus strains derived from human gut ameliorate metabolic disorders via modulation of gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acids metabolism.
 14.06.2021, _G Wang, G Zhu, C Chen, Y Zheng, F Ma, J Zhao, YK Lee, H Zhang, W Chen_


Regulation on gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are believed to be a pathway to suppress the development of metabolic syndrome. In this study, three Lactobacillus strains derived from the human gut were investigated for their effects on alleviation of metabolic disorders. These strains were individually administered to metabolic disorder rats induced by high-fat-high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. Each strain exhibited its own characteristics in attenuating the impaired glucose-insulin homeostasis, hepatic oxidative damage and steatosis. Correlation analysis between SCFAs and host metabolic parameters suggested that Lactobacillus protective effects on metabolic disorders are partly mediated by recovery of SCFAs production, especially the faecal acetic acid. Correspondingly, it indicated that probiotics restore the gut microbiota dysbiosis in different extent, thereby protect against metabolic disorders in a manner that is associated with microbiota, but not totally reverse the changed composition of microbiota to the normal state. Thus, Lactobacillus strains partly protect against diet-induced metabolic syndrome by microbiota modulation and acetate elevation.

## The Specification and Function of Enteroendocrine Cells in Drosophila and Mammals: A Comparative Review.
 11.06.2021, _X Guo, J Lv, R Xi_


Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) in both invertebrates and vertebrates derive from intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and are scattered along the digestive tract, where they function in sensing various environmental stimuli and subsequently secrete neurotransmitters or neuropeptides to regulate diverse biological and physiological processes. To fulfill these functions, EECs are specified into multiple subtypes that occupy specific gut regions. With advances in single-cell technology, organoid culture experimental systems, and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genomic editing, rapid progress has been made towards characterization of EEC subtypes in mammals. Additionally, studies of genetic model organisms-especially Drosophila melanogaster-have also provided insights about the molecular processes underlying EEC specification from ISCs and about the establishment of diverse EEC subtypes. In this review we compare the regulation of EEC specification and function in mammals and Drosophila, with a focus on EEC subtype characterization, on how internal and external regulators mediate EEC subtype specification, and on how EEC-mediated intra- and inter-organ communications affect gastrointestinal physiology and pathology.

## The effect of lipid metabolism regulator anthocyanins from Aronia melanocarpa on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and C57BL/6 mice via activating AMPK signaling and gut microbiota.
 11.06.2021, _C Chen, X Yang, S Liu, M Zhang, C Wang, X Xia, Y Lou, H Xu_


This study investigated lipid metabolism regulation by anthocyanins from Aronia melanocarpa (AAM) in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and high fat diet (HFD) mice. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis identified the constituents of AAM, which decreased lipid content and inflammation in 3T3-L1 cells without cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, taking normal diet and orlistat mice as references, AAM supplementation improved blood lipid levels and adipocyte degeneration, promoted beneficial gut microbial growth, and maintained lipid metabolism in HFD mice. Furthermore, AAM activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, accompanied by the regulation of adipogenic transcription factors and their target genes in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our data demonstrated that AAM exhibits anti-adipogenic activities that were partially mediated by the AMPK pathway and gut microbiota regulation. This study provides new insight into the regulation of lipid metabolism by AAM and suggests that AAM has potential therapeutic effects on hyperlipidemia.

## Sulfated modification enhances the modulatory effect of yam polysaccharide on gut microbiota in cyclophosphamide-treated mice.
 11.06.2021, _R Huang, J Xie, X Liu, M Shen_


Our previous study has demonstrated that sulfated yam polysaccharide (SCYP) had a stronger immunomodulatory activity than yam polysaccharide (CYP). In order to investigate how the sulfated modification influence the immunological activity of CYP, this research was mainly focused on the study of gut microbiotal. The results showed that SCYP treatment could increase the digestive enzyme activities of colon contents and restore the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in mice that were decreased by cyclophosphamide (Cy) treatment. Furthermore, SCYP treatment could modulate the structure of the gut microbiota, which was mainly manifest in the result of an increased abundances of Lactobacillus, Bacteroidetes and Akkermansia, and the decrease of the proportion of Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia in the microbial community. Diversity and overall structure of microbial community were also improved by SCYP treatment based on alpha-diversity and beta-diversity analysis results. The biomarkers of the gut microbial that were regulated by SCYP have been identified by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe). These findings further indicate that there is great potential for SCYP to be developed into prebiotics or functional foods.

## Rumen Microbiota of Tibetan Sheep (Ovis aries) Adaptation to Extremely Cold Season on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
 12.06.2021, _Q Fan, X Cui, Z Wang, S Chang, M Wanapat, T Yan, F Hou_


The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is characterized by low temperatures and hypoxia, and this feature is more obvious in the winter. However, it is not clear how Tibetan sheep adapt to extreme cold climates. To address this, we used physiological methods combined with next-generation sequencing technology to explore the differences in growth performance, forage nutrient digestion, serum biochemical indexes, and rumen microbial communities of Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) between the summer and winter. In the summer, owing to the high nutritional quality of the forage, the Tibetan sheep showed enhanced forage degradation and fermentation though increased counts of important bacteria in the rumen, such as Bacteroidetes, Prevotella_1, Prevotellaceae_UCG-003, Ruminococcus_1, Saccharofermentans, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, to improve the growth performance and increase serum immunity and antioxidant status. In the winter, owing to the low nutritional quality of the forage, the Tibetan sheep presented low values of forage degradation and fermentation indicators. The relative abundance of Firmicutes, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, microbial diversity, interactive activity between microorganisms, and metabolism were significantly increased, implying that the rumen microbiota could promote the decomposition of forage biomass and the maintenance of energy when forage nutritional value was insufficient in the winter. Our study helps in elucidating the mechanism by which Tibetan sheep adapt to the high-altitude harsh environments, from the perspective of the rumen microbiota.

## Phytohormones selectively affect plant parasitic nematodes associated with Arabidopsis roots.
 11.06.2021, _MM Sikder, M Vestergård, T Kyndt, EN Kudjordjie, M Nicolaisen_


Phytohormones may affect plant-nematode interactions directly as chemo-attractants or -repellents, or indirectly through the root-associated microbiome or through host defense mechanisms. However, the exact roles of phytohormones in these complex plant-soil-nematode interactions are not well understood. We used Arabidopsis thaliana mutants impaired in phytohormone synthesis or sensitivity to elucidate their role in root-nematode interactions. As root-associated microorganisms may modulate these interactions, we explored correlations between the relative abundances of root-associated nematodes, and bacteria and fungi using amplicon sequencing. We found distinct shifts in relative abundances of a range of nematode taxa in the Arabidopsis thaliana phytohormone mutants. The root knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla, a sedentary endoparasitic species that is in intimate contact with the host, was highly enriched in jasmonate, salicylic acid and strigolactone impaired lines, and in an ethylene insensitive line. Positive or negative correlations between specific microbial and nematode taxa were observed, but, as the inference of causal relationships between microbiome responses and effects on nematode communities is premature, this should be studied in detail in future studies. In conclusion, genetic derailment of hormonal balances generally rendered plants vulnerable to endoparasitic nematode attack. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that this effect may be partially modulated by the associated microbiome.

## Bacterial Community Structure and the Dominant Species in Imported Pollens for Artificial Pollination.
 11.06.2021, _SH Kim, H Do, G Cho, DR Kim, YS Kwak_


Pollination is an essential process for plants to carry on their generation. Pollination is carried out in various ways depending on the type of plant species. Among them, pollination by insect pollinator accounts for the most common. However, these pollinators have be decreasing in population density due to environmental factors. Therefore, use of artificial pollination is increasing. However, there is a lack of information on microorganisms present in the artificial pollens. We showed the composition of bacteria structure present in the artificial pollens of apple, kiwifruit, peach and pear, and contamination of high-risk pathogens was investigated. Acidovorax spp., Pantoea spp., Erwinia spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Xanthomonas spp., which are classified as potential high-risk pathogens, have been identified in imported pollens. This study presented the pollen-associated bacterial community structure, and the results are expected to be foundation for strengthening biosecurity in orchard industry.

## Structure and variation of root-associated bacterial communities of Cyperus rotundus L. in the contaminated soils around Pb/Zn mine sites.
 11.06.2021, _P Gao, B Song, R Xu, X Sun, H Lin, F Xu, B Li, W Sun_


Soil contamination due to mining activities is a great concern in China. Although the effects of mining pollution resulting in changes of soil characteristics and the microbiome have been documented, studies on the responses of plant root-associated microbial assemblages remain scarce. In this work, we collected bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and root endosphere samples of Cyperus rotundus L (Cyp) plants from two Pb/Zn mines, of which, one was abandoned (SL) and the other was active (GD), to investigate the bacterial community responses across different site contamination levels and Cyp plant compartments. For comparison, one unpolluted site (SD) was included. Results revealed that soils from the SL and GD sites were seriously contaminated by metal(loid)s, including Pb, Zn, As, and Sb. Bacterial richness and diversity depended on the sampling site and plant compartment. All sample types from the SL site had the lowest bacterial diversities and their bacterial communities also exhibited distinct patterns compared to GD and SD samples. As for the specific sampling site, bacterial communities from the root endosphere exhibited different patterns from those in bulk and rhizosphere soil. Compared to the GD and SD sites, the root endosphere and the rhizosphere soil from the SL site shared core microbes, including Halomonas, Pelagibacterium, and Chelativorans, suggesting that they play key roles in Cyp plant survival in such harsh environments.

## Antibiotic Resistance Gene-Carrying Plasmid Spreads into the Plant Endophytic Bacteria using Soil Bacteria as Carriers.
 11.06.2021, _H Xu, Z Chen, R Huang, Y Cui, Q Li, Y Zhao, X Wang, D Mao, Y Luo, H Ren_


Applications of animal manure and treated wastewater could enrich antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the plant microbiome. However, the mechanistic studies of the transmission of ARB and ARGs from the environment to plant endophytic bacteria were few. Herein, a genetically engineered fluorescent Escherichia coli harboring a conjugative RP4 plasmid that carries three ARGs was used to trace its spread into Arabidopsis thaliana interior in a tetracycline-amended hydroponic system in the absence or presence of a simulated soil bacterial community. Confocal microscope observation demonstrated that E. coli was internalized into plant tissues and the carried RP4 plasmid was transferred into plant endophytic bacteria. More importantly, we observed that soil bacteria inhibited the internalization of E. coli but substantially promoted RP4 plasmid spread into the plant microbiome. The altered RP4-carrying bacterial community composition in the plant microbiome and the increased core-shared RP4-carrying bacteria number between plant interior and exterior in the presence of soil bacteria collectively confirmed that soil bacteria, especially Proteobacteria, might capture RP4 from E. coli and then translocate into plant microbiome, resulting in the increased RP4 plasmid spread in the plant endophytes. Overall, our findings provided important insights into the dissemination of ARB and ARGs from the environment to the plant microbiome.

## Flavonoids and saponins in plant rhizospheres: roles, dynamics, and the potential for agriculture.
 11.06.2021, _A Sugiyama_


Plants are in constant interaction with a myriad of soil microorganisms in the rhizosphere, an area of soil in close contact with plant roots. Recent research has highlighted the importance of plant specialized metabolites (PSMs) in shaping and modulating the rhizosphere microbiota; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment and function of the microbiota mostly remain unaddressed. Flavonoids and saponins are a group of PSMs whose biosynthetic pathways have largely been revealed. Although these PSMs are abundantly secreted into the rhizosphere and exert various functions, the secretion mechanisms have not been clarified. This review summarizes the roles of flavonoids and saponins in the rhizosphere with a special focus on interactions between plants and the rhizosphere microbiota. Furthermore, this review introduces recent advancements in the dynamics of these metabolites in the rhizosphere and indicates potential applications of PSMs for crop production and discusses perspectives in this emerging research field.

## Host specific endophytic microbiome diversity and associated functions in three varieties of scented black rice are dependent on growth stage.
 15.06.2021, _KM Singha, B Singh, P Pandey_


The compositional and functional role of the endophytic bacterial community, associated with black scented rice, in correlation with its antioxidant property has been elucidated. Community dissimilarity analysis confirmed the overlapping of community in shoot and root tissues at the young stage, but not in mature plants. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum, in which Agrobacterium, Pleomorphomonas, Bradyrhizobium, Novasphingobium, Caulobacter were the most abundant genera, followed by Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetes in all three different varieties of the black rice. The antioxidant activity of mature plants was found to be higher in comparison to young plants. Intrinsically, the relative abundance of Pleomorphomonas and Streptomyces was positively correlated with total phenol content, while Gemmata, unclassified Pirellulaceae, unclassified Stramenopiles positively correlated with total flavonoid content and negatively correlated with Free radical scavenging activity. Accordingly, functional metagenome analysis of the endophytic microbiome revealed that naringenin -3-dioxygenase and anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase for phenylpropanoid (flavonoid and anthocyanin) synthesis were abundant in the endophytic microbiome of mature plants. Specific enrichment of the antioxidant producing genes in the mature plant endophytic microbiome was assigned to some bacteria such as Streptomyces, Pantoea which might have contributed to the common pathway of flavonoid synthesis. The genomes of endophytic isolates Kluyvera sp.PO2S7, Bacillus subtilis AMR1 and Enterobacter sp. SES19 were sequenced and annotated, and were found to have genes for phenylpropanoid synthesis in their genomes.

## Constraining PERMANOVA and LDM to within-set comparisons by projection improves the efficiency of analyses of matched sets of microbiome data.
 13.06.2021, _Z Zhu, GA Satten, C Mitchell, YJ Hu_


Matched-set data arise frequently in microbiome studies. For example, we may collect pre- and post-treatment samples from a set of individuals, or use important confounding variables to match data from case participants to one or more control participants. Thus, there is a need for statistical methods for data comprised of matched sets, to test hypotheses against traits of interest (e.g., clinical outcomes or environmental factors) at the community level and/or the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level. Optimally, these methods should accommodate complex data such as those with unequal sample sizes across sets, confounders varying within sets, and continuous traits of interest.

## Interrogating the bovine reproductive tract metagenomes using culture-independent approaches: a systematic review.
 10.06.2021, _CT Ong, C Turni, PJ Blackall, G Boe-Hansen, BJ Hayes, AE Tabor_


Undesirable microbial infiltration into the female bovine reproductive tracts, for example during calving or mating, is likely to disturb the commensal microflora. Persistent establishment and overgrowth of certain pathogens induce reproductive diseases, render the female bovine reproductive tract unfavourable for pregnancy or can result in transmission to the foetus, leading to death and abortion or birth abnormalities. This review of culture-independent metagenomics studies revealed that normal microflora in the female bovine reproductive tract is reasonably consistently dominated by bacteria from the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, following by Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Tenericutes. Reproductive disease development in the female bovine reproductive tract was demonstrated across multiple studies to be associated with high relative abundances of bacteria from the phyla Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. Reduced bacterial diversity in the reproductive tract microbiome in some studies of cows diagnosed with reproductive diseases also indicated an association between dysbiosis and bovine reproductive health. Nonetheless, the bovine genital tract microbiome remains underexplored, and this is especially true for the male genital tract. Future research should focus on the functional aspects of the bovine reproductive tract microbiomes, for example their contributions to cattle fertility and susceptibility towards reproductive diseases.

Profiling of oral microbiota has traditionally been performed using conventional methods. These methods are relatively time-consuming and labor-intensive. Metagenomic analysis of oral microbiota using high-speed next-generation sequencing is a highly promising technology. However, it is expensive. This study sought to develop a simple and cost-effective profiling method for oral microbiota using 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes.

## Organoids and organs-on-chips: Insights into human gut-microbe interactions.
 11.06.2021, _J Puschhof, C Pleguezuelos-Manzano, H Clevers_


The important and diverse roles of the gut microbiota in human health and disease are increasingly recognized. The difficulty of inferring causation from metagenomic microbiome sequencing studies and from mouse-human interspecies differences has prompted the development of sophisticated in vitro models of human gut-microbe interactions. Here, we review recent advances in the co-culture of microbes with intestinal and colonic epithelia, comparing the rapidly developing fields of organoids and organs-on-chips with other standard models. We describe how specific individual processes by which microbes and epithelia interact can be recapitulated in vitro. Using examples of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, we highlight the advantages of each culture model and discuss current trends and future possibilities to build more complex co-cultures.

## Decay of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and surrogates in aquatic environments.
 15.06.2021, _L Sala-Comorera, LJ Reynolds, NA Martin, JJ O'Sullivan, WG Meijer, NF Fletcher_


The introduction of SARS-CoV-2 containing human stool and sewage into water bodies may raise public health concerns. However, assessment of public health risks by faecally contaminated water is limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the persistence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in water. In the present study the decay rates of viable infectious SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA were determined in river and seawater at 4 and 20°C. These decay rates were compared to S. typhimurium bacteriophage MS2 and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV). Persistence of viable SARS-CoV-2 was temperature dependent, remaining infectious for significantly longer periods of time in both freshwater and seawater at 4°C than at 20°C. T90 for infectious SARS-CoV-2 in river water was 2.3 days and 3.8 days at 20°C and 4°C, respectively. The T90 values were 1.1 days and 2.2 days in seawater at 20°C and 4°C, respectively. In contrast to the rapid inactivation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in river and sea water, viral RNA was relatively stable. The RNA decay rates were increased in non-sterilised river and seawater, presumably due to the presence of microbiota. The decay rates of infectious MS2, MS2 RNA and PMMoV RNA differed significantly from the decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting that their use as surrogate markers for the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment is limited.
