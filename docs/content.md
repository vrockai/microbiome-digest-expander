Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) has been used with the therapeutic intent to change the functions of the gut microbial community in metabolism and host immunity. For most of these therapies, the recipients are not given antibiotics to eliminate the microbial community prior to transplant with donor fecal microbes resulting in the initial gut microbial community following FMT consisting of a consortium of donor and recipient microbes. The detailed analysis of the fecal samples from these FMT over time provides a unique opportunity to study the changes in the gut microbial strain community that occurs following the introduction of new microbial strains (donor) into an established community (recipient).

## Microbiome complexity shapes metabolism.
 21.09.2022, _L Litichevskiy, CA Thaiss_


Equipped with a novel isolator-housed metabolic cage system, a study in PLOS Biology assessed how the metabolism of mice harboring a defined minimal microbial community (OligoMM12) differs from that of germ-free and conventionally colonized mice.
