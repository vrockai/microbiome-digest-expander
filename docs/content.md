## Modulating host gene expression via gut microbiome-microRNA interplay to treat human diseases.
 18.08.2021, _D Mody, V Verma, V Rani_


The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract hosts trillions of microbial inhabitants involved in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, dysbiosis of which provokes a motley of pathogenic and autoimmune disorders. While the mechanisms by which the microbiota modulates human health are manifold, their liberated metabolites from ingested dietary supplements play a crucial role by bidirectionally regulating the expression of micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs). miRNAs are small endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that have been confirmed to be involved in an interplay with microbiota to regulate host gene expression. This comprehensive review focuses on key principles of miRNAs, their regulation, and crosstalk with gut microbiota to influence host gene expression in various human disorders, by bringing together important recent findings centric around miRNA-microbiota interactions in diseases along various axis of the gut with other organs. We also attempt to lay emphasis on exploiting the avenues of gut-directed miRNA therapeutics using rudimentary dietary supplements to regulate abnormal host gene expression in diseases, opening doors to an accessible and economical therapeutic strategy.

## The Cancer Microbiome: Recent Highlights and Knowledge Gaps.
 17.08.2021, _RJ Knippel, JL Drewes, CL Sears_


knowledge of the human microbiome, which is likely a critical factor in the initiation, progression, and prognosis of multiple forms of cancer, is rapidly expanding. In this review, we focus on recent investigations to discern putative, causative microbial species and the microbiome composition and structure currently associated with procarcinogenesis and tumorigenesis at select body sites. We specifically highlight forms of cancer, gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal, that have significant bacterial associations and well-defined experimental evidence with the aim of generating directions for future experimental and translational investigations to develop a clearer understanding of the multifaceted mechanisms by which microbiota affect cancer formation. SIGNIFICANCE: Emerging and, for some cancers, strong experimental and translational data support the contribution of the microbiome to cancer biology and disease progression. Disrupting microbiome features and pathways contributing to cancer may provide new approaches to improving cancer outcomes in patients.
