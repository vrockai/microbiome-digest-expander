## Nurturing futures through the maternal microbiome.
 07.08.2024, _R Pala, K Kenny_


Recently there has been growing recognition of the productive and protective features of our microbial kin and the crucial role of 'commensal' microbes in supporting and sustaining health. Current microbiological and pharmacological literature is increasingly highlighting the role of maternal gut microbiomes in the long-term health of both mothers and children. Drawing on the information and advice directed towards Australian parents from conception through the first years of a child's life, we consider its messaging about the need to secure for the foetus/future-child an enduring, optimal state of health by managing the maternal microbiome. We argue that this post-Pasteurian trend gives rise to relations of care that are, at once, newly collective and more-than-human-but also disciplinary in ways that position the maternal microbiome as a new site of scrutiny that disproportionately responsibilises and burdens mothers. We notice how microbiome research is used both to reframe motherhood as a form of micro(bial)-management and to maintain motherhood as a medicalised process. The feminist and more-than-human potential that this research can provide is missing in the way these resources are presented to parents.

## Boosting pro-vitamin A content and bioaccessibility in leaves by combining engineered biosynthesis and storage pathways with high-light treatments.
 09.08.2024, _L Morelli, P Perez-Colao, D Reig-Lopez, X Di, B Llorente, M Rodriguez-Concepcion_


Biofortification of green leafy vegetables with pro-vitamin A carotenoids, such as β-carotene, has remained challenging to date. Here, we combined two strategies to achieve this goal. One of them involves producing β-carotene in the cytosol of leaf cells to avoid the negative impacts on photosynthesis derived from changing the balance of carotenoids and chlorophylls in chloroplasts. The second approach involves the conversion of chloroplasts into non-photosynthetic, carotenoid-overaccumulating chromoplasts in leaves agroinfiltrated or infected with constructs encoding the bacterial phytoene synthase crtB, leaving other non-engineered leaves of the plant to sustain normal growth. A combination of these two strategies, referred to as strategy C (for cytosolic production) and strategy P (for plastid conversion mediated by crtB), resulted in a 5-fold increase in the amount of β-carotene in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Following several attempts to further improve β-carotene leaf contents by metabolic engineering, hormone treatments and genetic screenings, it was found that promoting the proliferation of plastoglobules with increased light-intensity treatments not only improved β-carotene accumulation but it also resulted in a much higher bioaccessibility. The combination of strategies C and P together with a more intense light treatment increased the levels of accessible β-carotene 30-fold compared to controls. We further demonstrated that stimulating plastoglobule proliferation with strategy P, but also with a higher-light treatment alone, also improved β-carotene contents and bioaccessibility in edible lettuce (Lactuca sativa) leaves.

## Gut microbial composition is altered in sarcopenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies.
 08.08.2024, _X Mai, S Yang, Q Chen, K Chen_


_Sarcopenia, Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Bacteria_
Increasing evidence has shown that gut microbiota (GM) was involved in the pathophysiology of musculoskeletal disorders through multiple pathways such as protein anabolism, chronic inflammation and immunity, and imbalanced metabolism. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of human studies to evaluate GM diversity differences between individuals with and without sarcopenia, and explore bacteria with potential to become biomarkers. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library were systematically searched from inception to February 16, 2024. Studies were included if they (1) sampled adults with sarcopenia, and (2) performed GM analysis and reported α-diversity, β-diversity or relative abundance. The methodological quality of included studies and the certainty of evidence were assessed through the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group system, respectively. Weighted standardized mean differences (SMDs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for α-diversity indices using a fixed-effects and a random-effects model. Beta diversity and the relative abundance of GM were summarized qualitatively. A total of 19 studies involving 6,565 participants were included in this study. Compared with controls, significantly moderate decrease in microbial richness in participants with sarcopenia were found (Chao1: SMD = -0.44; 95%CI, -0.64 to -0.23, I2 = 57.23%, 13 studies; observed species: SMD = -0.68; 95%CI, -1.00 to -0.37, I2 = 66.07%, 5 studies; ACE index: SMD = -0.30; 95%CI, -0.56 to -0.04, I2 = 8.12%, 4 studies), with very low certainty of evidence. Differences in β-diversity were consistently observed in 84.6% of studies and 97.3% of participants. The detailed analysis of the gut microbial differential abundance identified a loss of Prevotellaceae, Prevotella, and Megamonas in sarcopenia compared with non-sarcopenia. In conclusion, sarcopenia was found to be associated with reduced richness of GM, and supplementing intestinal bacteria described above may contribute to preventing and treating this muscle disease. The research protocol was registered and approved in PROSPERO (CRD42023412849).

The lung is recognized as a site for initiating the formation of self-antigen and autoimmune responses in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aimed to investigate the association of upper respiratory microbiota with RA, autoantibody production, and disease activity. Forty-six patients with RA and 17 controls were examined. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were sequenced for microbiome profiling using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The microbial diversity and relative abundance were compared between RA patients and controls. Correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between microbial abundance and clinical markers such as autoantibodies and disease activity. Microbial diversity analysis revealed no major differences between RA patients and healthy controls. However, beta diversity analysis indicated a subtle distinction in microbial composition (unweighted UniFrac distance) between the two groups (P = 0.03), hinting at a minor subset of microbiota associated with disease status. Differential abundance analysis uncovered specific taxa at various taxonomic levels, including Saccharibacteria (TM7) [O-1] (PFDR = 2.53 × 10-2), TM7 [F-1] (PFDR = 5.20 × 10-3), Microbacterium (PFDR = 3.37 × 10-4), and Stenotrophomonas (PFDR = 2.57 × 10-3). The relative abundance of ten genera correlated significantly with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody levels (PFDR &lt; 0.05) and 11 genera were significantly associated with disease activity markers, including ESR, CRP, DAS28-ESR, and DAS-CRP (PFDR &lt; 0.05). In particular, Saccharibacteria TM7 [G-3] and Peptostreptococcaceae [XI] [G-1] were correlated with all disease activity biomarkers. Dysbiosis in the upper respiratory mucosa is associated with RA, anti-CCP antibody levels, and disease activity.

β-Lactam antibiotics are a class of antibiotics commonly used to treat bacterial infections. However, the effects of β-lactam antibiotics on term neonatal intestinal flora have not been fully elucidated. Hospitalized full-term newborns receiving β-lactam antibiotics formed the antibiotic group (n = 67), while those without antibiotic treatment comprised the non-antibiotic group (n = 47). A healthy group included healthy full-term newborns (n = 16). Stool samples were collected for 16 S rDNA sequencing to analyze gut microbiota variations. Further investigation was carried out within the β-lactam antibiotic group, exploring the effects of antibiotic use on the newborns' gut microbiota in relation to the duration and type of antibiotic administration, delivery method, and feeding practices. The antibiotic group exhibited significant difference of microbial community composition compared to the other groups. Genera like Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Alistipes, and Aeromonas were enriched, while Escherichia-Shigella, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Bifidobacterium, and Parabacteroides were reduced. Klebsiella negatively correlated with Escherichia-Shigella, positively with Enterobacter, while Escherichia-Shigella negatively correlated with Enterococcus and Streptococcus. Regardless of neonatal age, β-lactam antibiotics induced an elevated abundance of Klebsiella and Enterococcus. The impact on gut microbiota varied with the duration and type of antibiotic (cefotaxime or ampicillin/sulbactam). Compared to vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery after β-lactam treatment heightened the abundance of Klebsiella, Enterobacteriaceae_Unclassified, Lactobacillales_Unclassified, and Pectobacterium. Feeding patterns minimally influenced β-lactam-induced alterations. In conclusion, β-lactam antibiotic treatment for neonatal pneumonia and sepsis markedly disrupted intestinal microbiota, favoring Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Alistipes, and Aeromonas. The impact of β-lactam varied by duration, type, and delivery method, emphasizing heightened disruptions post-cesarean delivery.

Plastics pose a considerable challenge to aquatic ecosystems because of their increasing global usage and non-biodegradable properties. Coastal plastic debris can persist in ecosystems; however, its effects on resident organisms remain unclear. A metagenomic analysis of the isopoda Ligia, collected from clean (Nae-do, ND) and plastic-contaminated sites (Maemul-do, MD) in South Korea, was conducted to clarify the effects of microplastic contamination on the gut microbiota. Ligia gut microbiota's total operational taxonomic units were higher in ND than in MD. Alpha diversity did not differ significantly between the two Ligia gut microbial communities collected from ND and MD, although richness (Observed species) was lower in MD than in ND. Proteobacteria (67.47%, ND; 57.30%, MD) and Bacteroidetes (13.63%, ND; 20.76%, MD) were the most abundant phyla found at both sites. Significant different genera in Ligia from EPS-polluted sites were observed. Functional gene analysis revealed that 19 plastic degradation-related genes, including those encoding hydrogenase, esterase, and carboxylesterase, were present in the gut microbes of Ligia from MD, indicating the potential role of the Ligia gut microbiota in plastic degradation. This study provides the first comparative field evidence of the gut microbiota dynamics of plastic detritus consumers in marine ecosystems.

In this study, a probiotic mixture (Honeybeeotic) consisting of seven bacterial strains isolated from a unique population of honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica) was used. That honeybee population was located in the Roti Abbey locality of the Marche Region in Italy, an area isolated from human activities, and genetic contamination from other honeybee populations. The aim was to investigate the effects of this probiotic mixture on the innate immunity and intestinal microbiome of healthy common honeybees in two hives of the same apiary. Hive A received a diet of 50% glucose syrup, while hive B received the same syrup supplemented with the probiotics, both administered daily for 1 month. To determine whether the probiotic altered the immune response, phenoloxidase activity and hemolymph cellular subtype count were investigated. Additionally, metagenomic approaches were used to analyze the effects on gut microbiota composition and function, considering the critical role the gut microbiota plays in modulating host physiology.

Antimicrobial resistance is a global health concern. As such, there have been increased efforts to monitor and standardize antimicrobial prescribing practices in humans and domestic animals. In contrast, there is relatively little known about specific prescribing practices in wild animals despite the wide use of antimicrobials and other microbial interventions, such as probiotics to treat captive wildlife. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine current antimicrobial and probiotic use from a cross-section of wildlife rehabilitation facilities in the United States. An anonymous electronic survey was sent to 105 United States permitted wildlife facilities to collect information about admissions, current antimicrobial and probiotic use practices, and current staff knowledge and attitudes surrounding antimicrobial resistance and probiotic effectiveness. Respondents from over 50% of facilities participated in the survey (54/105), including 45 facilities that treated birds. All facilities reported using antimicrobials, including some from groups considered critically important for human medicine, for a wide range of medical conditions and prophylaxis. Among antibiotics, enrofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were the most commonly used. Antifungals were not as widespread, but itraconazole was the most commonly used. Over 75% of respondents said that their facilities would benefit from having standardized antimicrobial guidelines in place. Probiotics were also used in more than 50% of facilities, but there was notable disparity in opinions regarding their efficacy. The results of this survey are a first step towards understanding antimicrobial and probiotic use practices in the treatment of captive wildlife and developing an antimicrobial stewardship program for wildlife rehabilitation.
