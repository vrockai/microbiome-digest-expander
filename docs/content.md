Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is the most common oral cavity cancer, and p16 immunohistochemistry is an exact and available tool in the prognostic and predictive characterization of squamous cell cancers in the head and neck. Microorganisms have a close relationship with the development of TSCC. However, the association between oral bacteria and p16 status has not been well defined in the case of TSCC. Compared with traditional clinical microbial collection methods, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples have several advantages.

Reversible genomic DNA inversions control the expression of numerous gut bacterial molecules, but how this impacts disease remains uncertain. By analyzing metagenomic samples from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohorts, we identified multiple invertible regions where a particular orientation correlated with disease. These include the promoter of polysaccharide A (PSA) of Bacteroides fragilis, which induces regulatory T cells (Tregs) and ameliorates experimental colitis. The PSA promoter was mostly oriented "OFF" in IBD patients, which correlated with increased B. fragilis-associated bacteriophages. Similarly, in mice colonized with a healthy human microbiota and B. fragilis, induction of colitis caused a decline of PSA in the "ON" orientation that reversed as inflammation resolved. Monocolonization of mice with B. fragilis revealed that bacteriophage infection increased the frequency of PSA in the "OFF" orientation, causing reduced PSA expression and decreased Treg cells. Altogether, we reveal dynamic bacterial phase variations driven by bacteriophages and host inflammation, signifying bacterial functional plasticity during disease.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) involves systemic changes in peripheral blood and gut microbiota, but the current understanding is incomplete. Herein, we conducted a multi-omics analysis of fecal and blood samples obtained from an observational cohort including MDD patients (n = 99) and healthy control (HC, n = 50). 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota showed structural alterations in MDD, as characterized by increased Enterococcus. Metagenomics sequencing of gut microbiota showed substantial functional alterations including upregulation in the superpathway of the glyoxylate cycle and fatty acid degradation and downregulation in various metabolic pathways in MDD. Plasma metabolomics revealed decreased amino acids and bile acids, together with increased sphingolipids and cholesterol esters in MDD. Notably, metabolites involved in arginine and proline metabolism were decreased while sphingolipid metabolic pathway were increased. Mass cytometry analysis of blood immune cell subtypes showed rises in proinflammatory immune subsets and declines in anti-inflammatory immune subsets in MDD. Furthermore, our findings revealed disease severity-related factors of MDD. Interestingly, we classified MDD into two immune subtypes that were highly correlated with disease relapse. Moreover, we established discriminative signatures that differentiate MDD from HC. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the MDD pathogenesis and provide valuable resources for the discovery of biomarkers.

Chondroitin sulfate (CS) has widely been used as a symptomatic slow-acting drug or a dietary supplement for the treatment and prevention of osteoarthritis. However, CS could not be absorbed after oral intake due to its polyanionic nature and large molecular weight. Gut microbiota has recently been proposed to play a pivotal role in the metabolism of drugs and nutrients. Nonetheless, how CS is degraded by the human gut microbiota has not been fully characterized. In the present study, we demonstrated that each human gut microbiota was characterized with a unique capability for CS degradation. Degradation and fermentation of CS by the human gut microbiota produced significant amounts of unsaturated CS oligosaccharides (CSOSs) and short-chain fatty acids. To uncover which microbes were responsible for CS degradation, we isolated a total of 586 bacterial strains with a potential CS-degrading capability from 23 human fecal samples. Bacteroides salyersiae was a potent species for CS degradation in the human gut microbiota and produced the highest amount of CSOSs as compared to other well-recognized CS-degraders, including Bacteroides finegoldii, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, and Bacteroides ovatus. Genomic analysis suggested that B. salyersiae was armed with multiple carbohydrate-active enzymes that could potentially degrade CS into CSOSs. By using a spent medium assay, we further demonstrated that the unsaturated tetrasaccharide (udp4) produced by the primary degrader B. salyersiae could serve as a "public goods" molecule for the growth of Bacteroides stercoris, a secondary CS-degrader that was proficient at fermenting CSOSs but not CS. Taken together, our study provides insights into the metabolism of CS by the human gut microbiota, which has promising implications for the development of medical and nutritional therapies for osteoarthritis.

Gut dysbiosis induced by oxygen and reactive oxygen species may be related to the development of inflammation, resulting in metabolic syndrome and associated-conditions in the gut. Here we show that elemental iron can serve as an antioxidant and reverse the oxygen-induced dysbiosis. Fecal samples from three healthy donors were fermented with elemental iron and/or oxygen. 16S rRNA analysis revealed that elemental iron reversed the oxygen-induced disruption of Shannon index diversity of the gut microbiota.The bacteria lacking enzymatic antioxidant systems also increased after iron treatment. Inter-individual differences, which corresponded to iron oxidation patterns, were observed for the tested donors. Gut bacteria responding to oxygen and iron treatments were identified as guilds, among which, Escherichia-Shigella was promoted by oxygen and depressed by elemental iron, while changes in bacteria such as Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Eubacterium, Ruminococcaceae, Flavonifractor, Oscillibacter, and Lachnospiraceae were reversed by elemental iron after oxygen treatment. Short-chain fatty acid production was inhibited by oxygen and this effect was partially reversed by elemental iron. These results suggested that elemental iron can regulate the oxygen/ROS state and protect the gut microbiota from oxidative stress.

## Fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorates abdominal obesity through inhibiting microbiota-mediated intestinal barrier damage and inflammation in mice.
 28.02.2024, _X Zhu, L Zhao, L Lei, Y Zhu, J Xu, L Liu_


Abdominal obesity (AO), characterized by the excessive abdominal fat accumulation, has emerged as a significant public health concern due to its metabolic complications and escalating prevalence worldwide, posing a more pronounced threat to human health than general obesity. While certain studies have indicated that intestinal flora contributed to diet-induced general obesity, the precise involvement of gut microbiota in the development of AO, specifically the accumulation of abdominal fat, remains inadequately explored. In this study, the 16 S rDNA sequencing was employed to analyze gut flora alterations, and the intestinal microbiota dysbiosis characterized by a vanishing decline of Akkermansia was found in the AO group. Along with notable gut microbiota changes, the intestinal mucosal barrier damage and metabolic inflammation were detected, which collectively promoted metabolic dysregulation in AO. Furthermore, the metabolic inflammation and AO were ameliorated after the intestinal microbiota depletion with antibiotics (ABX) drinking, underscoring a significant involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the progression of AO. More importantly, our findings demonstrated that the transplantation of healthy intestinal flora successfully reversed the gut microbiota dysbiosis, particularly the decline of Akkermansia in the AO group. The gut flora reshaping has led to the repair of gut barrier damage and mitigation of metabolic inflammation, which ultimately ameliorated abdominal fat deposition. Our study established the role of interactions between gut flora, mucus barrier, and metabolic inflammation in the development of AO, thereby offering a theoretical foundation for the clinical application of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a treatment for AO.

## Exploring the modulatory effects of brown seaweed meal and extracts on intestinal microbiota and morphology of broiler chickens challenged with heat stress.
 28.02.2024, _F Oretomiloye, D Adewole_


Brown seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) is known for its prebiotic roles and can improve animal intestinal health by enhancing the growth of beneficial microbes and inhibiting pathogenic ones. However, the gut health-modulatory roles of brown seaweed on chickens challenged with heat stress (HS) are rarely studied. The current study examined the effects of brown seaweed meal (SWM) and extract (SWE) on the ceca microbiota and small intestinal morphology of chickens challenged or unchallenged with HS. Three hundred and thirty-six 1-day-old Ross 308 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to either a thermoneutral (TN; 24 ± 1°C); or HS room (HS; 32-34°C, 8 h/d from d 21 to 27). All birds in each room were randomly allotted to 4 treatments - control (CON), CON + 1 mL/L seaweed extract (SWE) in drinking water, CON + 2 mL/L SWE in drinking water, and CON + 2% seaweed meal (SWM) in feed and raised for 28 d. On d 14 and 28, 12 and 24 birds per treatment group, respectively, were euthanized to collect the ceca content for gut microbiota analysis and small intestinal tissues for morphological examination. On d 14, 2% SWM increased (P = 0.047) the relative abundance of cecal Fecalibacterium and all brown seaweed treatments improved jejunal villus height (VH) and VH:CD compared to the CON diet. On d 28, HS significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) ileal VH, VW, and VH:CD, and duodenal VH and VH:CD. Among the HS group, 2% SWM and 2 mL/L SWE significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Sellimonas, and Fournierella, compared to the CON diet. HS birds fed with 2% SWM had higher ileal VH and VH:CD compared to other treatments. In summary, SWM and SWE enhanced the abundance of beneficial microbes and improved small intestinal morphology among HS chickens. This implies that seaweed could potentially alleviate HS-induced intestinal impairment in chickens.

Plants and microbes communicate to collaborate to stop pests, scavenge nutrients, and react to environmental change. Microbiota consisting of thousands of species interact with each other and plants using a large chemical language that is interpreted by complex regulatory networks. In this work, we develop modular interkingdom communication channels, enabling bacteria to convey environmental stimuli to plants. We introduce a "sender device" in Pseudomonas putida and Klebsiella pneumoniae, that produces the small molecule p-coumaroyl-homoserine lactone (pC-HSL) when the output of a sensor or circuit turns on. This molecule triggers a "receiver device" in the plant to activate gene expression. We validate this system in Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum tuberosum (potato) grown hydroponically and in soil, demonstrating its modularity by swapping bacteria that process different stimuli, including IPTG, aTc and arsenic. Programmable communication channels between bacteria and plants will enable microbial sentinels to transmit information to crops and provide the building blocks for designing artificial consortia.

The final step in the anaerobic decomposition of biopolymers is methanogenesis. Rice field soils are a major anthropogenic source of methane, with straw commonly used as a fertilizer in rice farming. Here, we aimed to decipher the structural and functional responses of the methanogenic community to rice straw addition during an extended anoxic incubation (120 days) of Philippine paddy soil. The research combined process measurements, quantitative real-time PCR and RT-PCR of particular biomarkers (16S rRNA, mcrA), and meta-omics (environmental genomics and transcriptomics).

To assess the possible impact of climatic variation on microbial community composition in organic winemaking, we employed a metabarcoding approach to scrutinize the microbiome in a commercial, organic, Pinot noir wine production system that utilizes autochthonous fermentation. We assessed microbial composition across two vintages (2018 and 2021) using biological replicates co-located at the same winery. Microbial dynamics were monitored over four important fermentation time points and correlated with contemporaneous climate data. Bacterial (RANOSIM = 0.4743, p = 0.0001) and fungal (RANOSIM = 0.4738, p = 0.0001) compositions were different in both vintages. For bacteria, Lactococcus dominated the diversity associated with the 2018 vintage, while Tatumella dominated the 2021 vintage. For fungal populations, while Saccharomyces were abundant in both vintages, key differences included Starmerella, copious in the 2018 vintage; and Metschnikowia, substantive in the 2021 vintage. Ordination plots correlated the climatic variables with microbial population differences, indicating temperature as a particularly important influence; humidity values also differed significantly between these vintages. Our data illustrates how climatic conditions may influence microbial diversity during winemaking, and further highlights the effect climate change could have on wine production.
