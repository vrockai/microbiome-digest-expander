## Bacterial-Fungal Interactions and Their Impact on Microbial Pathogenesis.
 01.03.2022, _J MacAlpine, N Robbins, LE Cowen_


Microbial communities of the human microbiota exhibit diverse effects on human health and disease. Microbial homeostasis is important for normal physiological functions and changes to the microbiota are associated with many human diseases including diabetes, cancer, and colitis. In addition, there are also many microorganisms that are either commensal or acquired from environmental reservoirs that can cause diverse pathologies. Importantly, the balance between health and disease is intricately connected to how members of the microbiota interact and affect one another's growth and pathogenicity. However, the mechanisms that govern these interactions are only beginning to be understood. In this review, we outline bacterial-fungal interactions in the human body, including examining the mechanisms by which bacteria govern fungal growth and virulence, as well as how fungi regulate bacterial pathogenesis. We summarize advances in the understanding of chemical, physical, and protein-based interactions, and their role in exacerbating or impeding human disease. We focus on the three fungal species responsible for the majority of systemic fungal infections in humans: Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. We conclude by summarizing recent work in mining microbes for novel antimicrobials and antivirulence factors, highlighting the potential of the human microbiota as a rich resource for small molecule discovery.

## Influence of timing of maternal antibiotic administration during caesarean section on infant microbial colonisation: a randomised controlled trial.
 22.11.2021, _T Dierikx, D Berkhout, A Eck, S Tims, J van Limbergen, D Visser, M de Boer, N de Boer, D Touw, M Benninga, N Schierbeek, L Visser, J Knol, G Roeselers, J de Vries, T de Meij_


Revised guidelines for caesarean section (CS) advise maternal antibiotic administration prior to skin incision instead of after umbilical cord clamping, unintentionally exposing the infant to antibiotics antenatally. We aimed to investigate if timing of intrapartum antibiotics contributes to the impairment of microbiota colonisation in CS born infants.

## Predominance of Staphylococcus correlates with wound burden and disease activity in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: a prospective case-control study.
 12.02.2022, _A Reimer-Taschenbrecker, A Künstner, M Hirose, S Hübner, S Gewert, S Ibrahim, H Busch, C Has_


Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is characterized by skin blistering and wounds. To uncover changes in skin and mucosal microbiome related to age and disease progression, and microbiome impact on clinical and inflammatory laboratory parameters, swabs from wounded and unwounded skin, oral mucosa and stool samples of 28 children with RDEB and 28 healthy controls were subjected to 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. Skin microbiome of RDEB patients showed significantly reduced alpha diversity compared to healthy controls and early, age-dependent predominance of Staphylococcus aureus first in wounds, then in unwounded skin. These findings were more pronounced in severe disease with higher abundances of Staphylococcus aureus compared to intermediate disease. Staphylococcus aureus abundance correlated significantly with both acute and chronic wound burden. Changes in oral mucosal and gut microbiome were discrete with no significant differences in alpha diversity. Our findings show that children with RDEB experience skin microbiome changes early in life. Longitudinal studies should confirm that dysbiosis starts in wounds and later extends to unwounded skin. The predominance of Staphylococcus aureus significantly correlates with wound burden and disease activity, and to some extent with systemic inflammation.

## Towards standardized and reproducible research in skin microbiomes.
 01.03.2022, _MO Ruuskanen, D Vats, R Potbhare, A Ravikumar, E Munukka, R Ashma, L Lahti_


Skin is a complex organ serving a critical role as a barrier and mediator of interactions between the human body and its environment. Recent studies have uncovered how resident microbial communities play a significant role in maintaining the normal healthy function of the skin and the immune system. In turn, numerous host-associated and environmental factors influence these communities' composition and diversity across the cutaneous surface. In addition, specific compositional changes in skin microbiota have also been connected to the development of several chronic diseases. The current era of microbiome research is characterized by its reliance on large data sets of nucleotide sequences produced with high-throughput sequencing of sample-extracted DNA. These approaches have yielded new insights into many previously uncharacterized microbial communities. Application of standardized practices in the study of skin microbial communities could help us understand their complex structures, functional capacities, and health associations and increase the reproducibility of the research. Here, we overview the current research in human skin microbiomes and outline challenges specific to their study. Furthermore, we provide perspectives on recent advances in methods, analytical tools, and applications of skin microbiomes in medicine and forensics. This article is protected by copyright.

## Comparability of microbiota of swabbed and spit saliva.
 26.02.2022, _AM Kaan, BW Brandt, MJ Buijs, W Crielaard, BJ Keijser, E Zaura_


In general, saliva is used for microbiota analysis in longitudinal studies, and several collection methods are being used. Using a robust sample collection procedure is important, as it may influence salivary composition. This study explored the comparability of the microbiota of swabbed and spit saliva. Twenty-two females participated in this cross-sectional study. The bacterial composition of the three saliva samples (swab collected by the participant (SW-P), swab collected by the researcher (SW-R), and spit (SP) was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The bacterial composition of the swabbed and the spit saliva was significantly different irrespective of the operator, and Shannon diversity was significantly higher in spit saliva than in SW-P and SW-R. The salivary microbiota of spit and swabbed adult saliva differs significantly. Research on microbial composition therefore requires collection of similar saliva sample types in all study participants.

## A multiple-dimension model for microbiota of patients with colorectal cancer from normal participants and other intestinal disorders.
 26.02.2022, _J Shen, G Jin, Z Zhang, J Zhang, Y Sun, X Xie, T Ma, Y Zhu, Y Du, Y Niu, X Shi_


Gut microbiota is a primary driver of inflammation in the colon and is linked to early colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Thus, a novel and noninvasive microbiome-based model could promote screening in patients at average risk for CRC. Nevertheless, the relevance and effectiveness of microbial biomarkers for noninvasive CRC screening remains unclear, and researchers lack the data to distinguish CRC-related gut microbiome biomarkers from those of other common gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Microbiome-based classification distinguishes patients with CRC from normal participants and excludes other CRC-relevant diseases (e.g., GI bleed, adenoma, bowel diseases, and postoperative). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was 92.2%. Known associations with oral pathogenic features, benefits-generated features, and functional features of CRC were confirmed using the model. Our optimised prediction model was established using large-scale experimental population-based data and other sequence-based faecal microbial community data. This model can be used to identify the high-risk groups and has the potential to become a novel screening method for CRC biomarkers because of its low false-positive rate (FPR) and good stability. KEY POINTS: • A total of 5744 CRC and non-CRC large-scale faecal samples were sequenced, and a model was constructed for CRC discrimination on the basis of the relative abundance of taxonomic and functional features. • This model could identify high-risk groups and become a novel screening method for CRC biomarkers because of its low FPR and good stability. • The association relationship of oral pathogenic features, benefits-generated features, and functional features in CRC was confirmed by the study.

## Rethinking Parkinson Disease: Exploring Gut-Brain Interactions and the Potential Role of Exercise.
 28.02.2022, _K Zapanta, ET Schroeder, BE Fisher_


Although Parkinson disease (PD) has traditionally been considered a disease of the central nervous system, a bidirectional communication system known as the gut-brain axis (GBA) may influence PD pathogenesis. The dual-hit hypothesis proposed that PD is due to peripheral dysregulations to the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis. Since then, further investigation has shown that there are multiple pathologic sources associated with PD. However, dysbiosis plays a critical role in the disease process. Substantial evidence has identified that cardinal motor symptoms of PD and disease progression are associated with dysbiosis. In other neurodegenerative disorders, dysbiosis has been linked to cognition. Non-PD research has shown that exercise can effectively restore the gut microbiota. Likewise, exercise has become a well-established strategy to improve cognitive and motor function in PD. However, despite the interaction between the gut and brain, and the exercise benefits on gut health, no research to date has considered the effects of exercise on the gut microbiota in PD. Therefore, the purpose of this perspective is to explore whether exercise benefits observed in PD may be partly due to restorations to the gut microbiota. First, we will review the GBA and its influence on motor and cognitive function. Next, we will outline evidence regarding exercise-induced restoration of the gut microbiota in non-PD populations. Finally, we will summarize benefits of exercise on motor-cognitive function in PD, proposing that benefits of exercise seen in PD may actually be due to restorations to the gut microbiota. By positing the gut microbiota as a moderator of exercise improvements to motor and cognitive function, we aim to provide a new perspective for physical therapists to prioritize exercise regimens for individuals with PD that can specifically restore the gut microbiota to better-improve PD symptoms and prognosis.

## How to Maintain a Healthy Gut Microbiome in Children with Cancer? Gut Microbiome Association with Diet in Children with Solid Tumors Postchemotherapy.
 01.03.2022, _S Zhou, M Martin, C Powell, KS Sutton, B George, T Olson, KT Konstantinidis, DW Bruner, J Bai_


Malnutrition is a common complication in children with cancer. Cancer treatment and malnutrition can disrupt gut microbiome diversity and composition. The gut microbiome is of broad interest to better understand the mechanisms of malnutrition in cancer therapy. This study aimed to compare the gut microbiome between children with solid tumors postchemotherapy and healthy controls, and investigated the association of the putative microbiome differences with diet. Study participants were 27 children (7-18 years) with solid tumors within the first year after the completion of chemotherapy and 22 healthy controls. The study groups did not have a statistically significant difference in age, race, sex, and body mass index. At study intake, the participants completed the Block Kids Food Screener for dietary intakes in the past week. Fecal specimens were collected and analyzed for the gut microbiome. The cancer and control groups differed in gut microbial β-diversity and abundance analyses. The macronutrient intakes such as carbohydrates, fiber, beta-carotene, and vitamin B6 were positively associated with α-diversity. Children with adequate vitamin B6 had a higher Chao1 diversity index than children with inadequate or excessive intake (p = 0.0004). Children with excessive selenium intake had a trend for higher Pielou's_e index than children with inadequate intake (p = 0.091). Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome is critical among children with cancer. This study provides new insights on the linkages between dietary intakes and the gut microbiome in children with solid tumors postchemotherapy. These findings, if replicated in future independent studies, may help anticipate malnutrition and plan for personalized nutrition approaches during chemotherapy in pediatric cancers.

## The potential utility of fecal (or intestinal) microbiota transplantation in controlling infectious diseases.
 01.03.2022, _R Ghani, BH Mullish, LA Roberts, FJ Davies, JR Marchesi_


The intestinal microbiota is recognized to play a role in the defense against infection, but conversely also acts as a reservoir for potentially pathogenic organisms. Disruption to the microbiome can increase the risk of invasive infection from these organisms; therefore, strategies to restore the composition of the gut microbiota are a potential strategy of key interest to mitigate this risk. Fecal (or Intestinal) Microbiota Transplantation (FMT/IMT), is the administration of minimally manipulated screened healthy donor stool to an affected recipient, and remains the major 'whole microbiome' therapeutic approach at present. Driven by the marked success of using FMT in the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, the potential use of FMT in treating other infectious diseases is an area of active research. In this review, we discuss key examples of this treatment based on recent findings relating to the interplay between microbiota and infection, and potential further exploitations of FMT/IMT.

## Cross-cohort gut microbiome associations with immune checkpoint inhibitor response in advanced melanoma.
 01.03.2022, _KA Lee, AM Thomas, LA Bolte, JR Björk, LK de Ruijter, F Armanini, F Asnicar, A Blanco-Miguez, R Board, N Calbet-Llopart, L Derosa, N Dhomen, K Brooks, M Harland, M Harries, ER Leeming, P Lorigan, P Manghi, R Marais, J Newton-Bishop, L Nezi, F Pinto, M Potrony, S Puig, P Serra-Bellver, HM Shaw, S Tamburini, S Valpione, A Vijay, L Waldron, L Zitvogel, M Zolfo, EGE de Vries, P Nathan, RSN Fehrmann, V Bataille, GAP Hospers, TD Spector, RK Weersma, N Segata_


The composition of the gut microbiome has been associated with clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment, but there is limited consensus on the specific microbiome characteristics linked to the clinical benefits of ICIs. We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples collected before ICI initiation from five observational cohorts recruiting ICI-naive patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma (n = 165). Integrating the dataset with 147 metagenomic samples from previously published studies, we found that the gut microbiome has a relevant, but cohort-dependent, association with the response to ICIs. A machine learning analysis confirmed the link between the microbiome and overall response rates (ORRs) and progression-free survival (PFS) with ICIs but also revealed limited reproducibility of microbiome-based signatures across cohorts. Accordingly, a panel of species, including Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Roseburia spp. and Akkermansia muciniphila, associated with responders was identified, but no single species could be regarded as a fully consistent biomarker across studies. Overall, the role of the human gut microbiome in ICI response appears more complex than previously thought, extending beyond differing microbial species simply present or absent in responders and nonresponders. Future studies should adopt larger sample sizes and take into account the complex interplay of clinical factors with the gut microbiome over the treatment course.

## Intestinal microbiota signatures of clinical response and immune-related adverse events in melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1.
 01.03.2022, _JA McCulloch, D Davar, RR Rodrigues, JH Badger, JR Fang, AM Cole, AK Balaji, M Vetizou, SM Prescott, MR Fernandes, RGF Costa, W Yuan, R Salcedo, E Bahadiroglu, S Roy, RN DeBlasio, RM Morrison, JM Chauvin, Q Ding, B Zidi, A Lowin, S Chakka, W Gao, O Pagliano, SJ Ernst, A Rose, NK Newman, A Morgun, HM Zarour, G Trinchieri, AK Dzutsev_


Ample evidence indicates that the gut microbiome is a tumor-extrinsic factor associated with antitumor response to anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) therapy, but inconsistencies exist between published microbial signatures associated with clinical outcomes. To resolve this, we evaluated a new melanoma cohort, along with four published datasets. Time-to-event analysis showed that baseline microbiota composition was optimally associated with clinical outcome at approximately 1 year after initiation of treatment. Meta-analysis and other bioinformatic analyses of the combined data show that bacteria associated with favorable response are confined within the Actinobacteria phylum and the Lachnospiraceae/Ruminococcaceae families of Firmicutes. Conversely, Gram-negative bacteria were associated with an inflammatory host intestinal gene signature, increased blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and unfavorable outcome. Two microbial signatures, enriched for Lachnospiraceae spp. and Streptococcaceae spp., were associated with favorable and unfavorable clinical response, respectively, and with distinct immune-related adverse effects. Despite between-cohort heterogeneity, optimized all-minus-one supervised learning algorithms trained on batch-corrected microbiome data consistently predicted outcomes to programmed cell death protein-1 therapy in all cohorts. Gut microbial communities (microbiotypes) with nonuniform geographical distribution were associated with favorable and unfavorable outcomes, contributing to discrepancies between cohorts. Our findings shed new light on the complex interaction between the gut microbiome and response to cancer immunotherapy, providing a roadmap for future studies.

## High environmental temperature: Insights into behavioural, neurodevelopmental and gut microbiome changes following gestational exposure in rats.
 01.03.2022, _OE Adebiyi, KO Adigun, AI Adebowale, OS Bukonla_


Adverse effects of changing climate have been associated with increase average global temperature resulting in environmental changes. We set out to investigate effects of environmental stress due to increased heat exposure on developmental milestones, behaviour, gut microbiota and neuroarchitecture in rat pups. Pregnant Wistar rats were held in standard temperature (ST) (26±2 °C; control) or high temperature (HT) (40±2 °C) housing. After parturition, a cohort of the HT group and their pups were moved to the control/ST housing (gestational-only-exposed pup [GE]) while the other subset remained in the HT housing (gestational and postnatal exposed pups [GE+PE]). At different time points, we examined neurodevelopmental milestones and behaviour in the pups. Following sacrifice changes in gut microbiota, neuroarchitecture, cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10), SOD, MDA, expression of MBP, NeUN and GFAP were determined. We observed impaired positioning and placing of paws, prolonged righting reflex, delayed ear opening and significant decreased body weight gain in HT pups when compared with control. We identified Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and noted a significant difference in Firmicutes count between GE and GE+PE pups at P15. Furthermore, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10 and MDA levels were increased in GE and GE+PE pups. There was also a reduction in MBP expression in the HT pups. Taken together, our results revealed a delay in neurodevelopmental milestones in pups exposed to high HT during gestation and post natal life. Pups whose dam were exposed to high HT during gestation also showed some set back but improved over the course of testing.

## Unraveling the microbiota of the fish parasite Pseudoterranova decipiens in codfish (Gadus morhua) reveals a fish-related bacterial community.
 01.03.2022, _G Saelens, K Houf_


Anisakidae, mainly represented by the species Anisakis simplex and Pseudoterranova decipiens, are one of the most commonly zoonotic nematodes present in marine fish species. Apart from public health risks directly linked to the parasite itself, little is known on the effects of the migrating nematodes on the hygienic quality of the fish fillet due to bacteria it carries. In the present study, the cultivated bacterial community on and in individual P. decipiens larvae deriving from codfish is reported. Four isolation media were included and evaluated to increase the bacterial diversity isolated, and identification of the bacterial growth was performed by a combination of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-Of-Flight mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results revealed that the microbiota of P. decipiens larvae comprises both potential spoilage bacteria and human opportunistic pathogens, and that a combined isolation on the general isolation medium tryptone soy agar and a medium supplemented with artificial seawater resulted in the highest bacterial recovery in terms of diversity and enumeration. Dissimilarity analysis also revealed similar, though unique, bacterial communities between nematodes originating from the same fish suggesting that anisakid microbiota compositions are reflections of the microbial assemblages in the fish host as an individual, and that the gut microbiome is diverse within gadoid fish species originating from the same geographical habitat. Future research should, based on the results in the present study, further elaborate on the comparison of the bacterial communities of both the larva and the codfish from which it was isolated, and, explore the extrapolation potential towards other fish and nematode species. Also, the actual degree of risk beyond the simple presence of the parasite due to carriage of opportunistic bacteria should be examined, as well as the nematode's true effect on spoilage.

## Microbial biogeography of the wombat gastrointestinal tract.
 02.03.2022, _R Eisenhofer, E D'Agnese, D Taggart, S Carver, B Penrose_


Most herbivorous mammals have symbiotic microbes living in their gastrointestinal tracts that help with harvesting energy from recalcitrant plant fibre. The bulk of research into these microorganisms has focused on samples collected from faeces, representing the distal region of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, the GI tract in herbivorous mammals is typically long and complex, containing different regions with distinct physico-chemical properties that can structure resident microbial communities. Little work has been done to document GI microbial communities of herbivorous animals at these sites. In this study, we use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbial biogeography along the GI tract in two species of wombats. Specifically, we survey the microbes along four major gut regions (stomach, small intestine, proximal colon, distal colon) in a single bare-nosed wombat (Vombatus ursinus) and a single southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons). Our preliminary results show that GI microbial communities of wombats are structured by GI region. For both wombat individuals, we observed a trend of increasing microbial diversity from stomach to distal colon. The microbial composition in the first proximal colon region was more similar between wombat species than the corresponding distal colon region in the same species. We found several microbial genera that were differentially abundant between the first proximal colon (putative site for primary plant fermentation) and distal colon regions (which resemble faecal samples). Surprisingly, only 10.6% (98) and 18.8% (206) of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were shared between the first proximal colon region and the distal colon region for the bare-nosed and southern hairy-nosed wombat, respectively. These results suggest that microbial communities in the first proximal colon region-the putative site of primary plant fermentation in wombats-are distinct from the distal colon, and that faecal samples may have limitations in capturing the diversity of these communities. While faeces are still a valuable and effective means of characterising the distal colon microbiota, future work seeking to better understand how GI microbiota impact the energy economy of wombats (and potentially other hindgut-fermenting mammals) may need to take gut biogeography into account.

## Intrinsic variation in the vertically transmitted core virome of the mosquito Aedes aegypti.
 01.03.2022, _H Coatsworth, J Bozic, J Carrillo, EA Buckner, AR Rivers, RR Dinglasan, DK Mathias_


Virome studies among metazoans have revealed the ubiquity of RNA viruses in animals, contributing to a fundamental re-thinking of the relationships between organisms and their microbiota. Mosquito viromes, often scrutinized due to their public health relevance, may also provide insight into broadly applicable concepts, such as a "core virome," a set of viruses consistently associated with a host species or population that may fundamentally impact its basic biology. A subset of mosquito-associated viruses (MAVs) could comprise such a core, and MAVs can be categorized as (i) arboviruses, which alternate between mosquito and vertebrate hosts, (ii) insect-specific viruses, which cannot replicate in vertebrate cells, and (iii) viruses with unknown specificity. MAVs have been widely characterized in the disease vector Aedes aegypti, and the occurrence of a core virome in this species has been proposed but remains unclear. Using a wild population previously surveyed for MAVs and a common laboratory strain, we investigated viromes in reproductive tissue via metagenomic RNA sequencing. Virome composition varied across samples, but four groups comprised &gt;97% of virus sequences: a novel partiti-like virus (Partitiviridae), a toti-like virus (Totiviridae), unclassified Riboviria, and four orthomyxo-like viruses (Orthormyxoviridae). Whole or partial genomes for the partiti-like virus, toti-like virus, and one orthomyxo-like virus were assembled and analyzed phylogenetically. Multigenerational maintenance of these MAVs was confirmed by RT-PCR, indicating vertical transmission as a mechanism for persistence. This study provides fundamental information regarding MAV ecology and variability in A. aegypti and the potential for vertically maintained core viromes at the population level.

## Multiomics Reveals the Effect of Root Rot on Polygonati Rhizome and Identifies Pathogens and Biocontrol Strain.
 28.02.2022, _Z Pang, X Mao, Y Xia, J Xiao, X Wang, P Xu, G Liu_


Root (rhizome) rot of Polygonatum plants has received substantial attention because it threatens yield and sustainable utilization in the polygonati rhizome industry. However, the potential pathogens that cause rhizome rot as well as the direct and indirect (via root-associated microbes) strategies by which Polygonatum defends against pathogens remain largely unknown. Herein, we used integrated multiomics of plant-targeted metabolomics and transcriptomics, microbiome, and culture-based methods to systematically investigate the interactions between the Polygonatum cyrtonema Hua root-associated microbiota and pathogens. We found that root rot inhibited P. cyrtonema rhizome growth and that the fresh weight significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.001). The transcriptomic and metabonomic results showed that the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to specialized metabolic and systemic resistance pathways, such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and flavonoid biosynthesis, cycloartenol synthase activity (related to saponin synthesis), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and plant hormone signal transduction, was particularly increased in diseased rhizomes. Consistently, the contents of lactose, d-fructose, sarsasapogenin, asperulosidic acid, botulin, myricadoil, and other saponins, which are functional medicinal compounds present in P. cyrtonema rhizomes, were also increased in diseased plants infected with rhizome rot. The microbiome sequencing and culture results showed that root rot disrupted the P. cyrtonema bacterial and fungal communities and reduced the microbial diversity in the rhizomes and rhizosphere soil. We further found that a clear enrichment of Streptomyces violascens XTBG45 (HJB-XTBG45) in the healthy rhizosphere could control the root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum spaethianum. Taken together, our results indicate that P. cyrtonema can modulate the plant immune system and metabolic processes and enrich beneficial root microbiota to defend against pathogens. IMPORTANCE Root (rhizome or tuber) reproduction is the main method for the agricultural cultivation of many important cash crops, and infected crop plants rot, exhibit retarded growth, and experience yield losses. While many studies have investigated medicinal plants and their functional medicinal compounds, the occurrence of root (rhizome) rot of plant and soil microbiota has received little attention. Therefore, we used integrated multiomics and culture-based methods to systematically study rhizome rot on the famous Chinese medicine Polygonatum cyrtonema and identify pathogens and beneficial microbiota of rhizome rot. Rhizome rot disrupted the Polygonatum-associated microbiota and reduced microbial diversity, and rhizome transcription and metabolic processes significantly changed. Our work provides evidence that rhizome rot not only changes rhizome transcription and functional metabolite contents but also impacts the microbial community diversity, assembly, and function of the rhizome and rhizosphere. This study provides a new friendly strategy for medicinal plant breeding and agricultural utilization.

## Long-term effect of epigenetic modification in plant-microbe interactions: modification of DNA methylation induced by plant growth-promoting bacteria mediates promotion process.
 01.03.2022, _C Chen, M Wang, J Zhu, Y Tang, H Zhang, Q Zhao, M Jing, Y Chen, X Xu, J Jiang, Z Shen_


Soil microbiomes are considered a cornerstone of the next green revolution, and plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are critical for microbiome engineering. However, taking plant-beneficial microorganisms from discovery to agricultural application remains challenging, as the mechanisms underlying the interactions between beneficial strains and plants in native soils are still largely unknown. Increasing numbers of studies have indicated that strains introduced to manipulate microbiomes are usually eliminated in soils, while others have reported that application of PGPB as inocula significantly improves plant growth. This contradiction suggests the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying microbe-induced growth promotion.
