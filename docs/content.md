Fouchier et al. reported the isolation and genome sequencing of a novel coronavirus tentatively named "human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC)" from a Saudi patient presenting with pneumonia and renal failure in June 2012. Genome sequencing showed that this virus belongs to the group C species of the genus betacoronavirus and phylogenetically related to the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 previously found in lesser bamboo bat and Japanese Pipistrelle bat of Hong Kong respectively. Another patient from Qatar with similar clinical presentation and positive RT-PCR test was reported in September 2012. We compare and contrast the clinical presentation, laboratory diagnosis and management of infection due to this novel coronavirus and that of SARS coronavirus despite the paucity of published information on the former. Since 70% of all emerging infectious pathogens came from animals, the emergence of this novel virus may represent another instance of interspecies jumping of betacoronavirus from animals to human similar to the group A coronavirus OC43 possibly from a bovine source in the 1890s and the group B SARS coronavirus in 2003 from bat to civet and human. Despite the apparently low transmissibility of the virus at this stage, research preparedness against another SARS-like pandemic is an important precautionary strategy.

Whether zinc (Zn2+) regulates barrier functions by modulating tight-junction (TJ) proteins when pathogens such as Shigella alter epithelial permeability is still unresolved. We investigated the potential benefits of Zn2+ in restoring impaired barrier function in vivo in Shigella-infected mouse tissue and in vitro in T84 cell monolayers. Basolateral Shigella infection triggered a time-dependent decrease in transepithelial resistance followed by an increase in paracellular permeability of FITC-labeled dextran and altered ion selectivity. This led to ion and water loss into the intestinal lumen. Immunofluorescence studies revealed redistribution of claudin-2 and -4 to an intracellular location and accumulation of these proteins in the cytoplasm following infection. Zn2+ ameliorated this perturbed barrier by redistribution of claudin-2 and -4 back to the plasma membrane and by modulating the phosphorylation state of TJ proteins t hough extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 dependency. Zn2+ prevents elevation of IL-6 and IL-8. Mice challenged with Shigella showed that oral Zn2+supplementation diminished diverse pathophysiological symptoms of shigellosis. Claudin-2 and -4 were susceptible to Shigella infection, resulting in altered barrier function and increased levels of IL-6 and IL-8. Zn2+ supplementation ameliorated this barrier dysfunction, and the inflammatory response involving ERK-mediated change of phosphorylation status for claudin-2 and -4. Thus, Zn2+ may have potential therapeutic value in inflammatory diarrhea and shigellosis. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Our study addresses whether Zn2+ could be an alternative strategy to reduce Shigella-induced inflammatory response and epithelial barrier dysfunction. We have defined a mechanism in terms of intracellular signaling pathways and tight-junction protein expression by Zn2+. Claudin-2 and -4 are susceptible to Shigella infection, whereas in the presence of Zn2+ they are resistant to infection-related barrier dysfunction involving ERK-mediated change of phosphorylation status of claudins.
